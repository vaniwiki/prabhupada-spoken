**Prabhupāda:**

> veda-śāstra-kahe-'sambandha', 'abhidheya', 'prayojana'
> 'kṛṣṇa'-prāpya sambandha, 'bhakti'-prāptyera sādhana

Now, the //Vedas// or the scriptures, why they are made? This... It is not practically made, but it is coming down by traditional process, by hearing. Just like we accept our father by hearing. A child is born, and when the child sees his other brothers and sisters calling a gentleman "father," he also begins to say "father." There is no question of studying. By hearing. How does a child learns to call the father a father? Because he hears. Others are calling "father," so he also calls "father." There is no evidence. There is no study. Similarly, the Vedic knowledge was coming by hearing. There was no need of book. But when this age, Kali-yuga, began, five thousand years before, they were recorded, and systematically... //Vedas,// first there was only one //Veda, Atharva Veda.// Then Vyāsadeva, just to make it clear, divided into four and entrusted his various disciples to take charge of one school of //Veda.// Then again he made //Mahābhārata, Purāṇas,// just to make the Vedic knowledge understandable by the common man in different ways. But the principle is the same.

So Lord Caitanya says the purpose of //Veda// is... //Veda-śāstra kahe-'sambandha'. Sambandha.// What is our relation? Our relation is, as //Vedānta-sūtra// says, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. So the relation with God is that we are... Everything is born out of the energy of God. So we are also born... Therefore we say God, "Father." This is accepted in every religion. There is no argument. Now, what is the relationship between father and son? Is it the relationship to exact only from father? There is no duty of the son, simply to take from father? No. There is duty. If a son is sensible and grown-up, he knows that "I have got my duty: to love my father." That is very simple thing, to love father. "Father has done so ma..., so much for me, I am just going to own the estate of father, and I am enjoying the earnings of my father. So is it not my duty to show respect to my father?"

So those who are against God-principle, those who are not God-minded, they're the lowest creature. They're the lowest creature. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ:// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]] "Anyone who does not recognize God, he's the lowest of the lowest creature." //Duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ.// These, these terms have been used. Just like //mūḍha,// ass; //duṣkṛtina,// miscreant; and //narādhamāḥ,// and lowest of the mankind. Mankind. Mankind is meant for recognizing. This is the life. In animal life, one cannot recognize that there is God and everything is coming from God. They cannot read //Vedas,// or scriptures. They cannot take any instruction. So these //Vedas// and scriptures are there for human beings. Therefore, a human being, so-called human being with two hands and two legs, but they're animals who do not accept the authority of scripture and do not accept the existence of God, so //Bhagavad-gītā// very nicely describes them, //narādhamāḥ. Naradhāmāḥ// means lowest of the mankind. So our civilization is going to the lowest of the mankind. And we are, we are trying to advertise ourself that we are advancing, but the... Yesterday some boy came: "Who is God? I am God." He was speaking like that. You see. And he appears to be educated student. From his appearance it appears that he, he's educated. So this is education is going on, that they're going to be the lowest of the mankind. The purpose of education is to make man the highest of the mankind, but modern education is teaching lowest of the mankind. And if some of the students are taught to become highest of the mankind, their guardians become disturbed: "Oh, my son is going to be highest of the mankind? Swamijī, you are playing dangerous things." Oh. Just see. Swamijī's speaking, "No, don't smoke. Don't take tea. Don't have illicit connection with women. Be upright. Be devotee." "Oh, Swamijī's dangerous." And if somebody teaches, "My dear boys, take LSD, go to hell, and become mad. Go to the lunatic asylum," "Oh, that is..." What can be done? This is the situation.

So we are situated in a society of the lowest of the mankind. Always remember this, that we are situated in a civilization which is the lowest of the mankind. Not only I am speaking of your United States... All over the world. Even India, where so much culture was made for understanding God, this foolish government, they're also teaching this. You see. So this is the, I mean to say, age. Don't think that I am particularly criticizing some country or community. This is the age, Kali. It is called Kali. Hypocrisy, simply hypocrisy. Kali means full of hypocrisy. So we have to be very careful. We have to... //Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. And the illusory energy is very strong. At any moment, little slackness... [aside:] Oh, you have wrongly put. [break] So this is... Actually, we should understand. So Lord Caitanya says that //sambandha// means we have to revive, we have to reestablish our lost relationship with Kṛṣṇa, or God. That is civilization. The relationship is there already because I am born. The supreme cause is Kṛṣṇa, or God. But I have, some way or other, I have forgotten that. Therefore these scriptures---//Vedas,// this //Bhāgavata, Śrīmad-Bhāgavata, Bhagavad-gītā//---these scriptures are reminding me. They're made for reminding me that "Your relationship with Kṛṣṇa is eternal. Why you have forgotten? Therefore you are suffering." We have discussed the //śloka,// verse, that //bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād īśād apetasya viparyaya-smṛtiḥ. Vipa...// Because we have taken a, a reverse position for, for, forgetting the Supreme, therefore we are put into anxiety. Because we have taken a reverse position. "Who is God?" //Viparyaya-smṛtiḥ.// This very word is used. //Viparyaya// means topsy-turvied. "Your memory has become topsy-turvied. Therefore you are suffering." But he will not agree. "No, we shall adjust. We shall make laws. We shall make agitation. We shall form party and go on defying God, and we shall be happy in this way." So this godless civilization is now generating the Communist party. So the dangerous position, we are coming.

So anyway, one who takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa, he'll not be put into danger. Rest assured. So //'kṛṣṇa'-sambandha, 'bhakti'-prāptyera sādhana.// So I have to revive my relationship. Relationship is there; simply I have forgotten. So I have to revive it, or remember it, that "Oh, I am such and such." //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. I have to become a great soul by surrendering unto God. So that surrendering process is //bhakti,// or devotional service. My relationship is eternal with the Supreme. I have forgotten it. Now, that relationship is that He is the original father of everything, and we are all sons. So we have to become... We have... So long we have been disobedient. Now we have to become obedient. That's all. This obedience means that... What is called? Obedience, the first law of discipline. So as soon as the people of this world, so-called advanced world, they become obedient to God, then there will be discipline and there will be peace. There is no discipline now. They are not agreeable to follow any rules and regulation. Everyone is God. Everyone is dog. Everyone can do anything, whatever he likes. So there is no discipline. So //bhakti, bhakti,// devotional service, means to undergo a, a disciplinary system of our life so that automatically we can revive our lost relationship with Lord, God, and we become happy. This is called //bhakti. Abhidheya-nāma 'bhakti', 'prema'-prayojana.// And why? What is the use? Suppose we don't revive our relationship? Then you'll be disturbed. You are after peace and prosperity.

So what is the basis of peace? Basis of peace is love. Do you think that you do not love anyone and you become peaceful? No. How it is possible? Therefore, if you love God, then you can love everyone. And if you don't love God, then you cannot love anyone. Because He's the center. Just like in our... Of course, here your family system is different. In India there is joint family system. Suppose a girl comes... The parents, they engage the girls and boys. Say a girl belonged to a different family. But when she is married, she comes to family, and because the husband and wife is related, at once the husband's brother becomes related, the husband's mother becomes related, the husband's father becomes related. Husband's... Everyone becomes related at once. The central point is husband. Before that, before any connection with that central point, this boy's father, brother had no relation with that girl. You see? So central point must be there. So if you can love God, then everything in relationship with God, then you can love. You can love every man. You can love your country. You can love your society. You can love your friend. Everyone. That is the point. They are thinking in a different way, "Why shall I love God only? Why shall I love God? I shall love my family. I shall love my country. I shall love my..." Oh, no, you cannot love. It is not possible. Because you are missing the central point. These are facts. //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. One who does not love God, he cannot have any good qualification. Why? //Mano-rathena asato dhāvato bahiḥ.// Because he'll simply speculate on the mental plane and he will fall down under the spell of this material energy. He has no standing. However materially, academically qualification he may be, it is clearly stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that //yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā.// We have given you the list, twenty-six qualifications. As we become advanced in devotional service, all these good qualities will develop automatically. There is no need of legislation. There is no need of, but, anything, but all those good qualities will develop. Otherwise, what is the meaning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Is it a sentiment or fanaticism? No. It is a science. If you follow the rules and regulation and systematically, then all these qualities will develop. You'll practically see it. And as soon as these qualities are there, then you become actually lover of your country, you become a lover of your fellow man. You become friend, God, everything.

So if each and every man becomes like that... Of course, it is not expected that each and every man will become like that. At least, ten percent of the population become Kṛṣṇa consciousness---there is guarantee, peace in the world. Because //ekaś candra...// We do not require many moons in the sky. Only one moon is sufficient to drive away the darkness. //Varam eka guṇī putra na ca mūrkha-śatair api.// Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, "It is better to have a qualified son than to have hundreds of fools." So the modern civilization is going on in that way, godless civilization. If some percentage of the civilized human beings become Kṛṣṇa conscious, that will bring forth peace. Otherwise it is not possible. It is therefore necessity. Lord Caitanya says, //abhidheya 'bhakti', 'prema'-prayojana. Prayojana// means it is necessary. //Puruṣārtha-śiromaṇi prema mahā-dhana.// Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's preaching was based on this principle: //premā pumartho mahān.// What is the objective of human life? He said that "Objective of human life is to attain love of God." That's all. That makes him perfect, nothing more. He..., His mission has been described by one of the //ācāryas,// Viśvanātha Cakravartī. He has studied. He said that the mission of Lord Caitanya is //ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanaya:// "Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is //ārādhya.//" //Ārādhya// means He is worshipable. He's the only worshipable personality. //Ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanaya tad-dhāmaṁ vṛndāvanam:// "And as Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshipable, similarly His place of pastimes, Vṛndāvana-dhāma, is also worshipable." //Ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanaya tad-dhāmaṁ vṛndāvanam.// And what is the best kind of worship for Kṛṣṇa? Now, //ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇa yā-kalpitā:// "The highest kind of worship is as demonstrated by the damsels of Vṛndāvana, the girlfriends of Kṛṣṇa." Yes. They had no adulteration. Simply they were always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is going outside of the village, and they were thinking at home, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa's," I mean to say, "sole is so soft. How He's wandering in the jungle? There are so many particles of stone. Must be pricking." In this way. Kṛṣṇa is there; they are at home, but they are thinking of Kṛṣṇa, how He's walking, how His soft foot is suffering. In this way they are always absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are not Vedantists. They are not //brāhmaṇas.// They are not educated. They were cowherds girls. But their love of Kṛṣṇa was so intense that Lord Caitanya recommends, "Oh, there is no better worship than, than it was being demonstrated by the damsels of Vṛndāvana." //Ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā.// Then what is the source of understanding Kṛṣṇa? //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Amalaṁ purāṇam.// If you study //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// then you attain all these things. //Śrī-caitanya-mahaprabhor matam idam.// And //premā pumartho mahān.//

So the book, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam;// the ideal worship, the damsels of Vṛndāvana; Kṛṣṇa is the worshipable object; and the necessary of life, necessity of life, is to attain love of God. This is the whole mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, sum and substance. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu is saying here, //puruṣartha-śiromaṇi prema mahā-dhana.// People are, have their objective of life, everyone. //Dharmārtha-kāma-mokṣa// ([[books:sb:4:8:41|SB 4.8.41]], [[books:cc:adi:1:90|Cc. Ādi 1.90]]). Their objective of life is... Of course, nowadays people are different. Formerly... It is Vedic version, //dharma,// to make them religious. Therefore every civilized nation has some sort of religion. Religious... Because without becoming religious, there is no possibility of peace and prosperity. So this is one of the aim of human society, religious. And why religious? //Dharma-artha.// Then the economic condition will be better. If all people are religious, then economic condition will be better. //Dharma-artha.// And why economic condition better wanted? //Kāma. Kāma// means then the necessities of your life will be fulfilled nicely. //Dharma, artha, kāma,// and //moksa.// Then what is the end? That if you are peacefully in the society, then you can culture for your liberation. So //dharmārtha-kāma-mokṣa// [[books:sb:4:8:41|[SB 4.8.41]]], so generally these four principles are the aim of human society. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that "Yes, these are all right." But //premā pumartho mahān:// "With all these things, if you have no love of Godhead, it is all nonsense. All nonsense. Therefore try to love God and everything will be all right." This is the mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //premā pumartho mahān.// So //prema.// Here, also, Lord Caitanya says that we should understand our relationship with God. We should act in that way. That means in devotion. Then we shall have the highest perfection of life, love of God, and our mission of human life will be fulfilled.

Thank you. [end]
