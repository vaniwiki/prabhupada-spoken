**Prabhupāda:**
So we have discussed the different names of Manu, the father of man. In different millenniums there are different Manus, and the present Manu is Vaivasvata Manu. Out of the fourteen Manus, now it is, the eighth Manu is going on at the present moment. That means this is about one o'clock in the day of Brahmā, just past noon. It is going to be afternoon. And during Brahmā's sleeping time all these planets will be, I mean to say, not annihilated, but inundated, you see, devastation with water. So after the finishing of these fourteen Manus here will be evening, night, and there will be devastation, and half of this universe, up to the sun planet, or above that, everything will be covered with water. Instead of air, there will be water. Then again there will be again... This is //kaṇḍa-pralaya.// And //mahā-pralaya// means, when Brahmā dies, then everything is finished.

So these fourteen Manus we have mentioned yesterday. Now //yugāvatāra. Yugāvatāra// means just like there are four //yugas:// Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara, Kali. The ages of each //yuga// we have mentioned already. Now in the Satya-yuga, when the //yugāvatāra// comes, He is white. He is Hayagrīva in the Satya-yuga, as white as our Hayagrīva brahmacārī. Yes. He is white. And //rakta. Śukla-rakta-kṛṣṇa-pīta-krame cāri varṇa.// In the Satya-yuga when the incarnation of //yugāvatāra// comes, His complexion is white. And in the next //yuga,// Tretā-yuga, the complexion is red. And the next //yuga,// Dvāpara-yuga, the complexion is black, Kṛṣṇa. And the next, Kali-yuga, the complexion is yellow. Lord Caitanya is yellow.

> kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ
> sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
> yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair
> yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ
> [SB 11.5.32]

In this age, Kali-yuga, this is the //yugāvatāra,// Lord Caitanya. And His description is mentioned in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Five thousand years before, it was mentioned that //kṛṣṇa-varṇam. Kṛṣṇa-varṇam// means that He is in the category of Kṛṣṇa. //Svayaṁ-kṛṣṇa.// You can take the meaning of //kṛṣṇa-varṇam// like this. //Varṇa// means a caste or classification. So He is in the classification of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa. Or if you don't take that meaning, then //kṛṣṇa-varṇam// means He is always chanting "Kṛṣṇa." //Kṛṣṇaṁ varṇayati. Varṇayati// means chanting. So //kṛṣṇa-varṇam,// always engaged in Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. So this is the first feature. The symptoms of the //yugāvatāra// of this age is given like this, //kṛṣṇa-varṇam.// Either you can say that He is //varṇayati... Varṇayati// means describing only Kṛṣṇa. Lord Caitanya preached... His preaching mission was //ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanaya,// Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the only worshipable object. And He was always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. This is the first symptom of Lord Caitanya.

//Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣā akṛṣṇam.// By complexion He is //akṛṣṇa. Akṛṣṇa// means not //kṛṣṇa,// not black. Not black, you may take, if not black, then it may, as there are four colors, so He may be white, He may be red, He may be yellow. Now, out of these three colors, in the Satya-yuga white is already done. And in the Tretā-yuga red is already appeared. Then the balance is //pīta. Kṛṣṇa// is also done. Then the //pīta,// the yellow. So therefore His color is very golden colored, yellow. Lord Caitanya's complexion not exactly white like you, but He was golden color, golden with yellowish tint, a very nice complexion, Lord Caitanya's. He is... Therefore His name is Gaurāṅga. Gaurāṅga means white complexion. Another name is Gaurasundara, "very beautiful." So //kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam// [SB 11.5.32]. //Tviṣā, tviṣā// means by complexion //akṛṣṇa,// not //kṛṣṇa.// Although He is Kṛṣṇa, His complexion is not //kṛṣṇa.// Then next? //Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam.// He is always accompanied by His associates. You will see in the picture. There is Nityānanda Prabhu, there is Advaita Prabhu, there is Śrīvāsa, and always He was... From the beginning, when He was a child... Not child. When He was a boy, He started the //saṅkīrtana// movement. You see the picture: He is surrounded. And throughout whole, so long He lived, He was present on this world, that was... He was surrounded by this Hare Kṛṣṇa party. //Sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam.// This is the //yugāvatāra// of this age.

Now, //kalau, kalau,// "in this age," especially meant. Now, how to worship Him? Does He require any grandeur, any throne or any decoration? No. Nothing. Anywhere and everywhere you can worship Him. How? //Saṅkīrtanaiḥ,// this chanting. Keep the picture of Lord Caitanya with His associates, this, as picture we are painting, we have got, and any part of the world, you sit down and go on chanting, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma... So no expense, no nothing. This is the recommendation for this age. Therefore this picture and this sound vibration should be preached all over the world. And rest assured there will be peace and prosperity. This should be the mission of this society, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is Lord Caitanya's mission. He ordered,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

//Para-upakāra// means "do good to others." "You are born in //Bhāratavarṣa.// You are not meant for exploiting others. You are meant for doing good to others." That is His mission. //Para-upakāra. Para-upakāra// means "Do good to others." It is specially mentioned, //bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra. Bhārata-bhūmite,// in this land of //Bhāratavarṣa,// one who has taken his birth as a human being... Human being. "I am not talking," Lord Caitanya said, "I am not talking of others, less than human being. Anyone who has taken his birth as human being..." //Janma sārthaka kari. Janma sārthaka.// How? How to make your life perfect? Now, just you become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

So He advised every Indian that this is the mission of Indian mission. Because in this age all over the world there will be hopelessness, now this mission should be started from India. That was His prediction. This mission should be started, and the Indians should take responsibility for starting this mission all over the world. And they will be happy. There will be too much unhappiness in this age, and by spreading this mission there will be happiness. That is His prediction. So it is not a manufactured thing. We are just following the footprints of Lord Caitanya. So let us follow it nicely. There will be peace and prosperity all over the world. Yes.

So in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there is quotation when Kṛṣṇa was born. It is the system of Vedic system. There are ten kinds of //saṁskāras,// reformation. And how much careful this Vedic civilization is, that a child will be born and he is taken care of since the day of the, I mean to say, joining, conjugation of the father and mother. //Garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.// How much they were expecting that a good son will come, and he will be so good that the society will be happy, the country will be happy, the world will be happy. Never they prescribed unwanted children like cats and dogs. No. So therefore there was //garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.// Before the father and mother conjugate there is ceremony, //garbhādhāna,// for the higher caste. The higher caste were made not artificially. They had to follow nine great principles, then they are higher caste, not by rubber stamp, just like Gandhi wanted to do, taking the //banghis,// the sweepers, and rubber-stamping "//harijana.//" No. This is a process. Everyone is open to become a //harijana,// but not by rubber stamp but by training. That training is required. People are avoiding the training and simply speculating in the mind, foolishness. How the world can improve? There must be training. Without training, simply by mental speculation, one can make any... //Manasā mathurāṁ gacchasi.// Oh, you have to work. If you want to go California, you have to go there. Simply I am thinking, "I am going to California, California," will that...? No.

So similarly, actually if you want peace, then you have to work. The process is there. The process open for everyone, but you have to take it. Otherwise it is not possible. Therefore Lord Caitanya says, //manuṣya-janma sārthaka kari:// "You first of all make yourself perfect; then preach." Don't become yourself nonsense, and you become a preacher. No. //Āpani ācari prabhu jīvera śikṣāya.// Preacher must be in his life perfect. Then he can become a preacher. If I smoke, how can I say that "You do not smoke"? Then how... Modern days is, "What I do, that you may not do. What I say, you do." Why shall I follow you? You are not doing? So Lord Caitanya therefore says, //janma-sārthaka kari.//

So when Kṛṣṇa was born... Of course, He is pure. He is God. But the social and the scriptural rules and regulations were followed. So when a child is born the astrologer is called. Still that system is followed. But due to this Kali-yuga the astrologer has also become a false, and this has become a formality. Somebody is following; somebody is not following. So as soon as a child is born... You will find Mahārāja Parīkṣit, as soon as he was born, his grandfather, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, called for astrologer. This is called //jāta-karma.// Just after the child is born, this astrologer will come and he will see the moment, the astronomical situation, and make a horoscope, and then immediately his future activities and everything will be clearly made, that "This child is born at such and such moment. He will be like this and this." And that will be... You will be surprised... Not surprised. This is calculation. In my horoscope it is written there, "At the age of seventy years he will go across the sea." It is written there. Yes. And there are so many things still. So this astrologer was so accurate. I have got that horoscope. Not here. If some day I shall, then will show. It is clearly written there that "This time he will go across the sea." Just see. The circumstances became so that I have come. So astrology is so nice.

So when Kṛṣṇa was born the same principle was followed. Astrologer was called for, and there were good astrologers. And the great astrologer, a famous astrologer who came to see Kṛṣṇa's birth affair, he was Gargamuni. His name was Gargamuni. Yes. So that Gargamuni, by astrology, said to Kṛṣṇa's father Nanda Mahārāja, "This boy, this child who is born as your son, He had three colors before." //Āsan varṇās trayo hy asya:// "This child had three colors before. I see." Just see the astrology. From astrology he says that "He had three colors before." That means God. "He had three colors before." //Gṛhṇato 'nuyugaṁ tanūḥ:// "According to the age, according to the millennium, He had three other colors." //Śuklo raktas tathā pīta idānīṁ kṛṣṇatāṁ gataḥ:// "And He had that white color and red color and yellow color. //Idānīm,// just now, He has assumed this black color." So this was the astronomical calculation of Kṛṣṇa's birth. //Satya-yuge dharma-dhyāna karāya 'śukla'-mūrti dhari'.//

Now, //śukla-mūrti,// that white incarnation of God, He will teach the people... The incarnation of God, why does He come? That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. //Tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham.// The incarnation of God comes... When there is discrepancy all over the world about religious principle, the incarnation comes. So Lord Caitanya says that in the Satya-yuga this incarnation of God in white color, He preached meditation, //dhyāna.// Therefore meditation is for the Satya-yuga. Satya-yuga means when cent percent people are pure. That is called Satya-yuga. And Tretā-yuga means 75% are pure, 25% impure. And Dvāpara-yuga means 50%, 50% pure and 50%... And Kali-yuga means 75% impure and 25% may be pure. [laughter] This is Kali-yuga. And we are thinking we are advancing. Such a foolish civilization, they are less than 25% pure, they do not know what is purity, and they think that they are advancing in civilization. Civilization means to purify. The Aryans, Aryans means advance. And what way advance? Advance in eating? Advance in sleeping? No. Advance in purification. They are called Aryans. And the most advanced purified is called the //brāhmaṇa.// And less than that, the //kṣatriya.// And less than that, //vaiśyas.// And less than that, the //śūdras.// And less than that, they are //caṇḍālas.// This is the classification of the human society. What is that classification? Due to this purity, who is pure, pure, purer, purer, and purest. So unless we become purest, we cannot approach Kṛṣṇa.

So here it is said, //satya-yuge dhyāna karma.// This //dhyāna,// this medi... Why meditation? They were all pure; still, to become purest, //dhyāna karma. Kardamake vara dilā yeṅho kṛpā kari.// And He gave some, bestowed some blessings to Kardama Muni. Kardama Muni, he was a great penance taker, and he worshiped this incarnation of God, and he was blessed with a son. He was also incarnation of God, Kapila Muni. Kapila Muni. He is also incarnation of God, and He preached the //sāṅkhya// philosophy, original. Later on, in the, just in this Kali-yuga, there is an imitation //sāṅkhya// philosophy. So there are two //sāṅkhya// philosophies: atheistic and nonatheistic. So [non]atheistic //sāṅkhya// philosophy you will find in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// preached by Kapila. His name was Kapila, Kapila Muni, son of Kardama and Devahūti. His mother's name was Devahūti; His father's name was Kardama. So this Kardama's name is mentioned here:

> kṛṣṇa-'dhyāna' kare loka jñāna-adhikārī
> tretāra dharma yajña' karaya 'rakta'-varṇa dhari

Now in the Satya-yuga the people were trained to meditate on Kṛṣṇa. They had, I mean to say, 100,000's of years they used to live, 100,000's of years. Just like we cannot..., our limit is one hundred years only, similarly, in the Satya-yuga the limit of living was 100,000's of years. And people would meditate. There are history... Meditate some fifty hundred thousands of years..., no, fifty thousands of years. Just like Vālmīki Muni. Vālmīki Muni meditated for fifty thousands of years, and then he wrote //Rāmāyaṇa.// The //Rāmāyaṇa// is not an ordinary book. You see? Therefore //Rāmāyaṇa// is so much popular in India. Before the appearance of Rāma, he wrote //Rāmāyaṇa,// all the activities of Rāma. So this Vālmīki Muni... And what this Vālmīki Muni was? This Vālmīki Muni was a dacoit, a plunderer. He used to plunder, I mean to say, innocent men on the road, kill him and take everything. That was his business. But by chance, he was associated with Nārada Muni, and he rectified him. This is the process. When a devotee meets even a dacoit like Vālmīki Muni, he becomes... Nārada Muni elevated so many fallen souls. This Vālmīki Muni was also. So he was given this //mantra,// "Rāma." He could not chant it. Then he was advised to just the opposite, //māra. Māra// means dead body. So //māra māra māra.// Three //māra// means one "Rāma" is there. So in this way he was initiated and he became a great sage. For sixty thousands of years he meditated simply on "Rāma, Rāma, Rāma, Rāma, Rāma, Rāma." And when he was liberated, he wrote this //Rāmāyaṇa.//

So that is the function of the Tretā[Satya]-yuga. And Tretā-yuga... //Tretā dharma yajña karāya...// [aside:] There is one bug. Throw it. So in the Satya-yuga this meditation is possible, not in this age. Therefore those who are imitating the process of the Satya-yuga, they are simply wasting time. That's all. That is not recommended. Nobody can meditate in this age. //Kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ// [SB 12.3.52]. There are different //yugas,// millennium, and there are different processes. In this age, this is the process, //kalau saṅkīrtana, hari-kīrtanāt,// simply chanting. Sit down anywhere, everywhere, and go on chanting, chanting, chanting.

So as the ages, either it is fallen or risen, that doesn't matter. Just like if you go to a doctor, he has got different kinds of medicine, different kinds of treatment. There is no question of being hopeless. There is no question of being hopeless. If we follow the injunction given in these authorized scriptures, then even in this Kali-yuga we can attain perfection. And the process is this: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

Thank you very much. Any question? [end]
