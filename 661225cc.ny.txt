**Prabhupāda:**

> dvāpare bhagavān śyāmaḥ
> pīta-vāsā nijāyudhaḥ
> śrī-vatsādibhir aṅkaiś ca
> lakṣaṇair upalakṣitaḥ

> namas te vāsudevāya
> namaḥ saṅkarṣaṇāya ca
> pradyumnāyāniruddhāya
> tubhyaṁ bhagavate namaḥ

These are some of the //mantras// for offering respect to Kṛṣṇa. This //mantra,// you may particularly note down:

> namas te vāsudevāya
> namaḥ saṅkarṣaṇāya ca
> pradyumnāyāniruddhāya
> tubhyaṁ bhagavate namaḥ

> ei mantre dvāpare kare kṛṣṇārcana
> 'kṛṣṇa-nāma-saṅkīrtana'-kali-yugera dharma

So in the Dvāpara-yuga, this was the process, //kṛṣṇārcana,// worshiping Kṛṣṇa, and in the Kali-yuga, this //pīta,// this yellowish-colored incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, Lord Caitanya, He's to be worshiped by this //saṅkīrtana// movement. //Saṅkīrtanair yajñair.// This is also called sacrifice, this //saṅkīrtana yajña.// There are different kinds of //yajña.// This is called //nāma-yajña,// sacrifice of the holy name of the Supreme Lord.

> dharma pravartana kare vrajendra-nandana
> preme gāya nāce loka kare saṅkīrtana

The process is that the Lord chants and He dances Himself, and people follows similarly. Just like we are painting the picture: the Lord is dancing and everyone is following. And that following can be continued even up to date. God is always there. It is not that Caitanya is not present here. He's always present, and, whenever there is //saṅkīrtana,// there is this //kīrtana// by the devotees, sincere devotees, it is said that Lord Caitanya is there, present. //Tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyanti mad-bhaktāḥ. Śuddha-bhakta,// those who are pure devotees. Pure devotees means without any material desire. Those who are pure devotees, those who are determined to go back to Godhead, to Kṛṣṇa, they are called pure devotees. They have lost all interest for any material enjoyment. They are now determined. They are called pure devotees. So this //saṅkīrtana// movement creates pure devotees, who gradually loses all interest in the material enjoyment.

Now this verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// as I've already explained to you, that is also cited here:

> kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ
> sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
> yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair
> yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ
> [SB 11.5.32]

That Personality, incarnation of God, who is yellowish color and is accompanied by His associates, confidential associates, He is worshiped by this process of //saṅkīrtana// in this age of Kali.

> āra tin-yuge dhyānādite yei phala haya
> kali-yuge kṛṣṇa-nāme sei phala pāya

//Āra tina-yuge// means this is Kali-yuga, and there are, there were other three //yugas:// the Satya-yuga, the Tretā-yuga, Dvāpara-yuga. There are different processes of realizing God. So Lord Caitanya says, "In other three //yugas,// what was achieved by meditation, by sacrifice, by temple worship, now that can be achieved in this age by //saṅkīrtana. Kalau...//"

> kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann
> asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ
> kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya
> mukta-bandhaḥ paraṁ vrajet
> [SB 12.3.51]

This is a //śloka,// verse, from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in connection with conversation with Mahārāja Parīkṣit and Śukadeva Gosvāmī, and, when the description of this Kali-yuga was given, Mahārāja Parīkṣit became very sorry that, because he was a pious king, he was thinking always of the welfare of the citizens. So when he heard about the description of the Kali-yuga, he was very much disturbed in his mind. Although he was going to die, still he was so compassionate: "Oh, in the age of Kali, the people will suffer so much."

So, when he was so sorry, so Śukadeva Gosvāmī encouraged him, "Mahārāja, don't be sorry. There is very nice process in the Kali-yuga. In the midst of so many difficulties of this age, there is one boon, and that boon is one can become liberated from this material entanglement altogether simply by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma..." //Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya.// It was especially mentioned, //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya// [SB 12.3.51], simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, one can become... This is the greatest boon in this age. Although there are so many difficulties, full of miseries, increase in the greatest volume... The world is, material world is miserable. Just like cold season, this winter season, today we are feeling most inconvenienced. Similarly, this material world is always miserable. But still, in this age it is most miserable, in this age of Kali. But the boon is, the first-class boon is that even there are so many miserable conditions, in the midst of all those disadvantages, one can become free from all contamination simply by //kṛṣṇa..., kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya.// Simply by this.

> kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ
> tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ
> dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ
> kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt
> [SB 12.3.52]

What was achieved in the Satya-yuga by meditation, what was achieved by offering sacrifices in Tretā-yuga, and what was achieved in the Dvāpara-yuga by worship, that can be achieved in this age by //saṅkīrtana yajña.//

> dhyāyan kṛte yajan yajñais
> tretāyāṁ dvāpare 'rcayan
> yad āpnoti tad āpnoti
> kalau saṅkīrtya keśavam

A similar passage... The two above passages, they are quoted from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Another passage is quoted from //Padma Purāṇa. Padma Purāṇa,// there are eighteen //purāṇas, purāṇam.// Six //purāṇas// are in the modes of goodness, and six //purāṇas// are in the modes of passion, and six //purāṇas// are in the modes of ignorance---for different people. Just like in a best institution, there are different classes, different kinds of books of learning, gradual process. Similarly, this Vedic culture is so nice, they don't give one class of literature for all. No. There are so many different literatures because there are so many varieties of people. How can you convince you, convince all classes of people by one literature? No. That is not possible. Now the people are here in your country, they are losing interest in religion because the Bible was given to a certain class of people long, long years before. So people are far advanced in scientific knowledge. So that does not appeal. So they're all... We should always remember that there are always different classes of men, and for different classes... The aim is all the same that, see, "Two plus two equal to four." Nothing. But different classes of men there are. So different class of arithmetic, higher mathematics, middle mathematics, lower mathematics. The mathematical, mathematical principle is the same, "Two plus two...," "One to three to nine." There is no other figure.

So similarly, there are eighteen //purāṇas.// Those who are in the modes of passion, those who are in the modes of ignorance, they should also have some chance. For them, oh, "You go and you worship this demigod." Because we are, every one of us, hankering for material acquisition. The disease is that we are simply thinking of... //Idam adya mayā labdham.// "Today I have got so much material possession, and next day I shall have so much, and next day I shall have so much. And next day and next day...," and when next day I shall go away---that's all. Finish. This is material disease. They're always hankering after. So there are different hankerings, there are different persons. So, the demigods, "All right, you worship. You want this thing, you want a beautiful wife? All right, you worship Umā. You want to be very learned man? All right, you worship this Devī-Sarasvatī. Oh, you want to be, get out of your disease? All right, you worship the sun-god." So in this way, there are recommendations.

But in the //Bhāgavata,// after all these recommendations, the //Bhāgavata// concludes,

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta paramaṁ puruṣa
> [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]

If you have got any desire, still, you go to Kṛṣṇa. You worship. Kṛṣṇa recommends. //Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna.// Even if you go to Kṛṣṇa for asking something material profit, still it is better. Don't go to other demigods. //Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante anya devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]. The foolish persons, they do not know that the demigods, they cannot offer any benediction. They cannot offer. They are not fool. Just like here in this institution, although you are free, you very kindly ask me, "Swamijī, can I take this fruit?" Why? This is etiquette. Similarly, the demigods, they are not fools. Suppose one man worships a demigod and asks some benefit. Oh, demigod will ask the Lord, Supreme Lord. Or, in another sense, the demigods also do not know, because they are also living entities like us. But //īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that this person, this particular man, is wanting something, "All right, give him. Give him." Kṛṣṇa is... This is freedom. There is no argument, "Oh, why Kṛṣṇa has arranged like this?" He arranges out of His causeless mercy. He can say, He can stop asking the individual soul. But He does not do that. Why He shall do? Then there is no meaning of independence. "All right, you want it? I have arranged it. Take it. Take." So He asks the demigod, "All right, he's asking from you? Give him. Give." So this is going on.

So therefore there are different kinds of literature because there are different kinds of people. But the ultimate literature is, the substance of all Vedic literature is the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Kṛṣṇe sva-dhāma upagate dharma-jñānādibhiḥ saha.// It is..., there is a verse in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// When Kṛṣṇa was present He personally gave this //Bhagavad-gītā// and all knowledge. So many people took knowledge. There is another //gītā, Uddhava-gītā.// That was spoken to Uddhava. That is in //Bhāgavata;// this is in //Mahābhārata, Bhagavad-gītā.// So there is a question by the Śaunaka Ṛṣi that, after departure of Kṛṣṇa, wherefrom knowledge should be searched? So they recommended this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So in the //Padma Purāṇa// also there is similar passages. In //Bhāgavatam// also, there are similar passages. In all Vedic literature, the same thing is there. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. The last target and the last goal, ultimate goal, is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. //Bhāgavata// says, //akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā// [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]. Even if you are this materially desiring, still, you should go to Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa also confirms, //bhajate mām ananya bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. //Api cet su-durācāro.// One should not ask God. But still, if one asks, he's accepted, because he has come to the point, Kṛṣṇa. That is his good qualification. He's in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So all faults there may be, but when one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, everything is nice. Just like there are so mu..., so much snowfall. As soon as there is rise of sun, everything finished. Everything finished. //Kṛṣṇa sūrya sama.// Only we have to wait when the sunrise will be there. Then all these disturbances will be at once cleared.

So we have to take to //kṛṣṇa-sūrya// and everything will be cleared.

> kaliṁ sabhājayanty āryā
> guṇa-jñāḥ sāra-bhāginaḥ
> yatra saṅkīrtanenaiva
> sarva-svārtho 'bhilabhyate

//Sarva-svārtho 'bhilabhyate.// There are nice verse. You see? Here it is said, //yatra saṅkīrtanenaiva.// This Kali-yuga, this age of Kali, we are condemning so much. But even the demigods, they, I mean to say, highly eulogize this Kali-yuga. Why? Why? Oh, here is a great opportunity. Simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, //yatra saṅkīrtanena. Yatra// means in this Kali-yuga, simply by this //saṅkīrtana// movement, simply by chanting, //sarva-svārtho 'bhilabhyate,// all interest is served. Your material interest, your spiritual interest---every interest will be served. Lord Caitanya also said, //ihā haite sarva-siddhi haibe tomāra.// Just... Even if you are materially desiring something, that also will be fulfilled by simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is such a nice thing. This is... Therefore we call //mahā-mantra.// All...

> pūrvavat likhi yabe guṇāvatāra-gaṇa
> asaṅkhya saṅkhyā tāṅra, nā haya gaṇana

> cāri-yugāvatāre ei ta' gaṇana
> śuni' bhaṅgi kari' tāṅre puche sanātana

Now here is a very trick. Sanātana Gosvāmī, he was politician. He was minister. Now when Lord Caitanya was describing about the incarnations, especially of the incarnation of the Kali-yuga, now he's asking, Sanātana Gosvāmī is asking to Lord Caitanya,

> rāja-mantri-sanātana-buddhye bṛhaspati
> prabhura kṛpāte puche asaṅkoca-mati

He's asking very frankly because he's very intelligent. He was minister.

> 'ati kṣudra jīva muñi nīca, nīcācāra
> kemane jāniba kalite kon avatāra?'

"My dear Sir, Lord Caitanya, I am the lowest of the lowest. I am very fool number one. So I may inquire from You that how can I understand that this is the incarnation of this age, Kali-yuga?"

> prabhu kahe---anyāvatāra śāstra-dvāre jāni
> kalite avatāra taiche śāstra-vākye māni

"Oh, why you are in confusion? As other incarnation are to be understood from the indication of the //śāstras,// similarly, we have to understand from the indication of the //śāstra// who is incarnation." //Sarvajña munira vākya-śāstra-'paramāṇa'.//

Now //śāstra,// the scripture, is the most first-class evidence, //sarvajña munira vā..., sarvajña...// Because //śāstras// are written not by ordinary person. Not by Rabindranath Tagore, a sex play. [?] No. [laughs] //Śāstras// are written by liberated persons. Therefore //śāstra,// scripture, have got so many advantages and so much respect. So therefore Lord said: //sarvajña munira vākya-śāstra-'paramāṇa'. Śāstra paramāṇa.// Just like [we] see in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// four hundred thousands of years after there will be //avatāra,// Kalki, and His father's name, His birthplace, is already mentioned there. This is called //śāstra.// Five thousand years before //Bhāgavata// was written, and there is indication that in such and such age, in such and such province, in such and such family, Lord Buddha will appear. That is written there. And five thousand years before, ago, the, the symptoms of Kali-yuga is already written there. And we are experiencing.

In the //Bhāgavata// you'll find, //svīkāra eva hy udhvāhe:// "In the Kali-yuga, marriage will be performed simply by agreement." Just see. Another... //Lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam:// "People will think by keeping long hairs they will be very beautiful." It is stated in //Bhāgavata.// They'll look very beautiful. //Lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam.// It is written there if you see. It is not story. //Svīkāra eva hy udvāhe. Dāmpatye ratim eva hi:// "And husband and wife relation means sex. That's all." If the husband has got sex power, then there will be no divorce. These are all written there. Simply sex life, husband and wife relationship. Simply sex life. //Vipratve sūtram eva hi:// "And one will be considered a //brāhmaṇa// simply by this thread." These are all written there. A two-cent-worth thread, you get it..., "Oh, you have got thread. Oh, you are a //brāhmaṇa.//" That's all. This is going on in India. Two-paisa-worth //brāhmaṇa.// He has all the qualification of less than a //caṇḍāla,// but, because he has got this nonsense thread, he's considered a //brāhmaṇa.// So these things are all mentioned. And we have to believe it also that, in the last stage of the Kali-yuga, nobody will understand what is God, what is religion. And there will be no supply of these grains. Now we are getting all these grains. But, as you are, as you are thinking grain is not meant for human being, they are meant for animals, all right, God will stop completely. Then you'll have to live only on the seeds and animal flesh. That is also mentioned. There will be no milk. There will be no sugar. There will be no grain. These things are mentioned. Therefore //śāstra,// it is called //śāstra. Sarvajña. Sarvajña// means the //śāstra// is written by persons who know, who knows the, I mean to say, past, present and future. Everything is clear. Therefore we have got so much respect for scripture. The foolish people say, "Oh, it is also written by man. Why shall I...?" Yes, it is written by man. That's all right. But he's not a man like you. He's liberated man. There are different kinds of men. So don't think all men are like you, all men are like you fools.

So here it is said, //sarvajña munira vākya-śāstra-'paramāṇa.'// Therefore... //Tasmāt śāstra pramāṇa ante.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also, that everything should act, should be acted in terms of the //śāstra.// Just like when you go to post something, you are, you are directed by the postal guide. //Śāstra pramāṇa// only. So Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as Kṛṣṇa has given stress upon the evidence, on the scripture, similarly, Lord Caitanya also is giving stress. The question is very interesting. The question is how one should accept a person or a body as incarnation. Lord Caitanya says that through //śāstra,// by the evidence of //śāstra.// So many fools, they are presenting themselves as incarnation. An intelligent person should see whether this fool is mentioned in the //śāstra.// He's presenting himself as incarnation. Whether his activities are, his characteristics is mentioned in the //śāstra?// Then accept. Otherwise, don't accept. This will be discussed more.

Thank you very much. [end]
