**Prabhupāda:**
This is a quotation from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Eleventh Canto. It is very nicely compared with the body of the Supreme Lord and our situation in that partic..., body, in different positions. Now, this verse says that the highly intellectual class of men, they are situated on the mouth of the Supreme Lord. The intellectual persons are considered the mouth of the Supreme Lord. And the next, the administrators, or the protector class of men... Not administrators; practically protector... //Kṣatriya// means protector. Protector class of men, they are considered to be the arms of the Supreme Lord. And the productive class of men, they are considered as the waist of the Supreme Lord. And the laborer class of men, they are considered to be the legs of the Supreme Lord. So anyone in this society, or in this human society or material world, they must have some situation. There is some positive position of everyone in the body of the Supreme Lord.

So this comparison means that just like our head, our arms, our waist and legs, they're all important, being constitutional parts of the body, similarly, every one of us are important in consideration, being the parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. But the conclusion is that //ya eṣāṁ puruṣaṁ sākṣād-ātma-prabhavam īśvaram, na bhajanti.// Now some of us are the arms of the Supreme Lord, some of us the mouth of the Supreme Lord---any part of the body we are situated---but if we don't work according to our positive situation, then the result is //ya eṣāṁ puruṣaṁ sākṣād-ātma-prabhavam īśvaram.// One who does not serve according to his position, then //sthānād bhraṣṭāḥ patanty adhaḥ,// he falls down from that position, and this falldown is this material body. It is very nice example. We have got a particular position in the body of the Supreme Lord. Just consider the //viśva-mūrti,// the gigantic universal form of the Lord. And we are situated in different parts of the body of the Supreme Lord. So as parts and parcels of the body, we have got particular duty. If we do not accept that... Just like the hand. If it does not work, then it is in diseased condition. So //patanty adhaḥ.// Diseased condition means the falldown. So, so long we are not situated in the transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord, we should consider that we are in diseased condition, paralyzed position. Just the hand, when it is paralyzed, it cannot work, it cannot serve the body, similarly, when we are detached from the service of the Supreme Lord, that is our diseased condition, and to be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or to be in devotional service is our positive position. So one should try to be situated in his positive position, and being freed from this diseased condition of sense enjoyment. Just like the paralyzed hand. It is simply... It is called a hand, but it has no function to act as hand. Similarly, without transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord, a so-called intelligent class is simply in name intelligent class. But it is not... He's actually not intelligent, because there is no function. So this is the instruction of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

> jñānī jīvan-mukta-daśā pāinu kari' māne
> vastutaḥ buddhi 'śuddha' nahe kṛṣṇa-bhakti vine

Now, there are many speculators. After some philosophical speculation, they think, "Now I have realized that 'I am the same. I am same God. I am God.' " So this process is called //jñāna// system. So Lord Caitanya says that these //jñānīs,// they artificially think that "Now I have realized myself," but actually that is not self-realization. Self-realization is when you actually engage yourself in the service of the Lord. That is your self-realization. Because you are part and parcel, your duty is to serve the whole. If you think yourself, "I am whole," that is wrong conception. That is wrong conception. You are not whole. How you can be whole? So there are so many examples that think ourself that "I am the Supreme. I am the whole." Just the other day I was speaking to you: it is the last snare. We are not whole. We are part and parcel. Just..., just the hand in healthy condition, as part and parcel of the body, is very nice. When the hand is working in his position, that position is very nice. But when it is not working---it is in diseased condition---do you think it is very nice? No. Paralyzed hand, simply in the name it is hand, but it has no function. So that sort of understanding, without actually reinstated in the healthy state of our spiritual life, simply thinking that "I am now spiritually realized; I am the Supreme," this is not pure. So Lord Caitanya says, //vastutaḥ buddhi 'śuddha' nahe:// "That sort of conception is not purified intelligence. That is still contaminated intelligence."

Then He is giving an evidence again from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas
> tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ
> āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ
> patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ
> [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]

This is prayer to the Lord by Brahmā, who says that //ye 'ravindākṣa...// Kṛṣṇa is sometimes addressed as the lotus-eyed because His eye... He's very beautiful. So anyone who has got his eyes just like petals of the lotus flower, it is considered very beautiful. So He, He's addressed, //aravindākṣa,// "O the lotus-eyed..." //Vimukta-māninaḥ.// "Those who are thinking falsely that 'I am now liberated. I have realized myself that I am the same. I am God,' " //vimukta-māninaḥ tvayy asta-bhāvāt,// "but he has no information of Kṛṣṇa... He's thinking artificially that he is liberated, but he has no information of Kṛṣṇa." //Tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ:// "Therefore, although he has advanced in, to some extent in the spiritual realization path, but because he has not reached up to You, Kṛṣṇa, therefore his intelligence is not yet fully purified. He's still contaminated." In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also the same thing said, //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. After many, many births, one who is actually intelligent, actually in..., wise, in knowledge, he surrenders unto Him. So those who are thinking that "I am now liberated simply by some volumes of philosophical speculation," so //Bhāgavata// says, "No, your intelligence is not yet purified because you have not yet approached Kṛṣṇa."

So what is the result for such persons? //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. They might come to the highest position, because Brahman realization is also very high position. It is not ordinary thing, that "I am not this body. I am Brahman." This realization is not ordinary realization. It is also realized after purification of the mind. But that is also not sufficient. So //āruhya kṛcchreṇa,// after undergoing severe penances and philosophical research, even though he has risen up to the point of perfection, to the point of perfection, still, //patanty adhaḥ,// he has the chance of falling down. And that we have seen in many instances. Many //sannyāsīns,// they were very educated, and they have undergone severe penances, but without Kṛṣṇa realization they fall down. How they fall down? Sometimes they fall down, becomes a victim of a woman. Sometimes they fall down for this philanthropic work. Sometimes they fall down in the matter of opening hospitals. Generally they fall down by becoming a victim, victim of woman, and others, they also become victim of this material nature, become attracted by this social work. So a //sannyāsī// is supposed to be renounced order. He has nothing to do with this material world. Then why should he come to the social order or philanthropic order? That is his falldown. That is his falldown. He should be situated completely in spiritual order. He has nothing to do. He should simply be engaged in spiritual service, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the perfection of renouncement.

Renounce means... What is renunciation? Renunciation means //paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 2.59]]]. One is engaged in the material activities, being attracted in it, and when he loses his attraction in this material world---he is attracted by the Supreme, Kṛṣṇa---that is renunciation. By seeing the Supreme, he rejects this. Just like sometimes we also, if we get some better type of foodstuff, then we reject inferior type of foodstuff naturally. //Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.// Because, "Oh, it tastes very nice, so let me take this, reject this." Similarly, material attraction is so long..., as long as we are not in touch with Kṛṣṇa. As soon as we are in touch with Kṛṣṇa, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the result will be that we shall lose our material attraction. Those who are falling down from Kṛṣṇa consciousness again to the material attraction, that means they are not serious about advancing in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not ordinary thing. It is very easy. At the same time very, I mean, difficult also. Those who are not attracted by the Kṛṣṇa conscious activities, there is every chance of falling down again in the... Because he has no other alternative. Either he has to serve this way or serve that way. If he is not attracted to serve in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he has to serve in material consciousness. So those who are not fixed up in Kṛṣṇa, however he may be advanced in spiritual realization, that, there is falldown. It is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. Again falls down.

> kṛṣṇa---sūrya-sama, māyā haya andhakāra
> yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:31|[Cc. Madhya 22.31]]]

//Kṛṣṇa//---//sūrya-sama.// If you are actually in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is full light, full light. Everything will be seen in its pure perspective. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to know everything as it is. Nothing will be falsely represented to a person who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He knows everything. By the grace of Kṛṣṇa, he gets knowledge, what is what. So //kṛṣṇa//---//sūrya-sama.// Just like in the sunlight. During night, in darkness, we cannot understand what is what. Suppose in darkness, at night, you go up to the roof of the house and you want to see where is your home. You cannot ascertain. But in the light, when the sun is up, you can see: "Oh, that direction is my house." Similarly, as in the sunlight everything becomes clear for our seeing, similarly, in touch with Kṛṣṇa consciousness everything becomes clear, what it is. So for a Kṛṣṇa consciousness person, these material activities appear to be merely false. Not false, but temporary. But he is eternal. Every living entity is eternal. He's interested with eternal happiness. He's not interested, I mean to say, temporary happiness.

So this is the process of understanding.

> kṛṣṇa---sūrya-sama, māyā haya andhakāra
> yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:31|[Cc. Madhya 22.31]]]

Just like when, wherever there is sunlight, there cannot be darkness. That is a fact. You cannot say, "Oh, sunlight and darkness, simultaneously they are existing." No. Actually in the open sunlight there cannot be any darkness. Similarly, as soon as you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, there cannot be any darkness for understanding what is, this material world is. That means the more you make advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the more you understand the nature of this material world.

Thank you very much. Any questions? I have finished little earlier to ask you. [end]
