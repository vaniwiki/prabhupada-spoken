Prahlāda Mahārāja, considering himself born in the lowest, atheistic family, he thinks that "When Brahmā and other big demigods failed to satisfy the Nṛsiṁha-deva, how it is possible for me? I am neither born in a very scholarly family or devotee's family." Because a devotee is supposed to take birth in the family of a //brāhmaṇa// or very rich king or princely order or mercantile family. But Prahlāda Mahārāja was born in a very rich family, and his father was also //brāhmaṇa.// And so... But unfortunately, his father was atheist. Therefore, in spite of his becoming born in the //brāhmaṇa// family, he was designated as demon, //daitya.//

So because Brahmā and other demigods asked Prahlāda Mahārāja to pray, therefore he is suggesting, he is guessing that "Material qualification is no assessment for approaching the Lord." He says that //manye,// "I think." //Manye,// "I think," //dhana. Dhana// means wealth. //Abhijana. Abhijana// means to take birth. Śrīdhara Swami says //abhijana// means //sat-kule janma,// to take birth in high family, in //brāhmaṇa// family, in rich family. And //rūpam, sundarya, śrutam, saundarya. Rūpa// means beauty, and //śrutam// means education. //Ojaḥ, indriya-naipuṇyam. Ojaḥ// means power of sense. A man who can use his senses very nicely, he is called //ojaḥ.// Just like the vultures. The vulture, he can go three, four miles up, but he can see... From that four miles away, he can see whether there is a carcass. So simply by sense power one does not become very great. The example is this: although this creature, vulture, has gone very high... We are human being. We cannot see three, four miles away anything. So sense power... There are different animals who have got different kinds of sense power. Just like dogs. They can smell..., from distant place they can smell whether somebody, outsider, is coming, and he will at once begin barking. Similarly, there are fishes. They have got power of touch. The small fishes can understand that a big fish is coming from miles of distance simply by touch, by connection with water. So the sense power or living power... Suppose if somebody thinks that "I am living for a hundred years," you are living for hundred years, but you go in the forest. You will find one tree is living for seven thousand years. So these powers, by sense power, by your strength of money or by education... Everything is described. Or aristocratic birth, and //tejaḥ. Tejaḥ// means luster of the body, //kānti. Tejaḥ// and //prabhāva, pratāpa,// influence. //Balam// means bodily strength. Suppose you are Sandoz. You have got very good... Just like in your country there are some box fighters, very strong and stout. That is called //balam. Pauruṣam, udyama. Udyama// means industrious. Just like a very poor man, he becomes by his energy very, very rich man. There are many instances in the world. That is called //pauruṣam. Buddhi. Buddhi// means intelligence, //prajñā.// And yoga. Yoga means //aṣṭāṅga-yoga,// the eightfold practice of yoga system.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja says that "All these qualifications are not good assessment for approaching the Supreme Personality of Godhead." He is nullifying. Do not think that because you have got good education or scientific knowledge, then you can understand what is God. That is not possible. Just like the other day we were, I was reading one magazine. In the Bible it is said that God said "Let there be creation," and there was creation. Similarly, in the //Bhagavad-gītā// also, we understand that Kṛṣṇa says, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca:// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]] "These eight gross and subtle material elements, they are My differentiated energy." So these statements of Bible or //Bhagavad-gītā...// We can understand that God created this cosmic manifestation. But in the paper we read the other day that the scientific men believe that there was a chunk in the beginning, and all of a sudden it burst out and the planets came out. [break] So anyone can understand that God is all-powerful. He can create. But the scientist says that "There was a chunk, and creation took place from the chunk." Just see. When you say that God created, one can understand that God is... If a man can create such nice things, skyscraper buildings, very complicated bridge, engineering work, so God is great, He may have greater brain, so He has created this cosmic manifestation. There is a, I mean to say, standard to believe. But how the scientists believe that there was a chunk? And what is the explanation? I cannot understand. From the chunk everything come out. And who made the chunk? The next question should be that "Wherefrom this chunk came?" There is no answer. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja says that all these material qualification cannot satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Now, how God is satisfied? //Ete dhanādaya dvādaśāpi guṇāḥ parasya puṁsaḥ ārādhanāya na bhavanti.// You cannot purchase God by your all these material acquisitions. No. That is not possible. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ:// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]] "One can understand Me simply by devotional service." Nobody can understand. //Bhaktyā mām.// What is that //bhakti?// That is also stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

When one is very advanced in knowledge, //brahma-bhūtaḥ... Brahma-bhūtaḥ// means one who has understood the Brahman, the Supreme. And a //brāhmaṇa// means //brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ,// one who has advanced to such knowledge. Therefore in India it is said that a //brāhmaṇa// is addressed as //paṇḍitajī.// Not //paṇḍitajī// like our late Jawaharlal Nehru. //Paṇḍitajī// means one who knows Brahman. Therefore //brāhmaṇa's// title is //paṇḍita.// And a //kṣatriya's// title is //ṭhākura saheb, mahārāja.// Not //mahārāja-ṭhākura saheb.// And a //vaiśya's// title is //sethjī,// and a //śūdra's// title is //chowdari.// There are respectable terms for the different classes of men. So this //bhakti,// it is not simply sentiment, but it is to understand actually what is God. It is science of God. Otherwise how it is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā?// One who has understood the Supreme, the Absolute, he is called //brāhmaṇa, brahma-bhūtaḥ.// And the symptom is that... How can I understand that he is a //brāhmaṇa// and has understood Brahman? The immediate answer is //brahma-bhūtaḥ.// The test is, one who is completely in knowledge of Brahman, the symptom will be //prasannātmā:// he will be always cheerful. There is no question of anxiety for him. That is //brahma-bhūtaḥ. Prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. There is no lamentation; there is no desire. That is //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage. There is no desire.

Even a hundred years, or, say, about 150 years before, there was in Bengal there was a nice king, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Chandra. He went to a learned //brāhmaṇa,// and he wanted to help him, that "Can I help you?" So the //brāhmaṇa// says, "Oh, I don't require any help. Oh, I am very happy. I have got this tamarind tree. My wife takes some tamarind leaves and makes some soup, and some of my disciples give me some rice. So I have got everything, plenty. Why shall I take your help?" Formerly the //brāhmaṇas,// real //brāhmaṇas,// they refused to take any charity from others, even up to this date, because according to Vedic system, when charity was to be given, it is to be given to the //brāhmaṇas// or the //sannyāsīs.// That is real charity. //Datavyam.// They should be given. Because they are always engaged in Brahman, therefore charity given to a //brāhmaṇa// or a //sannyāsī// goes to Brahman. That is the idea. At the present moment the advertisement is //daridra, daridra-nārāyaṇa:// "Charity should be given to the //daridra,// or the poor." But the //Vedas,// why they recommended that charity should be given to the //brāhmaṇas?// And the //brāhmaṇas,// they do not require. They are so satisfied, but still, people persisted: "The //brāhmaṇas// should take some charity," because the idea is, if the //brāhmaṇas// accept the charity, that money goes directly to Brahman, or God. That is the idea. So //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. When one is situated in that position, that he has no lamentation, no demand, no anxiety, that is called //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage. And next, by becoming into //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage, what are other symptoms? //Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu:// "Oh, he is equal to everyone." Then, when one has attained this perfection of life, then he can execute devotional service. //Mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param.// And by that devotional service, one can understand what is God.

In other place also in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. Now what is //siddhi,// perfection? //Siddhi// means this perfection, //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage. No hankering, no lamentation. That is called //siddhi,// perfection. This hankering and the full of anxiety, this is materialistic. This is materialistic. In comparison to other animals... They have no anxiety, but human being, they have advanced a type of civilization that everyone is in anxiety, always full of anxiety. So Prahlāda Mahārāja says in another place that this anxiety is due to acceptance of the false, material civilization. //Sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]. They have accepted a type of civilization which is //asat. Asat// means which will not exist. Therefore they are always full of anxiety.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja says the same thing in a different way, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be worshiped or satisfied by a devotee, not by others. In other place also the Lord says,

> patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ
> yo me bhaktyā prayacchati
> tad ahaṁ bhaktyā upahṛtam
> aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]

He said that "Anyone who offers Me a little flower, a little fruit, a little water, with devotion..." This is the real thing. Because God is so great, He is supplying foodstuff. //Eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.// "He is supplying all necessities of life to millions and trillions of living creatures, and He is asking me a little flower and little fruit and little water? He is begging? Is He a beggar?" No. The real thing is //yo me bhaktyā prayacchati:// "One who gives Me in devotional love." So God is always anxious of your love, not your material things. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described that as somebody offers you very nice, palatable dishes, varieties of foodstuff, but unfortunately, if you have no appetite, these are all useless because you cannot eat, there is no appetite, similarly, you can make a show of offering so many things to God, but if you have no devotional love, that is not accepted. That is not accepted because God is not poor. He is not begging from you.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja says the same thing: //bhaktyā tutoṣa bhagavān gaja-yūtha-pāya.// These material acquisitions, wealth, education, beauty, and so many other things which is very much evaluated in the material world, they are not qualifications for satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but //bhakti. Bhaktyā tutoṣa.// The example is that there was an elephant who was in danger. He was being dragged by an alligator in the water, and he prayed to Lord Viṣṇu, and he was saved. The example is that the elephant was not even human being. He was animal, but still, because he prayed to the Lord with devotion, so Lord immediately came to save him. This is the recommendation of all the Vedic scriptures. So //bhaktyā tutoṣa.// You can satisfy simply by your love. //Bhaktyā// means //bhakti. Bhakti// means //bhaja sevayā. Bhakti...// Simply you have to develop your service attitude. Service attitude is already there. We are servants by constitution, but we are serving //māyā.// We are so constitutionally servant that after very, very high education, taking all these degrees, oh, we are moving door to door, that "Give me some service." So this service is my constitutional position, but I am serving my lust, my greediness, //kāma. Kāmādīnāṁ kati na katidhā pālitā durnideśās.// We are serving actually, but instead of serving God, we are serving //kamādi,// our lust, our greediness, our senses. In one word we are serving our senses. So the position is there, but when you turn that service spirit to God, that is your success of life. Otherwise it is simply waste of time. //Kāmādīnāṁ kati na katidhā pālitā durnideśās.// Dictated by the lust, by //kāma,// by serving //kāma,// we sometimes do something which is very, very, abominable. Just don't you see the fight? The Pope says that "You cannot use contraceptive method. It is sinful." But actually people are doing that because dictated by //kāma,// lust. It is actually very sinful, it is //brūṇ-hatyā,// murder. So how you can be that happy by continually committing murders? It is not possible. Therefore every religion, the contraceptive method will never be supported. It is //brūṇ-hatyā mahā-pāpa,// according to Vedic literature. So they are now proposing that you cannot use contraceptive devices, but people have become mad after lust. They must use. They are putting the population theory, but I don't believe in it. The population theory, that "Population is increasing; therefore it should be stopped by contraceptive method," Malthus's theory, in economics, they are following that. But actually there is no such problem, because if we understand from Vedic literature, from //Upaniṣad,// it is said, //nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān:// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13] "That Supreme Personality of Godhead is one, and the living creatures are many, many, without any number." //Asaṅkhya:// you cannot count how many living entities are there. So both of them are eternal, God and the living entity, //nityo nityanānām. Cetanaś cetanānām. Cetana// means living. So He is also a living entity, God, and we are also living entities. But what is the difference? That //eka, eka,// that one singular number living entity, or Kṛṣṇa, or God, //eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān,// He is supplying all the necessities of other living entities. So how there can be any population problem if God is supplying everything?

But there is restriction. How there is restriction? When people become godless, there is restriction of supply. Just like practical experience. I am saying from my practical experience that in my childhood I saw that India was exporting millions of tons of rice and wheat and other grains also, oil seed grains, huge export business. That India is now begging grains from other countries. You see. Why? Because they are gradually becoming godless. The population theory I don't believe, because if Kṛṣṇa is supplying, //eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān...// And actually we find that there is no population problem. Amongst the animals, amongst the birds, there is no contraceptive method. They are increasing their population, and they are being fed by God. So why in the human society the population theory is so acute? Because they are becoming less than animals. The animals, they beget, they mate at a certain period, but a human being, at the present moment, they have no such restriction. Any time. Therefore they want contraceptive method.

So this godless civilization is so acute that it is very difficult to make them understand God consciousness or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But still, as a matter of duty, we have to present, submit, these teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// because we are following the teachings of Lord Caitanya, who wanted. He said that //pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma.// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126] All over the world in all the cities and all the villages, everywhere this philosophy of //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]], this philosophy should be preached. And He also stated in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// that,

> bhārata bhūmite manuṣya janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

He has ordered all Indians, //manuṣya janma.// All Indians means those who have taken birth as human beings. //Janma sārthaka kari.// This is very important. The Indians, they have got the opportunity of making their life successful because the spiritual knowledge, the spiritual treasurehouse, is there in India. So //janma sārthaka kara para-upakāra.// First of all you learn yourself what is Vedic knowledge, what is spiritual life, and go and distribute to the rest of the world, //para-upakāra.// They are suffering. This is the mission of Lord Caitanya.

> yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

That is the order. In this old age I have come to your country. Why? Because we are trying to follow the footprints of Lord Caitanya; therefore we have come. Otherwise, in old age who goes out of home? Nobody goes. And anyway, it is our duty to present. What is that presentation? The presentation is //yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa,// very simple thing. You haven't got to manufacture anything. Just like there are many swamis, they come from India, but they manufacture something. But we have no power to manufacture. We simply present what is ordered by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He has ordered, //yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa:// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]] "Whomever you meet, you simply present the instruction of Kṛṣṇa." And this instruction of Kṛṣṇa is //Bhagavad-gītā.// And what is that //Bhagavad-gītā?// Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Just be surrendered to Kṛṣṇa; be Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is... So everything is there. We haven't got to manufacture anything. And simply by strictly following the orders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu everyone can become the spiritual master. Spiritual master means who is strictly following the orders of his superior. He is spiritual master. Spiritual master does not mean that he has got four hands or eight legs or three heads. No. One who is strictly following the orders of his predecessor, he is spiritual master. Just like Arjuna was told by Kṛṣṇa that "This system, //paramparā// system, disciplic succession of spiritual masters, is now lost." //Sa kālena yogo naṣṭaḥ:// "That yoga, that system of yoga is now lost. Therefore I am making you again My disciple."

So if you follow the instruction, although you are not present before Kṛṣṇa, if you follow the instruction of Arjuna or a faithful servant of Kṛṣṇa, then you understand. What was spoken to Arjuna, you can also understand. It is not very difficult. Prahlāda Mahārāja also is speaking in that capacity because he is also a disciple of Nārada. So he is saying, //bhaktyā tutoṣa bhagavān gaja-yūtha-pāya.// These material acquisitions are no good for understanding Kṛṣṇa or God. Simply you become a devotee. And how devotional attitude becomes elevated? That is also mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā// and all Vedic literatures, especially in //Bhāgavatam,// that //ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. By your material senses you cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa. //Nāmādi:// the first beginning of understanding Kṛṣṇa is to understand His name. This is the beginning of //bhakti. Nāma ādi. Nāma,// the name, should be the first. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. Because immediately we can understand what is the form of God, how does He look. It is very..., not immediately. But this //nāma// we can hear. Kṛṣṇa has given us the capacity that as soon as somebody chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, even a small child can hear. Oh, he... They imitate. Now we go on the road, and the small children, they say, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." Just see. //Nāma// is so strong that the boys, they also chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is so easy. We have seen it. The small children immediately, they clap, "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa." And some of our students' children, in Buffalo they are dancing, in San Francisco. I received recently one letter from the mother of my disciple. He [she] wants to instruct his two children, other two children. So it is so nice. It doesn't require any material acquisition. Simply God has given you this nice apparatus, ear. Simply you hear Hare Kṛṣṇa.

So //bhaktyā tutoṣa bhagavān gaja-yūtha pāya. Yathā kevala-bhaktyaiva gajendrāya tuṣṭuyavaḥ [?].// The example is Gajendra, the elephant. It was not even a human being. Now, how he satisfied? You have seen that picture of, that... Here I don't find that picture in my apartment, that a calf is by the side of Kṛṣṇa, and it is trying to lick up the body of Kṛṣṇa like this, and Kṛṣṇa is embracing immediately. What this animal has got? No education, no strength, no beauty---nothing of the sort. Simply he has got the feeling: "My Lord, I love You." That's all. //Bhaktyā tutoṣa bhagavān gaja-yūtha-pāya.// So this is the universal form of spiritualism, the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. Anyone... It is practical. All my students here in the Western world, America and Canada and other parts, none of them are either Hindus or Indians. I think I have... I have got only one or two Indian disciples in these parts. And all of them, they are foreigners. They belong to foreign religion. They belong to foreign country. How they are understanding? Do you mean to say these educated boys are dancing and chanting without understanding? Are they fools? No. They are realizing //bhaktyā,// because they have adopted the means of //bhakti. Bhaktyā tutoṣa bhagavān gaja-yūtha-pāya.//

So this //bhakti// is open for everyone. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. It doesn't matter whether he is born a Hindu or //brāhmaṇa// or nonsense or heathen. Doesn't matter. Simply if he takes the path seriously, then //te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim:// he attains the highest perfection of life. Simply one has to follow. The same thing is confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// And Prahlāda Mahārāja also is confirming here, //viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha pādāravinda-vimukhāt śvapacaṁ variṣṭham:// "My dear Lord, I think a //śvapacam, śvapacaṁ variṣṭham...//" //Śvapaca// means... //Śvapacaṁ variṣṭham. Śvapaca. Śva// means dog, and //pacati,// one who cooks dog. That means for eating purpose. They are called //caṇḍālas,// dog-eaters. In India still, in the Assam side, there are still dog-eaters. They enjoy //kukurrpita. Kukurrpita.// They make a kind of cake by burning a dog. So they are called //śvapaca. Śvapaca// means dog-eaters. So Prahlāda Mahārāja says, //viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutāt. Viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha pādāravinda-vimukhāt.// A //brāhmaṇa// who has got full qualification, twelve qualification, //satya-śamo-damas-titikṣa ārjavaṁ kṣanti, jñāna-vijñānam āstikyam... Brāhmaṇa// means very qualified, a first-class man, all qualified. So Prahlāda Mahārāja says that "If a //brāhmaṇa,// even though he is qualified with all the twelve qualities, but if he is not a devotee, then I think a //caṇḍāla// who is born of a family of dog-eaters, if he is devotee, he is //variṣṭham.// He is glorious. He is glorious." //Viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha pādāravinda-vimukhāt śvapacaṁ variṣṭham.// That is the opinion of all great sages. There are many such passages. //Śvapacaṁ variṣṭham. Caṇḍālo 'pi dvija-śreṣṭhā hari-bhakti-parāyaṇaḥ.//

So one has to become, because this devotion is from the spiritual platform. It is not the material consideration. Material consideration is that personal beauty, personal strength, wealth, education. These are all material. But when there is //bhakti,// this is from spiritual platform. The spiritual platform, the spirit soul has no connection with these material qualifications. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja says, "Even though a //brāhmaṇa// has got all the qualifications..." They are all, after all, material qualifications. The //brāhmaṇas// means they are situated in the modes of material goodness, the //kṣatriya// means they are situated in the quality of material passion, the //vaiśya// means they are situated in the mixed quality of passion and ignorance, and a //śūdra// means who is situated in the material quality of the modes of ignorance. And those who are less than that, the //śūdras,// they are called //caṇḍālas// or //śvapaca.// So a //brāhmaṇa// is estimated the high-class man. Why? That is also materially estimation. But if he has no devotion to the Lord, then that is... That means he has no spiritual qualification. Then a person who is born in the family of dog-eaters, if he has got this //bhakti,// spiritual qualification, he is more than that.

> viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha
> pādāravinda-vimukhāt śvapacaṁ variṣṭham
> manye tad-arpita-mano-vacanehitārtha-
> prāṇaṁ punāti sa kulaṁ na tu bhūrimānaḥ

"Because that person, although he is born in a //caṇḍāla// family, because he becomes a devotee, he can deliver his forefathers. But the person who is simply puffed up, born in high family, he cannot deliver himself, what to speak of others." He cannot deliver even himself, and what to speak of others.

So this verse we shall discuss next meeting. Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Any questions? [break] ...very good, but it has got a good sound also. Yes? [break]

**Haṁsadūta:**
//...kāma artha// and //mokṣa// are the four goals of life, but otherwise there wouldn't be any description of the four goals of...

**Prabhupāda:**
Please stop. //Dharma-artha-kāma mokṣa// ([[books:sb:4:8:41|SB 4.8.41]], [[books:cc:adi:1:90|Cc. Ādi 1.90]]). Then what is your next question? Because they are already godless, the world is already sick. What is the purpose of //dharma? Dharma,// the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata// says, //sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ. Paro dharma// means the highest quality //dharma.// What is that? //Yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.// The purpose of //dharma-artha-kāma-mokṣa// means to come to this platform of //bhakti.// The //Bhāgavata// says that,

> dharma-svanuṣṭitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viśvaksena kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed yadi ratiṁ
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

The purpose of //dharma artha kāma// is to come to the platform of //bhakti.// If one does not come to that platform, simply as a matter of formula and rituals, the //Bhāgavata// says, it is simply waste of time. //Śrama eva hi kevalam.// Why Prahlāda Mahārāja says that //viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha pādāravinda-vimukhāt?// That is very good, to be in the platform of goodness, but you have to make further progress. Goodness is not perfection, because this world is so that even in the platform of goodness there is passion and ignorance. It is not unmixed. //Sattva, sattva-guṇa. Sattva-guṇa// is the goodness. So one has to transcend the platform of goodness. That is called //śuddha-sattva.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //traiguṇya-viṣaya-veda nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna:// "My dear Arjuna, so far the Vedic injunctions are concerned, they are material, //traiguṇya.//" Somebody is in goodness, somebody is in passion, somebody is in ignorance. Therefore the division is //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// "But," He advised him, //nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna,// "just transcend to the three qualities of this material nature." That transcendental position is this //bhakti.// So unless one comes to the platform of //bhakti,// simply by //dharma artha kāma mokṣa// will not give him the highest perfection. The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// therefore, begins with this understanding: //dharma projjhita-kaitavo 'tra. Kaitava// means cheating. Cheating. So in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the so-called religiosity, which is more or less cheating, is //projjhita, prakṛṣṭa-rūpena ujjhita,// is completely swept over. So //dharma artha kāma mokṣa// is not the highest perfection. Generally, people, they take to religiosity for material gain, //artha, dharma, artha.// And material gain means to satisfy the senses, //kāma.// And when they are frustrated in satisfying the senses, they then want //mokṣa.// So after keeping in //mokṣa, brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā... Mokṣa// means this world is false, and Brahman is //satya.// But because he has no Brahman engagement, therefore, even after leaving everything to search out Brahman, he comes again back to this material world for philanthropy work, for feeding the poor, for hospitalization. So this is coming and going, coming and going, coming and going. So real status of perfection is that you have to transcend even this position of //mokṣa. Dharmaḥ projjhita kaitavo 'tra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. The Śrīdhara Swami, a great commentator on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// he says, //atra mokṣa, mokṣābhisandhy api nirastam:// "Oh, the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is above the idea of liberation." So unless we come to that point, //pañcama puruṣārtha,// fifth dimension... The //dharma,// first, the //artha,// second, //kāma,// third, //mokṣa,// fourth, and devotion is the fifth, fifth platform. //Adhokṣaja, adhokṣaja.// There are different stages of understanding: //pratyakṣa, parokṣa, aparakṣa, adhokṣaja, aprakṛta.// The ordinary understanding, direct perception, is called //pratyakṣa.// Now, higher than the //pratyakṣa// understanding is //parokṣa,// means to gather knowledge from the higher authorities. And above that, //aparokṣa,// realization. And above that, //adhokṣaja. Adhokṣaja// means beyond the understanding of these material senses. And above that, there is //aprakṛta,// completely transcendental. So the //bhakti// is on the transcendental platform, beyond the //adhokṣaja.// [break]

**Devotee (1):**
Is it all right to desire Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is the only desire you should have. //Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [Nārada Pañcarātra]. If your desire is only concentrated on Kṛṣṇa... Just like the calf. He came to Kṛṣṇa: "Kṛṣṇa, I want You. That's all." And Kṛṣṇa embraces. That's all. If you simply want Kṛṣṇa, that is all perfection. //Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim.// If you have simply accepted Kṛṣṇa, there is no need of any more austerities or penances and knowledge. You have taken the real thing. And //nārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim.// And if you have not come to that stage, to accept Kṛṣṇa, then all your energy wasted in so-called penance and religion and---all spoiled. So if you actually began to love Kṛṣṇa, it is very nice. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply by loving Kṛṣṇa. It is very easy. You love here, there so many. You just try to love Kṛṣṇa and stay in transcendental state. Love is there, but we are misplacing our love. That is our folly. Place that love to Kṛṣṇa. You haven't got to learn how to love. You know. Everyone knows. So you place that love to Kṛṣṇa, and you are always... In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said,

> māṁ ca vyabhicāriṇi-
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

"Anyone who is always engaged in unalloyed devotional service," //sa guṇān samatītyaitān,// "he has already transcended all the material qualities." //Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate:// "He is on the path of becoming Brahman." Brahman means transcendental stage. So simply by engaging yourself in devotional service, immediately you come to the Brahman platform. Immediately. All these boys who are engaged in the..., they are on the Brahman platform. They are not on the platform //dharma artha kāma mokṣa.// They have already transcended. Yes?

**Guest (2):**
You questioned about contraception method, not the birth. The world is not composed not entirely of //brāhmaṇas.// There are //śūdras,// too, who are oriented exclusively towards //kāma.// Now they are //śūdras// because they are //śūdras,// because they are not anything else. Well, but they receive medical care as if they were //brāhmaṇas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
But do you mean to say //śūdras// should be allowed to kill? Law, the state law, does allow that "He is a //śūdra.// He is a lower class of man. Let him commit murder, and the law will not be applicable to him"? Does it mean? This contraceptive method is equivalent to commit murder. So either you are //śūdra// or a //brāhmaṇa// or //kṣatriya,// but it doesn't matter. If you commit murder, then you are putting yourself in difficulties.

**Guest (2):**
Is it true that in India //śūdras// are kept more leniently than //brāhmaṇas// are?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. No. Why?

**Guest (2):**
I just wondered.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. The law does not ask, "Are you //brāhmaṇa// or are you //śūdra?//" But according to Vedic system, rather, //brāhmaṇas// are treated very leniently because they are not so sinful. Just like Aśvatthāmā. He happened to be a //brāhmaṇa,// and he committed a great sin, killing the five innocent... [end]
