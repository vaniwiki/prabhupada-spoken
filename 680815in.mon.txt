**Note:**
When Yamunā starts //kīrtana// with "Hare Kṛṣṇa," Prabhupāda stops her, saying, "//Vandanam. Vandanam.// Prayer. Prayer." Then Prabhupāda leads them in //Vande 'ham.// At end of prayer, Prabhupāda says, "Chant," and Yamunā starts leading Hare Kṛṣṇa //kīrtana.// Prabhupāda chants prayers to the Six Gosvāmīs by himself.]

**Prabhupāda:**

> kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī
> dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau pūjitau

You can get up. Can anyone follow on the harmonium, this? Mukunda, you can follow. [sings]

> kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī
> dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau pūjitau
> śrī-caitanya-kṛpā-bharau bhuvi bhuvo bhārāvahantārakau
> vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau

[Prabhupāda continues playing //karatālas// while speaking] This today, a devotee is being initiated, so we are praying to the lotus feet of the Six Gosvāmīs, who inaugurated this movement under the instruction of Lord Śrī Caitanya. Who are they? //Śrī rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.// Just try to chant these six names. [sings] [devotees chant] //Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.// Repeat. Again. //Rūpa, sanātana,// two, //vande rūpa-sanātanau, raghu-yugau.// There were two Raghunāthas. One Raghunātha Bhaṭṭācārya and one Raghunātha dāsa. Two Raghunāthas, and Rūpa, Sanātana. //Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.// [chants first verse again] So what was their business? //Kṛṣṇot-kīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau.// Always engaged in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇotkīrtana.// Hare Kṛṣṇa means //Kṛṣṇa-kīrtana. Kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau. Nartana// means dancing. So chanting and dancing. That was their business. //Kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī.// And Kṛṣṇa //kīrtana,// whenever one is merged in Kṛṣṇa //kīrtana,// that means he is merged into the ocean of love of Kṛṣṇa. That should be the test. As soon as "Kṛṣṇa," this sound is vibrated, one immediately becomes merged into the ocean of love. That is the sign of pure devotion. Immediately. So these Gosvāmīs, they... //Premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī.// They merged immediately into the ocean of love of God. [sings] //Kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī, dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau pūjitau.// And these Gosvāmīs were dear both to the devotees and nondevotees. Not that they were simply liked by the devotees, but nondevotees also liked them. That was their position. A devotee's position is //ajāta-śatru,// he has no enemy. He has no enemy. //Ajāta-śatru. Nirmatsara, nirmatsara// means because they are not envious. A devotee is always open to everyone. There is no question of discrimination, that "This person should be allowed to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and this person should not be allowed." No. In the material platform there is difference, high, low, man, woman, this or that. But in the spiritual platform there is no such difference. Therefore they were nonenvious, //nirmatsara,// and because they were nonenvious, //pūjitau, pūjitau// means they are worshipable. A person should be worshipable because he's nonenvious. //Śrī-caitanya-kṛpā-bharau,// such kind of position can be attained by one who has acquired the mercy of Lord Caitanya. //Śrī-caitanya-kṛpā-bharau bhuvi bhuvo bhārāvahantāra.// And such person can deliver the suffering humanity from this material contamination. Therefore we offer our respectful obeisances unto the Six Gosvāmīs, Rūpa, Sanātana, two Raghunāthas, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa, and Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī. //Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.// Repeat.

> nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau
> lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau
> rādhā-kṛṣṇa-padāravinda-bhajanānandena mattālikau
> vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau

[Śrīla Prabhupāda continues playing //karatālas// while speaking] //Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau,// they were expert in scrutinizingly studying all the scriptures. //Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau. Nipuṇau// means expert. Why? //Sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau.// To establish real religion in the world. Real religion. Just yesterday we have received one letter from Mr. Renovate, Vancouver. He says that the Canadians, they want real religion. That's very good, encouraging. Anyone, if he is anxious to have real religion, for him this is the best thing, this //kṛṣṇa-kīrtana-gāna-nartana.// So without religion, human society is nothing but animal society. It is simply polished animalism. So these Gosvāmīs, they made so many books to guide us. You have read Rūpa Gosvāmī's //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.// That is the first direction in the line. So they always worked very hard, day and night. Their business was writing books or chanting and dancing. And other necessities, eating, sleeping, mating and fearing, they practically abolished. There was no question of mating, there was no question of fearing. And sleeping, they used to sleep utmost one and a half hour daily in twenty-four hours. And eating, that is also practically nil. When they felt hungry they would go to some householder's home and beg one //capati// or two //capatis.// That's all. Finished. So //nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau.// Why? //Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.// The mission of saintly persons is simply to think how this suffering humanity will become happy by spiritual consciousness. That is their business. They are not for exploiting. The whole material world is trying... One man is trying to exploit another; one nation is trying to exploit another nation; one society is trying to... This is struggle for existence. They have invented this law that "Might is right." You struggle, and if you are powerful... Just like there is now struggle between Russia and America, or China and America. This is going on. So everyone is suffering. The struggle for existence means a condition of suffering. And these saintly persons, devotees of Kṛṣṇa, not only devotees of Kṛṣṇa, any devotee of God, they are, their business is to see how people become happy. //Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.// Therefore, //tribhuvane mānyau.// The devotees are worshiped not only in this planet but in other planets also---wherever they will go.

There is a nice verse in Cāṇakya Paṇḍita... //Vidvatvāṁ ca nṛpatyāṁ ca naiva tulyaṁ kadācana.// He says that a rich man and a learned man cannot be compared. There is no comparison. Why? Because //sva-deśe pūjyate rājan vidvān sarvatra pūjyate.// A rich man may be honored in his own country but a learned man, a devotee of God, he will be honored wherever he goes. //Sva-deśe pūjyate rājan vidvān sarvatra pūjyate.// So this is the position of devotee. Therefore a devotee, wherever he goes he'll be honored. Therefore a devotee has no distinction whether it is heaven or hell, because Kṛṣṇa is with him either in heaven or hell. So where there is Kṛṣṇa, there is no question of hell. It is Vaikuṇṭha. Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he did not enter Jagannātha temple at Purī. He thought himself, that "I am born in Muhammadan family. These Hindus, they're against any Muhammadans entering the temple. Why shall I go and disturb them? I shall chant here." So Jagannātha Himself was coming daily to him. This is the power of devotee. He hasn't got to go to Jagannātha, but Jagannātha comes to see him. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to come daily to Haridāsa Ṭhākura. When He was going to take bath in the sea, so He would first of all enter Haridāsa's cottage: "Haridāsa, what you are doing?" "Yes, my Lord, please come." So this is the position of devotee. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //mad-bhakta-pūjābhyadhikā.// If somebody worships a devotee, that worshipment is more valuable than worshiping Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says like that.

So this is a process... Vaiṣṇava process is //paramparā// process. So today this nice girl is going to be initiated. She must learn this science, this very nice science, and you all Godbrothers and sisters will help her. Anyone who is trying to be Kṛṣṇa conscious, he should be given or she should be given all kinds of facilities. You'll be glad to learn that our Hayagrīva brahmacārī, he is taking one land in West Virginia, 136 acres of land. So I've advised him to develop it into New Vrindaban. So I have got today his letter, the document he is preparing through the lawyer. So it is also a nice project. If by Kṛṣṇa's desire we can develop a center just exactly prototype of Vṛndāvana, it will be very nice. Those American boys and girls who cannot go so long distance, 14,000 miles, they will have facility. So Kṛṣṇa is giving us all facilities. Simply we have to be very sincere and everything will be done nicely.

So let us begin our today's business. [to initiate:] So you come forward. Yes. Take little water, one glass and spoon. This is too big. All right, take it. You know how to do it? Take little water, one, two, three, then four. Do it like that. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [devotees chant //japa//] [Prabhupāda leads devotees in chanting //oṁ apavitraḥ// three times] Now again do that. Three times. Again chant. That door is closed? [break] The purport of this //mantra// is that if anyone is impure, //apavitraḥ... Pavitraḥ// means pure. Anyone, either he is pure or impure, it doesn't matter. //Apavitraḥ pavitraḥ vā sarvāvasthām.// In any condition of life, it doesn't matter. Pure or impure, there are two conditions. Someone is impure, someone is pure. So either way, //namo apavitraḥ pavitro, sarvāvasthām,// in any condition, //yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣam.// Anyone who remembers //puṇḍarīkākṣam,// means Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa... //Yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa,// that person, //bahyābhyantaraṁ śuciḥ,// he immediately becomes clean inside and outside. //Śuciḥ, śuciḥ// means clean or //śuciḥ// means //brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa// means clean. You have got all threads, so you should always prove that you are always clean. //Bahyābhyantaraṁ śuciḥ. Śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu.// So this is remembering Viṣṇu. So simply by remembering Viṣṇu, if one becomes clean inside and outside, so by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, how much purified he is becoming in every moment or every second. It is so nice. There is no question if we always keep ourselves chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, so there is no chance of being contaminated by the influence of //māyā.// It is so nice.

Now you chant, I'll say, you repeat. [chants prayers for fire sacrifices, devotees respond] Thank you. Chant you Hare Kṛṣṇa. Right hand, not left hand. Keep forward your right hand. Yes. [Prabhupāda chants //japa//] So you have seen how I'm chanting? You'll begin from this bigger one. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Then take another, in this way, come to this end, again begin from here, come to this end. In this way, chant sixteen rounds at least. At least. [break] ...principles of restriction. The more you follow the restriction, the more you become advanced. These things are required. And you try to avoid ten kinds of offenses. That offenses? The paper is not there? The ten kinds of offenses.

**Guest:**
//Easy Journey to Other Planets.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Other planets? Offenses, ten kinds of offenses to be avoided. You have got that?

**Haṁsadūta:**
We will give her a list.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. So the first offense is //satāṁ-nindā.// No devotee shall be blasphemed. //Satāṁ-nindaṁ śruti-śāstra-nindanam,// no scriptures should be defiled. //Satāṁ-nindaṁ śruti-śāstra-nindanam tathārtha-vādo hari-nāmni kalpanam.// And never make any interpretation. Just like we are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, somebody may make interpretation. There is no interpretation. The direct meaning is that we are praying Kṛṣṇa and His energy to accept me in the society of His service. This is the simple... There is no other interpretation. Or //artha-vādaḥ.// And //sāmya-śubha-kriyā-pramādaḥ,// one should not accept chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa with some, something //śubha-kriyā.// Just like generally the materialist persons, they go to churches or temple just to become purified of their sinful activities. Just like in Christian religion it is the custom, what is called? Confession. So we should not [be] like that. It is not confession. Confession means I confess that I have done this sinful act, and as soon as I come out from the church I do it again. No. We should know that all sinful activities are washed off by chanting, but that does not mean we shall commit it again. Whatever we have done, that is washed off. Now we should be careful. And that four principles---no illicit sex life, no meat-eating, and no gambling, no intoxication---you try and follow. You must follow. As you are taking this //mantra,// you must now follow. Whatever is done is done. Finished. And we, we allow marriage. So there is no restriction. One can marry. But no illicit sex. So these four principles should be followed, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and be pleased. Be more beautiful within and without. You are beautiful girl, so... You are all beautiful. So become beautiful within also. Kṛṣṇa will accept. Kṛṣṇa can accept any number of beautiful girls. [laughs] Unlimitedly. Just see. //Lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānam// [Bs. 5.29]. Lakṣmī. The beautiful girls are called goddess of fortune. Actually, woman is considered as goddess of fortune, representative of goddess of fortune. We are misusing for sense gratification. No. They should be respected as goddess of fortune. If one man has got nice wife, actually he has got goddess of fortune. That is astrological calculation. A man is considered to be fortunate in three ways. If he has got good wife then he is fortunate. If he has got good son then he is fortunate. And if he has got plenty money he is fortunate. So these three standards of fortune, out of which, one who has got good wife, he is the most fortunate. So our society will try to make good wives so that the boys, all boys, should, can think himself always fortunate. If one has got good wife, any place, doesn't matter. Either under... Just like Lord Śiva, he was living underneath the tree. There is no shelter, but he had the good wife, Pārvatī, so he was happy. So whenever you like, we shall select any //brahmacārī.// But don't have illicit sex. Marriage is allowed. I take personally care of marriage. I want this society must be cleansed. Without being cleansed, nobody can advance in spiritual consciousness. So what is your name?

**Devotee:**
Wendy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Your present name? What is that? Wendy. So is there any name Rukmiṇī in our list?

**Devotees:**
Oh! [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
So you may be called Rukmiṇī devī. And some day you may be kidnapped by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa kidnapped Rukmiṇī. Rukmiṇī was very beautiful, qualified, Lakṣmī. So his [her] father liked that Rukmiṇī should be given to Kṛṣṇa. And his [her] brother liked that she should be handed over to another boy. So Rukmiṇī sent one letter to Kṛṣṇa, that "Although I've not seen You, but I've heard of Your activities. So I am attached to You. Now some nonsense is coming to marry me." [break] Just see, how nice it is [laughs]. And we eat Kṛṣṇa //prasāda,// we enjoy the Kṛṣṇa. What is this nonsense, //ahaṁ brahman,// Brahman? "I am stone." What is the difference? If somebody thinks, "I am stone," and if somebody says, "I am Brahman. I am void," so what is the difference between stone and void? The same thing. Why should we become stone and wood? We shall, we should reciprocate loving affairs with Kṛṣṇa. Mādhavī-latā? How many pictures you have done? You have seen Mādhavī-latā's picture? That picture is painted by Mādhavī-latā. Yes, she is good painter. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Why you have stopped? Yes, always chant. Chant loudly. [fire sacrifice continues] All bow down. [devotees offer obeisances] Now chant. "Govinda Jaya Jaya." Chant. Chant and dance. [Prabhupāda leads //kīrtana//] [//prema-dhvanī//]

**Devotee:**
Will you always be our spiritual master?

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't follow. What do you say?

**Devotee:**
Will you be our spiritual master for eternity?

**Prabhupāda:**
I think so. [laughs] Whatever we do here, it is for eternity because it is not on the material stages. It is all on the spiritual platform. There is a song by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, //cakhu-dān dilo yei janme janme pitā sei:// "One who has opened the eyes, he is, birth after birth, he is my father."

**Devotee:**
Oh, that is... Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Cakhu-dān dilo yei. Cakhu-dān// means one who has opened the eyes, that is spiritual master. //Janme janme pitā sei. Janme janme// means birth after birth, he is my father. All right, distribute //prasādam.// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Oh, the whole thing? [laughs] All right. Give him. [devotees chanting //japa//] [break] You are not taking? Take more. Oh, where is Mādhavī-latā? Why you are in the back side? Come on, take more. Come here. You are not taking more? Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes.

**Yamunā:**
Rukmiṇī devī gave that to you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Very good. What is this?

**Yamunā:**
It's a shawl for around your neck in the cold weather.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Yamunā:**
She made it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. Very nice. Thank you.

**Rukmiṇī:**
I'll give it to Govinda dāsī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Govinda... [break] [end]
