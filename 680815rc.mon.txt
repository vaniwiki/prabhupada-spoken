[After kirtan devotees chanting japa in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
Your child is very nice. It does not cry. [laughter] Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. So your starting is very nice.

**Śyāmasundara:**
What?

**Prabhupāda:**
Your starting London //yātrā// is very nice, beginning. Now you practice, all.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Together?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, every morning, and just make systematic so that it becomes very nice. And at least twelve heads. So you are husband wife. How many pairs? Six? Or five? Come. And you are also going? Eh? London? I ask you, Annapūrṇa.

**Annapūrṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? You want to go with them or you want to go separately?

**Child:**
I would like to go with Annapūrṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That's all right. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [devotees chant //japa//] All right. Oh, it is too little. The plate is not yet full. Give me one spoon. Himāvatī?

**Himāvatī:**
Yes?

**Prabhupāda:**
You can give two //rabris// [milk sweet].

**Haṁsadūta:**
Can I put some on here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, why not? //Halavā// is very nice. Who has prepared? Oh. [end]
