**Prabhupāda:**
And where is that boy, Hṛṣīkeśa?

**Devotee:**
Hṛṣīkeśa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Come on. Oh, he has shaved his face. Very nice. Sit down. [break] Today we have got two functions. One function is initiation of a //brahmacārī,// and another function is marriage ceremony of our one disciple Satsvarūpa brahmacārī and Jadurāṇī brahmacāriṇī. [break] //...Caitanya-bhāgavata// there is a verse which says, //gṛhe vā vanete thāke, hā gaurāṅga bole ḍāke.// The purport is that either if you remain in household life or you remain as mendicant in the forest, in either case, you just become a devotee of Lord Caitanya. So although we have four divisions of the social orders, namely the //brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,// and //sannyāsa... Brahmacārī// means student, strictly observing life of celibacy, following the rules and regulations enunciated by the spiritual master under strict discipline. That is called //brahmacārī.// And next is that if a //brahmacārī// wants to get himself married, that is allowed. So when a //brahmacārī// is married, he is called //gṛhastha,// or householder. But because a //brahmacārī// is trained from the very beginning of his life renunciation of material enjoyment, he cannot be absorbed like ordinary man in family life. Ordinary man, they cannot give up the family life or association of woman even up to the end of life. But according to Vedic system, association of woman is allowed only for a certain period, during the youthful days only, just to beget nice children. Because from the age of twenty-five years old up to fifty years, one can beget nice children. //Gṛhastha// life, householder life, is meant for begetting nice children. If there are Kṛṣṇa conscious children in the society, there will be no disturbance. According to Vedic system, the population is divided into two divisions. Illegitimate sons are called //varṇa-saṅkara.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that when the population becomes //varṇa-saṅkara,// the whole social situation becomes hellish. Actually that is the fact. So one should be very careful to beget nice children so that society, social order, political order will be calm, quiet, peaceful. That is the idea of //gṛhastha// life. And many devotees... There are twelve selected personalities who are considered to be the authority of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Out of twelve authorities, seven authorities were all //gṛhasthas,// householders. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's associates, Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu, Gadādhara, and Śrīvāsa, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself, they were all householders. So it is not that simply //sannyāsī// or //brahmacārī// can realize Kṛṣṇa consciousness and not the householders. No.

So in our association we welcome this sort of marriage between trained //brahmacārī// and //brahmacāriṇī// so that we can welcome nice children for future Kṛṣṇa conscious generation. That is our viewpoint. So... And initiation... Initiation means to begin spiritual life. According to Vedic culture, there are two births. One birth is from the //gṛhastha// parents, father and mother, and the other birth is between the spiritual master and //Vedas.// The Vedic knowledge is considered mother, and the spiritual master is considered the father. And by the help of the spiritual master, when one gets into transcendental knowledge, that is called second birth. So //janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ:// "Everyone is born //śūdra.//" //Śūdra// means without any culture. They are called //śūdras.// According to Vedic scriptures, there are four classes of men: //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas// and //śūdras.// Out of these four classes of social order, the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas// and //vaiśyas// are considered higher caste. //Brāhmaṇas// means the most intelligent class of men in the society, and //kṣatriya// means the administrative class of men, and //vaiśyas// means the mercantile class of men, and //śūdras// means the laborer class of men. That division is everywhere, not only in India. These four classes of men are present in every country, every society. It may be in different names only, but the four divisions are already there everywhere. It cannot be without it. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. These four classes of divisions are there according to different qualities, and Kṛṣṇa says, or God says, "That is My creation." So there cannot be any exception of His creation. Just like God's creation is sun. In every country there is sun, not that the sun can be seen in India. In every country there is moon. Similarly, this caste system is present in every country, in every society, but it may be called in different names. So the //śūdras// means the lowest class of men, who have no culture, but the higher classes, the //brāhmaṇas,// the //kṣatriyas,// they are considered highly cultured. And how they are called highly cultured? Because they are twice-born. First birth, //janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ. Saṁskārāt,// by following this ritualistic ceremony of initiation or marriage, they are called //dvija,// twice-born. //Saṁskārād bhaved dvijo veda-pāthād bhaved vipraḥ.// This initiation means this boy is being accepted as initiated in order to give him Vedic instruction so that he may live as a student, as a //brahmacārī,// within the society and get complete instruction of Vedic knowledge. And when he is competent, he is called //vipra. Veda-pāthād bhaved vipro brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.// And when he realizes the Supreme Self, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he will be called //brāhmaṇa.// At that time we offer thread ceremony.

So this process are there, we are observing, and our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is gradually making progress with these principles. We have got already eleven branches, and one of our principal students, Śrīman Hayagrīva Brahmacārī and Kīrtanānanda Swami, they are attempting to open a new social community project in West Virginia, New Vrindaban. So this Kṛṣṇa conscious movement is taking ground gradually, and we hope in future these //gṛhasthas,// these householders, //vānaprasthas, sannyāsīs,// they will implement this Vedic culture gradually, and people will be more and more happy. Thank you very much.

So one thing I forgot is the sacred thread ceremony for Hayagrīva. He is present. Is there any? I think in my bag there is a thread, so Hayagrīva can also. Oh, here. You have that //mantra?//

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ?// And one thread? Bring. Hayagrīva?

**Devotees:**
Hayagrīva? Hayagrīva.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, where is water? These garlands may be first of all put here, then one to the bridegroom and to the... [break] [//oṁ apavitraḥ// recitation] Again do that. Yes, chant. Those who are initiated, chant, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma... I forgot to say you about the thread ceremony. Those who have passed one year's chanting, they can be offered this sacred thread. [break] ...first of all. Everyone has done? [//ācamana//] You have done second time. You have done second time? Then you do second time, you. Hṛṣīkeśa.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
They have done it twice, all of them.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have done now? Oh. [//oṁ apavitraḥ// recitation] Yes. Do it for the third time, circle. [//oṁ apavitraḥ// recitation, followed by //maṅgalācaraṇa// and other prayers] Now... Yes. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [all chanting //japa//] You have... You can sit down. You are going? She is going? Your mother is going? Call her. Now we shall, function. Please sit down. [break] Come to this end, 108, then begin from here, again come to this side. In this way at least sixteen rounds you chant. And your spiritual name is already Hṛṣīkeśa. That's all right. And further instruction you'll have from Kīrtanānanda Swami and your Godbrother. So chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Oh, is that, that...?

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] neck beads.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now Judy's mother, you can come here, Judy's mother.

**Jadurāṇī:**
She can sit on the chair.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That's all right. Give her chair here.

**Jadurāṇī:**
Oh, all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sit down there. You sit down. Satsvarūpa, you sit down, this...

**Satsvarūpa:**
Sit down here.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Yes. Sit down. Sit down there. Now your daughter is being married with this //brahmacārī.// Now you can offer this //brahmacārī//---his name is Satsvarūpa---that "This girl was in my charge so long. I give this daughter to you in charity to take charge." You tell like that.

**Jadurāṇī's mother:**
I've had this daughter with me for so long. I now give her in your charge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And you say, "Yes, I take charge."

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. I take charge.

**Jadurāṇī's mother:**
Then take here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you say that "Jadurāṇī, I take charge of your life so long I shall live," in this way.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Jadurāṇī, I take charge of your life so long I shall live.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you say that "I shall render my services unto you throughout my life. Throughout my life." Yes.

**Jadurāṇī:**
I shall render my service to you throughout my life.

**Prabhupāda:**
And there is no separation. It is... There is no question of divorce or separation. In any condition of life, happiness or distress, you shall continue as husband and wife, because our main business is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This marriage is not material marriage for sense gratification. But because there are girls and boys and we require also Kṛṣṇa conscious population, therefore we encourage this marriage. It is not for sense gratification. So in this way there is no question of separation or divorce. You admit this? Yes. You also admit this? Then you change your garland.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now you come this side; you come this side. Yes. And there is red, red //sindhu?// No? Red //sindhu?// No?

**Brahmānanda:**
There is a ring.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is a ring? All right. Give her this ring and now just cover the head. You cover. You cover the head. And somebody stuck up this, his cloth and his [her] cloth. Knot. Make a knot. You make. Yes. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Now chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Godbrothers and sister, give them good wishes.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol! Haribol!// All glories to Satsvarūpa and Jadurāṇī! Hare Kṛṣṇa!

**Prabhupāda:**
Now chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [chants] Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Boston center is in your charge, husband and wife. So you have to develop. You do it, and your children will do it. In this way just engage fully, heart and soul, in Kṛṣṇa's service. Oh, this is mixed?

**Brahmānanda:**
No, it's not.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bring that. Mix it. Mix it. Yes, mix it. [//oṁ apavitraḥ// recitation-fire sacrifice] Offer. //Svāhā.// Take. Everyone, you also take, little, little, some. //Vande aham...// [recites //maṅgalācaraṇa// and prayers again, with devotees repeating] Now take one banana. Give him one. Yes, you take one. He'll give. Hayagrīva. Give Hayagrīva one. Give me one. Yes. Now turn[?] down. Yes. [chants //namo brahmaṇya-devāya// prayer three times] Just put slowly. [chants Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// responsively with devotees two times] Now bow down.

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine

[devotees offer obeisances] Chant //govinda jaya jaya, gopāla jaya jaya.// [//kīrtana//-Prabhupāda recites //Gāyatrī// to Hayagrīva during //kīrtana//] [//prema-dhvanī// by Śrīla Prabhupāda] All glories to the married couples. Now distribute //prasāda.// [break] ...in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness every function is happy?

**Devotees:**

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa is there, reservoir of all pleasure. Why it should not be happy? Everything should be happy. Where is your spot, black?

**Hṛṣīkeśa:**
Oh, he didn't give it to me yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Somebody may take these bananas, cut into pieces and distribute. [end]
