**Prabhupāda:**
One has to accept the renounced order from another person who is in renounced order. So I never thought that I shall accept this renounced order of life. In my family life, when I was in the midst of my wife and children, sometimes I was dreaming my spiritual master, that he's calling me, and I was following him. When my dream was over, I was thinking. I was little horrified. "Oh, Guru Mahārāja wants me to become //sannyāsī.// How can I accept //sannyāsa?//" At that time, I was feeling not very satisfaction that I have to give up my family and have to become a mendicant. At that time, it was a horrible feeling. Sometimes I was thinking, "No, I cannot take //sannyāsa.//" But again I saw the same dream. So in this way I was fortunate. My Guru Mahārāja [Prabhupāda begins to cry, choked voice] pulled me out from this material life. I have not lost anything. He was so kind upon me. I have gained. I left three children, I have got now three hundred children. So I am not loser. This is material conception. We think that we shall be loser by accepting Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is loser. I say from my practical experience. I was thinking that "How can I accept this renounced order of life? I cannot accept so much trouble." So... But I retired from my family life. I was sitting alone in Vṛndāvana, writing books. So this, my Godbrother, he insisted me, "Bhaktivedanta //prabhu...//" This title was given in my family life. It was offered to me by the Vaiṣṇava society. So he insisted me. Not he insisted me. Practically my spiritual master insisted me //through// him, that "You accept." Because without accepting the renounced order of life, nobody can become a preacher. So he wanted me to become a preacher. So he forced me through this Godbrother, "You accept." So unwillingly I accepted. And then I remembered that he wanted me to go to the Western country. So I am feeling now very much obliged to my, this Godbrother, that he carried out the wish of my spiritual master and enforced me to accept this //sannyāsa// order.

So this Godbrother, His Holiness Keśava Mahārāja, is no more. He has entered Kṛṣṇa's abode. So I wish to pass a resolution of bereavement and send them. So... And I have composed one verse also in this connection in Sanskrit. So you all present, you sign this. I shall send it tomorrow. The verse I have composed, it is in Sanskrit. //Vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness is //vairāgya-vidyā. Vairāgya-vidyā// means to become detestful to this material world. That is called //vairāgya-vidya.// And that is possible simply by this //bhakti-yoga. Vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam apāyayan mām.// So this... Just like medicine. The child is afraid of taking medicine. That also I have experienced. In my childhood, when I became ill, I was very stubborn. I won't accept any medicine. So my mother used to force medicine within my mouth with a spoon. I was so obstinate. So anyway, similarly, I did not want to accept this //sannyāsa// order, but this Godbrother forced me. "You must." //Apāyayan mām,// he forcefully made me to drink this medicine. //Anabhīpsu andham.// Why I was unwilling? //Anabhīpsu// means unwilling. //Andham, andham// means one who is blind, who cannot see his future. The spiritual life is the brightest future, but the materialists cannot see to it. You see? But the Vaiṣṇavas, the spiritual master, they forcefully, "You drink this medicine." You see. //Apāyayan mām anabhīpsu andhām śrī-keśava-bhakti-prajñāna-nāma.// So this my Godbrother, his name is Keśava, Bhaktiprajñāna Keśava. //Kṛpāmbudhi.// So he did this favor upon me because he was ocean of mercy. So we offer our obeisances to Vaiṣṇava, //kṛpāmbudhi. Vāñchā-kalpa-tarubhyaś ca kṛpā-sindhubhya eva ca.// The Vaiṣṇavas, the representatives of the Lord, they are so kind. They bring the ocean of mercy for distributing to the suffering humanity. //Kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. So I am offering my respectful obeisances unto this His Holiness, because he forcefully made me adopt this //sannyāsa// order. So he is no more in this world. He has entered Kṛṣṇa's abode. So I am offering my respectful obeisances along with my disciples. On the first day of my //sannyāsa,// I never thought, but I remembered that I'll have to speak in English. So I remember on that //sannyāsa// day, when there was a reception, so I, first of all, I spoke in English. So it is all arrangement of Kṛṣṇa, higher authority. We are writing like this, "Resolved that we the undersigned members and devotees of International Society for Krishna Consciousness Incorporated, in a condolence meeting under the presidency of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, today the 21st of October, 1968, at our Seattle branch, express our profound bereavement on hearing the passing of His Divine Grace Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktiprajñāna Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja, the //sannyāsa// guru, preceptor of our spiritual master, and on October 6th, 1968, at his headquarter residence in Nabadwip, West Bengal. We offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Śrī Śrīmad B. P. Keśava Gosvāmī Mahārāja with the following verse composed on this occasion by our spiritual master." This verse I have already explained to you. So I wish that you all sign this and I'll send it tomorrow by air mail. Have you got pencil?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes. [sound of Prabhupāda signing] [end]
