> [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]

The same subject matter, that those who are too much attached in the family affairs, //gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām. Gṛhamedhī// means one who has made his center of activity home. He is called //gṛhamedhī.// There are two words. One word is //gṛhastha,// and one word is //gṛhamedhī.// What is the significance of these two words? //Gṛhastha// means one... Not only //gṛhastha.// It is called //gṛhastha-āśrama.// Whenever we speak of //āśrama,// it has got spiritual relationship. So all these four divisions of social orders-//brahmacārī-āśrama, gṛhastha-āśrama, vānaprastha-āśrama, sannyāsa-āśrama... Āśrama. Āśrama// means... Whenever... //Āśrama,// this word, has become little popular in your country also. //Āśrama// means situation for spiritual cultivation. Generally, we mean that. And here also, there are so many //yoga-āśrama.// I have seen in New York so many //āśramas.// "New York Yoga Āśrama," "Yoga Society," like that. //Āśrama// means it has got a spiritual connection. It doesn't matter whether a man... //Gṛhastha// means living with family, wife and children.

So to remain with family and children is no disqualification for spiritual advancement of life. That is not a disqualification because after all, one has to take his birth from the father and mother. So all great //ācāryas,// great spiritual leaders, after all, they have come from father and mother. So without combination of father and mother, even there is no possibility of begetting a great soul. There are many instances of great souls like Śaṅkarācārya, Lord Jesus Christ, Rāmānujācārya. Even they had no very high hereditary title, still, they came out from the //gṛhasthas,// father and mother. So //gṛhastha,// or the householder life, is not disqualification. We should not think it, that only the //brahmacārīs// or the //sannyāsīs,// they can elevate to the spiritual platform, whereas those who are living with wife and children, they cannot. No. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has clearly stated in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// that

> kibā vipra, kibā nyāsī, śūdra kene naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei 'guru' haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]

Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "It doesn't matter whether a person is //gṛhastha// or a //sannyāsī// or a //brāhmaṇa// or not //brāhmaṇa.// It doesn't matter. Simply if one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, if he is elevated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he is just, I mean to say, eligible to become the spiritual master." //Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]. //Tattva-vettā// means one who knows about the science of Kṛṣṇa. That means fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. //Sei guru haya. Sei// means "he." //Guru// means "spiritual master." He doesn't say that "One has to become a //sannyāsī// or a //brahmacārī.// Then he can..." No. But here the word is used, //gṛhamedhī,// not //gṛhastha. Gṛhastha// is not condemned. If one lives in regulative principle with wife and children, so that is not disqualification. But //gṛhamedhī, gṛhamedhī// means he has no higher ideas or higher understanding of spiritual life. Simply living with wife and children like cats and dogs, he is called //gṛhamedhī.// That is the difference between these two words, //gṛhamedhī// and //gṛhastha.//

So Śukadeva Gosvāmī said that //gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām.// "One who does not know anything about this family life or sex life"---family life, they have taken it as sex life, that's all---"so they have many things to hear." //Śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. Actually, you see. People are reading so many newspapers. In big country, big cities, there are big, big volumes of newspaper, magazines. They are very much eager to learn or to hear about the current news. So hearing means //śrotavyādi.// There are volumes of volumes literature, magazines, newspaper. They are hearing. But when you say, "Please come here. We are reciting //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Please hear," they will not come. They will not come. This minus. When you speak of God, then they are not ready to hear. But if you speak of dog, that "Here is a dog's medicine. You can maintain a dog like this, and a dog can become fatty like this," oh, it is very scientific matter. You see? So they are called //gṛhamedhīs.// So they have got many subject matter to hear, but they are not agreeable to hear only one thing---about God.

Why? Now, //apaśyatām ātma-tattvam:// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]] "They do not know what is self-realization." //Apaśyatām,// cannot see. Their vision is very poor. Why? They are thinking this body as self; therefore they are very poorly thoughtful. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in another place, it is stated, //yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13]. Every day we are experiencing that "I am not this body. The body is growing. I am still there." There are so many instances. But we cannot understand that we are not this body. //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. //Ātmā// means, the //ātmā...// There are various meanings of //ātmā. Ātmā// sometimes is meant, indicating this body, //ātmā// is sometimes indicating this mind, //ātmā// is soul, and //ātmā,// Paramātmā, the Supreme Lord. //Ātma-tattvam. Tattvam// means truth, philosophy, or science. So they do not know the science of //ātmā,// either take it body or mind. Generally, they take it as this body. So so far body is concerned, there are so many departments: medical department and health department and... I do not remember. There are so many departments. All these departments of knowledge, they are practically on the basis of this body. Then higher than this, //ātmā,// if you take it, "mind," there are psychological department, speculation department, philosophical department, so many departments, mind. Then intellectual department. But there is no department of the //ātmā,// of the soul. That is the defect of the modern civilization. Therefore //Bhāgavata// says, //apaśyatām ātma-tattvam:// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]] "They have no information of the real //ātmā,// of the real position, real background of all these activities. They do not see it." Therefore they have got many subject matter to hear about this body, about this mind, about intellectual activities, and so many things. But because they do not know that //ātmā// means the self, they do not know, therefore they have got many subject matter except this one---the soul, the subject matter of soul. //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]].

And why they are so much ignorant? "Because they have made home as the center of activities. They do not know; neither they are educated. It is not their fault. The system of education is faulty. They do not give any education about the //ātma-tattvam.// They give education that, about economic development, about technological understanding, about scientific understanding of the laws of nature, and so many other things, but there is no department of knowledge to understand what is soul. //Apaśyatām.// Because they do not see, they do not know, therefore they are too much attached to this body, and this body means home. And home means wife. Wife means children. Children means money. Money means society, so many things. Yes.

//Ataḥ gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. First thing is that this material world is existing on sex attraction. And as soon as there is combination of sex, then the next attraction is for home, for land, for children, for society, for wealth, for bank balance, and so many things. Then extend it more, society to nationality, nationality, humanity, and go on increasing, but they are not //ātma-tattvam.// They are all //gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām,// extended selfishness. Selfishness... Just like a dog. He knows simply about his body. He won't allow another dog to come in his boundary. That is very poor selfishness. You extend it little more, human society. There is family, wife, children. That is also extended selfishness. Then you further extend it. You have got society or nationality, consciousness of nationality. That is also still further extended selfishness. Similarly, you extend the same propensity humanity-wise. Because we are...

There is a class of men. They are very much anxious to serve the human society. But they are not anxious to serve the animal society. The animal society may be killed for the satisfaction of the human society. Therefore, unless you come to the point of //ātmā,// whatever extended selfishness there is, it is selfishness. There is no, I mean to say, broadmindedness. And broadmindedness, when you come to the platform of //ātmā. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. When you come to the point of God, then you see, "Oh, everything belongs to God. Everything belongs to God. Here is an animal. Here is an animal. He also as good as I am because he is also soul." So //ātma-tattvam// to be discussed, but they are not prepared. Therefore //gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām.// So what is their business, those who are blind to the //ātma-tattvam?// So that business is described in the next verse.

> nidrayā hriyate naktaṁ
> vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ
> divā cārthehayā rājan
> kuṭumba-bharaṇena vā
> [[books:sb:2:1:3|[SB 2.1.3]]]

So their business is very nicely explained. What is that? //Nidrayā,// sleeping. Sleeping. //Hriyate.// They waste their life by sleeping. When? At night. //Nidrayā hriyate naktam.// Or they waste their time in sex life. At night there are two things. One who has no advantage of sex life, he sleeps alone. And if he has got advantage of sex life, he enjoys. So at night they waste their life in this way. //Nidrayā hriyate naktaṁ vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:3|[SB 2.1.3]]]. In this way their life is being wasted. And at daytime? Now, //divā cārthehayā rājan.// At the daytime, simply "Where is money? Where is money?" //Artha. Artha// means... Because to maintain this body we require money. //Divā cārthehayā rājan.// All right, if one gets money, then next? //Kuṭumba-bharaṇena vā.// Then shopping. As soon as you get money then shopping, the wife's bill. Yes. So in this way, day and night, they are simply under the impression of this bodily conception of life. Why they are doing that?

> dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣv
> ātma-sainyeṣv asatsv api
> teṣāṁ pramatto nidhanaṁ
> paśyann api na paśyati
> [[books:sb:2:1:4|[SB 2.1.4]]]

They are attached because they are attached to this body, therefore attached to the children. //Dehāpatya. Apatya// means children. And //kalatra. Kalatra// means wife. //Dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣu ātma-sainyeṣu.// This very word //sainya... Sainya// means soldier. Here in the material world, every one of us is struggling very hard. That is a fact. Everyone knows. So when we struggle, when we fight, then we must have soldiers. Without soldiers, nobody fights. So they are our soldiers: this body... Everyone wants to keep this body fit. And maintaining the children and the wife... //Dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣu.// We are thinking that "My, this body and wife and children and home and country and society will save me." I am struggling against... What is that struggling? I do not wish to die. I do not wish to be diseased. I do not wish to become old man. //Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. I don't wish to get birth again, or I want to stop birth. //Janma-mṛtyu.// I want to stop death. I want to stop disease. And I want to stop old age. These are the activities, material activities, struggling against. And I am thinking that "These soldiers, or this, my body, or my wife, my children, will protect me," //dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣv ātma-sainyeṣv asatsv api// [[books:sb:2:1:4|[SB 2.1.4]]], although I am experiencing every day that they are //asat,// they will not exist. How do I know they will not exist? My father has died. My elderly, my mother has died, my grandfather has died. Therefore I will also die. And my next generation, he will also die. My wife also will die. So everybody will die. //Asatsv api.// They know by experience that they will not exist, but still, their business has become to struggle for existence. //Dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣu.// These are very important subject matter. Try to understand. We know that nobody will exist. I want to exist. That is my intention. I do not wish to die. I want to exist, but I know also that all these, my soldiers, including my, this stout and strong body, it will also not exist. //Dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣu, teṣāṁ pramattaḥ.//

//Pramatta// means crazy, mad. //Pramatto nidhanam,// distraction. //Nidhanam paśyan. Paśyan// means although he is seeing every day, every moment. Just like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was quested by Yamarāja, "What is the most wonderful thing in this world? Can you say?" Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira immediately replied. What is that? //Ahany ahani bhūtāni gacchantīha yamālayam:// "Every moment, every second, every day, every night, there are so many hundreds and thousands of living entities, they are going to the temple of death, or dying." //Ahany ahani bhūtāni gacchantīha yamālayaṁ śeṣāḥ sthāvaram icchanti.// "But one who is living, he is thinking that 'I will not die. I will live for good.' That is the most wonderful thing in this world." Nobody is taking experience that "I will have to meet death. And what is next after death? What I was before my birth? Why I am here? Why I am struggling so hard? I want to be happy. I want to be peaceful. Why there is no peace? Why there is no happiness? Why these things? Why I am put into this...?" These are called //ātma-tattvam.// These are called //brahma-jijñāsā.// If a man is not enlightened to this point of inquiring of this, "What? What I am? Wherefore I am come? What is this world? What is this body? Why I am getting old? Why I am getting diseased?" So many "whys" there are. This is called //brahma-jijñāsā.// But they are //pramatta,// they are mad after the struggle for existence, although they know nothing will exist, it has come just like a flash, and it will end like a flash. Then what is the actual platform of my life, my living condition? They do not inquire. They do not inquire.

So //gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām. Dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣv ātma-sainyeṣv asatsv api, teṣāṁ pramatto nidhanam// [[books:sb:2:1:4|[SB 2.1.4]]]. Everyone is seeing that it will destroy. Suppose if you know... Suppose you are constructing a very nice skyscraper building, but if you know... Somebody says that tomorrow the whole city will merge into the Atlantic Ocean. Would you like to construct such building? No. I am giving that one example, but it is a fact that the struggle for existence for living, but living condition will not be allowed. Then the next question should be that "Why this is happening? We are, everyone is struggling for existing, but existence, there is no... I will not exist. Nobody will exist." This question, unless there is in the human mind, then, //Bhāgavata// says, //parābhavas tāvat:// "His all activities are simply defeat." //Yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam.// So //ātma-tattvam.// One should be inquisitive to understand, "What is my constitutional position?" Then it is perfect life. Otherwise it is crazy life. We may try to live by so much hard struggle of life, but we cannot exist. We can exist only when we understand "What I am." This is diagnosis. If I know that what is my actual need, if I know what is my actual position, if I know that wherefrom I have come and where I have to go, all these informations, if we are fully informed, that is perfection of life. Otherwise it is simply defeat, whatever we may do here. //Apaśyatām. Teṣāṁ pramatto nidhanaṁ paśyann api na paśyati.//

> tasmād bhārata sarvātmā
> bhagavān īśvaro hariḥ
> śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaś ca
> smartavyaś cecchatābhayam
> [[books:sb:2:1:5|[SB 2.1.5]]]

Now he is concluding that "Don't be misled by so many subject matter of hearing. Just concentrate upon hearing Kṛṣṇa consciousness." //Tasmāt. Tasmāt,// "Therefore," //tasmād bhārata,// "O descendant of Bhārata..." //Sarvātmā. Sarvātmā// means the all-pervading Supersoul; //bhagavān,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead; //īśvara,// the supreme controller; //hariḥ,// who can, I mean to say, protect, who can take away all your miseries, who can protect you from all miseries. //Tasmād bhārata sarvātmā bhagavān hariḥ, īśvaro hariḥ, śrotavyaḥ:// "You have to hear about Him." Instead of hearing so many other news, which will not exist, you just try to hear about Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because Parīkṣit Mahārāja's question was that "Now I am going to die. What shall I hear about?" Because hearing is our main business. You are hearing. If you go out from this temple you will also hear. Or the sound is always going on. If we do not want to hear, the hearing is going on. So here it is recommended that "That Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the supreme controller, who is Hari, or who protects us from all difficulty, Hari, and //sarvātmā//---He is situated in everyone's heart---that Supreme Personality of Godhead, Supersoul, should be heard." //Śrotavya,// should be heard. We should be prepared to hear about Him. //Śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaś ca.// And we should discuss about Him, //kīrtitavyaś ca. Smartavya.// And if we hear and discuss, then, if we are really serious, then we shall remember also. //Smartavya,// and //smartavyaś cecchatābhayam.// Those who are actually desiring //abhayam...//

//Abhayam// means fearlessness. So long we are not connected in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or not connected with the Supreme Lord, we shall always be fearful. Fearful is one of the qualification of the conditioned soul. //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca:// four necessities. Why we are defending? Because on account of fearfulness. The animal, a small animal, ant, it has got also fear, and the biggest nation, Russia or America, they are also fearful because this is the qualification of conditioned life: //āhāra,// eating, //nidrā,// sleeping, and fearing, and mating. So if you want to get yourself free from fearfulness, then Śukadeva Gosvāmī recommends that you have to chant and you have to hear and you have to remember about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the conclusion. Don't try to hear so many nonsense things. //Vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana// [[books:bg:2:41|[Bg. 2.41]]]. Just concentrate. If you want to hear about God, there are volumes of literature.

One political leader... Perhaps you have heard his name. His name was Madan Mohan Mallabhya.[?] In India. He came to see our Guru Mahārāja, and he inquired that "What are your activities?" So then some of our Godbrothers presented that "We have got six periodicals in six languages: one in English, one in Bengali, one in Hindu, one in Oriya, one is Assami. And we have got one paper, Bengali, daily." So this Madan Mohan Mallabhya was astonished that "You are issuing a paper daily, simply discussing about God?" So my Guru Mahārāja said, "Yes. Why not?" Then he gave him a nice example, that in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is stated that //ekāṁśena sthito jagat:// [[books:bg:10:42|[Bg. 10.42]]] This material world is only one-fourth part manifestation of God's energy. Now, apart from material... There are innumerable universes and innumerable planets in each universe. Out of that, this earthly planet is very tiny. And in this planet there are so many countries and so many cities. And each and every city there are so many periodicals, so many newspapers, and each paper having so many editions daily. So in comparison to the whole universe or whole material creation, this planet is nothing and this city is nothing. If you can produce so many news, then what about the three-fourth energy, Vaikuṇṭha?

So we can give you a minute edition of the transcendental news of the spiritual world. But unfortunately, there is no customer. There is no customer. The same thing, the //śrotavyādīni...// If you put magazines about this material world, you will get many customers. But as soon as we put forward //Back to Godhead,// we have no customer. The unfortunate thing is that nobody is interested about //ātma-tattvam.// So actually we should be interested to understand. We should be interested to understand //ātma-tattva// if we actually want to be free from fearfulness. //Icchatā abhayam. Abhayam// means fearless. If we are actually... Now, //icchatābhayam,// who are those? Transcendentalists.

So there are four classes of persons who are trying to get transcendental perfection or spiritual life. They are called //jñānī,// who are trying to understand the Absolute Truth by philosophical speculation, and yogi... Those who are trying to visualize the Supreme Soul within the heart, they are called yogi. And //jñānī,// yogi, and //bhaktas,// and the devotees. Those who are trying to leave this material world and go back to Godhead and associate with the Supreme Person. There are three classes of men. They are trying to get out of this fearful world. //Icchatābhayam.// Therefore here, //sarvātmā,// the yogis are trying to find out the Supersoul. Therefore //sarvātmā.// So //tasmād bhārata sarvātmā,// and //īśvara. Īśvara.// The //jñānīs// are trying to merge into the effulgence of //īśvara,// or the yogis are trying to find out the Supersoul. Therefore //sarvātmā.// So //tasmād bhārata sarvātmā,// and //īśvara. Īśvara.// The //jñānīs// are trying to merge into the effulgence of //īśvara,// or the yogis are trying to find out the //īśvara,// the supreme controller. And the //jñānīs// are trying to find out the impersonal Brahman. And Hari, and Bhagavān, the Personality of Godhead, Hari, or Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu, the devotees, persons who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are trying to find out.

So either of them, their aim is how to get out of this fearful material existence. So Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, concludes, that //icchatā abhayam. Abhayam// means fearful. If you actually want to be free from fear, then you should concentrate your mind, discussing, hearing, remembering, either of the impersonal Brahman... //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. Either you think of Brahman or Paramātmā or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but your subject matter should be this: hearing, chanting, discussing, talking, knowing. Don't divert your attention to this flimsy, I mean to say, so-called subject matter which will end. Because everything, whatever we are discussing in the material world, everything will end, nothing will exist, we should concentrate our mind on the subject matter which will exist. Because I am soul, I am ever-existing, eternal, my business is, therefore, "What is my eternal engagement?" This subject matter is proposed by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, and we shall discuss later on, in the next meeting. Thank you very much. Any question?

**Guest:**
What were your activities after your initiation? What were your activities after initiation?

**Prabhupāda:**
Initiation means beginning or spiritual activities. Initiation means just to begin.

**Guest:**
What were your activities after that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't you see what are our activities? Is it very secret? You can see what are our activities. We are discussing about Kṛṣṇa. We are talking about Kṛṣṇa. We are chanting about Kṛṣṇa. We are eating about Kṛṣṇa. We are typewriting about Kṛṣṇa. We are dictaphoning about Kṛṣṇa. Don't you see it? Then? Everything engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness---that is our activity. The same thing will be there; nothing will be changed. Here we are staying in also big apartment and the down, they are also staying in the similar apartment. But this is called temple, and that is called factory. Why? Here the consciousness is different from the consciousness down. That's all. Nothing has to be changed. Simply the rubberstamp has to be changed. Somebody is signing, "for, on behalf of such and such," and the rubberstamp is changed. We have to change our rubberstamp on behalf of Kṛṣṇa. That's all.

...sign it. That's all. The business is the same, but little difference, little difference in this way, that we are eating and others are also eating. So so far eating is concerned there is no difference. But we are eating Kṛṣṇa //prasādam,// and they are eating sense gratification. That is the difference. We are sleeping; they are also sleeping. But we are sleeping to get energy to work more diligently and nicely for Kṛṣṇa, and they are working, taking rest for working for sense gratification. So eating, sleeping, fearing. We are also fearful in this way, that "//Māyā// may not catch me." We are always cautious. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. Because //māyā// is very strong, so we should be always fearful that "//Māyā// may not catch me." Always stick to Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet so //māyā// may not be able to touch you. Just like in a contaminated, diseased area, the doctor is also fearful, but he has got prophylactic administration. He is quite fit. He can go even in the contaminated state. Similarly, if we are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even if we are in the midst of mayic activities, it will not affect. So everything is there, but if you change your consciousness, then you are safe. //Icchatā abhayam,// no more fearfulness. That is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Pradyumna:**
Swamiji, is there such thing as mind, intelligence, and ego on the spiritual realm?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Why not? Ego... I am thinking at the present moment ego falsely. "I am somebody belonging to this material world," either I may think that "I am American," either I think "I am Indian," something of this material world. But similarly, when you think //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// "I am spirit soul," that is also //aham, ahaṅkāra.// Ego means //ahaṅkāra,// identification, self-identification, //ahaṅkāra,// "I am." Everyone has got the sense, "I am." Now, that "I am" thinking, at the present moment I am thinking in my material concept. So when I will think in spiritual concept, that is my pure ego, pure identification. So ego will remain. Ego will not vanish. This "I" consciousness will remain, but here, at the present moment, I am misidentifying myself, and when I actually know myself, that identification is pure ego.

**Haṁsadūta:**
You say the chanting cleans the dust from the mirror of the mind. What does mirror mean? How does it mean mirror? What is it reflecting?

**Prabhupāda:**
Mirror means you see so many things within your mind. Is it not a mirror, reflection? Don't you see? As you see mirror reflection of your face, but you see this body. When you will see in the mirror that you are not this body, you are something within this body, that is dustless mirror. Yes?

**Devotee (1):**
What is Balarāma's relationship with Rādhā?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not our discussion here. What you got this Balarāma's relation... [break]

**Devotee (1):**
I mean, what is Their relationship? I understand that all the expansions come through Balarāma, but...?

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right, but Balarāma has no relationship with Rādhā.

**Devotee (1):**
I mean not a friend or anything?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Who said it?

**Devotee (1):**
I was wondering.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you think like that? No. Balarāma is... Rādhā... As Kṛṣṇa has expansion, similarly, Rādhā has also expansion. So as Rādhārāṇī is directly connected with Kṛṣṇa, similarly, Rādhā's another expansion is connected with Balarāma. All Lakṣmī are connected with the..., not exactly Rādhā directly. As Kṛṣṇa expands Himself in multi-forms, similarly, Rādhā also expands Herself. That is stated in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// you will find. Yes?

**Pradyumna:**
So in terms of spiritual potency of Kṛṣṇa, and... Rādhā was...

**Prabhupāda:**
You put an unnecessary question. When I shall ask you to question the subject matter which I have discussed, you should put questions on this matter. If you bring so many other subject matter, there will be no end. Try to understand what we have spoken in this meeting. We have not spoken anything about Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Why you are bringing this question? Question means the subject matter which we have discussed, if you have got any question about that thing, you should put question. Otherwise, if you make me a dictionary, that go on questioning, there will be no end. That should not be done. Now, we have not discussed here about Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Of course, this is also relevant question, but the public will not understand. We are discussing on general subject matter. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa discussion is very confidential. You have to go to the platform first of all by understanding Kṛṣṇa. You see? //Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-tattva// is discussed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the Tenth Canto. So first of all you have to go through the nine cantos very carefully. Then you will understand. In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// you'll find, //rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktir asmād ekātmānāv api bhuvi// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. If you want to discuss about Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, that is not in the public meeting. They are very confidential subject matter. People may misunderstand what is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Generally, questions should be put on the subject matter discussed in the meeting. That should be the point. //Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-tattva// is very confidential, for higher status of understanding. Yes?

**Himavatī:**
Vyāsadeva, you say, lived with his wife and children in a cottage, and people would come and bring them foodstuff from the village. Now, the four divisions of //brahma cārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and so on, I thought that the //gṛhasthas'// duties in the //āśrama, varṇāśrama-dharma,// was to supply the other three.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Himavatī:**
How is this...? How is this connected with Vyāsadeva and his situation?

**Prabhupāda:**
Vāsudeva?

**Devotees:**
Vyāsadeva.

**Prabhupāda:**
Vyāsadeva? Vyāsadeva was a //gṛhastha.// He was a householder man. He was //brāhmaṇa.//

**Himavatī:**
But he had no luxuries.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Those who will depend on the charities and alms of the society, they are not allowed to make any luxury at the cost of others. They can simply ask help for the bare necessities of life.

**Himavatī:**
And that's permitted to the //gṛhasthas?//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Gṛhastha,// when a //brāhmaṇa// is //gṛhastha,// he shall be a teacher. //Paṭhana-pāṭhana yajana-yājana dāna-pratigraha.// Generally, the //brāhmaṇas,// those who are //gṛhasthas...// There are four //varṇas,// or division of castes. The //brāhmaṇas,// they are generally teachers, priests, and writers, philosophers. So society requires all these things, so they take up this charge. And the //kṣatriyas,// they are administrators, so they rule over the country. They exact taxes from the citizens. They live on the tax, and the //brāhmaṇas,// on the contribution of the public. Just like we are teaching, we are living on the contribution of the public. The public knows that there is an important institution. They are giving good lessons. So public contributes. So we can accept contribution. But a king is not allowed to take contribution. Because he is administrator, he can tax, so his source of income is tax. And the //brāhmaṇas'// source of income is contribution because they are rendering transcendental service. Similarly, the //vaiśyas// or the mercantile class, their means of living-trade, cow protection, and agriculture. And those who are //śūdras,// laborer class, they will serve these three higher classes, //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas,// and the //vaiśyas,// because they have no independent means. They cannot do anything, neither they are educated, nor they are king, princely order, nor they have money to do business. Therefore they have to serve.

//Paricaryātmakaṁ karma śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. //Śūdra// means they earn their livelihood by serving others. And in the Kali-yuga, in this age, ninety-nine percent or at least ninety percent, they live by serving others. Therefore it is said, //kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ:// "In the Kali, in this age, almost everyone is //śūdra.//" There is no //brāhmaṇa,// no //kṣatriya,// no //vaiśya.// Of course, there are //vaiśyas.// Factually, at the present moment the population are the //vaiśyas// and the //śūdras.// And there is fight, that your American nation, they are //vaiśyas,// and the Russians, they are //śūdras.// So there is always fight between the //vaiśyas// and //śūdras.// Actually, there is no //brāhmaṇa// or //kṣatriyas.// They are extinct. And because the //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas// are extinct, therefore social orders are in chaos. There is no brain; there is no good administration. That's all. Without //kṣatriya,// there cannot be any good administration, and without //brāhmaṇa,// there is no good brain. Therefore we pray to Kṛṣṇa, //namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca, kṛṣṇāya govindāya...//

> namo brahmaṇya-devāya
> go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca
> jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya
> govindāya namo namaḥ

So this is very important. We are worshiping, offering our respect to Kṛṣṇa, as //brahmaṇya-deva. Brahmaṇya-deva// means "the Lord who is worshiped by the //brāhmaṇas.//" So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not for the //śūdras.// Kṛṣṇa conscious... One who is elevated to the standard of becoming //brāhmaṇa,// they can become Kṛṣṇa conscious. But by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, every one comes to the stage of brahminical standard. Only to observe these four principles and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, you are at once more than //brāhmaṇa,// Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava position is more than //brāhmaṇa.// So in this age the //pāñcarātriki-vidhi// is introduced because it is very difficult to find out whether a person is actually son of //brāhmaṇa// or higher caste. It is to be accepted that everyone is //śūdra.// It doesn't matter whether and what he is. But he should be given chance to become the Vaiṣṇava, whose position is more than a //brāhmaṇa.// That is the highest gift of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He is claiming everyone to the highest stage of Vaiṣṇava. So your question is answered?

**Himavatī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Swamiji, did you say that householders should not associate with //brahmacārīs?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Who said?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Did you say that? Did you ever say that?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. No.

**Haṁsadūta:**
A //brahmacārī// should not associate with //brahmacāriṇīs.// But you did say that //brahmacārīs// should not associate with //brahmacāriṇīs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Actually, there is no... //Brahmacāriṇī// is not allowed in the //śāstra.// Where is the question of //brahmacāriṇī?// Because according to Vedic system, as soon as a girl is fourteen years old or sixteen years old, she is at once married. According to Vedic system, no girl should be allowed remaining unmarried. So there is no question of //brahmacāriṇī.// Every girl is supposed to be married. That is the Vedic system. A father's duty is that as soon as the girl is grown up, she must be married. She must be given in charge of a suitable boy. That is Vedic system.

//Striyaḥ śūdrās tathā vaiśyāḥ.// A woman is meant for being protected. So long she is not young, she is under the protection of the father. And as soon as she is young, she is given in charge, in charity. //Kanyā-dāna. Dāna// means charity. He should find out some suitable boys and give in charity: "My dear boy, take charge of this girl. So long she was under my charge. Now it is under your charge." So where is the //brahmacāriṇī?// There is no question of //brahmacāriṇī.// And when he is old enough, then the husband leaves the home and gives charge to the elderly son: "My dear boys, take charge of your mother." So she is always in charge of somebody. So according to Vedic system, there is no independent life of woman. //Na strī svātantryam arhati. Manu-saṁhitā,// that "//Strī"---strī// means woman---"should not be allowed independence." They should be given all protection. That's a very nice system. Not... Independence does not mean their position is very lower, no. Just like children. Children has no independence. No independence means they are well-protected. No independence does not meant that he has no independence to act. No. She has got. But under the protection. Just like there are some nation still now, protectorate. America is protecting. America is a big nation, and protecting another small nation. That does not mean they have no independence. They are also independent. They are acting like that. But because weaker, they should be given protection. Similarly, woman, children, //brāhmaṇa,// cow, old men, diseased men, they are to be protected. That is the social order.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Now, if someone is married, //gṛhastha,// under the //varṇāśrama-dharma,// is it the duty of //gṛhasthas// to have children? Are there some qualifications of //gṛhasthas,// that //gṛhasthas,// they're required, like they are required to support the //brāhmaṇas,// like that?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Gṛhastha? Gṛhastha// means to live with wife. This is the meaning of //gṛhastha.// And a //gṛhastha// is supposed to support others who are not //gṛhasthas// just like //brahmacārī. Brahmacārī// means student life. So //gṛhasthas// support them. [break] //...sannyāsīs,// other three classes. Because they are engaged in a different subject matter, they have no time to earn their livelihood, and therefore, those who are //gṛhasthas,// they take charge of him. This is the Vedic system. But they should live also on the bare necessities of life. They should not be luxurious. A //brahmacārī// cannot be luxurious. A //sannyāsī// cannot be luxurious. A //vānaprastha// cannot be luxurious. Luxury is allowed only to the householder because they are earning their own money. Others are dependent. So one cannot be luxurious at the expense of others. That is not allowed.

**Devotee (2):**
Pertaining to the //varṇāśrama-dharma// system, a mother is... the wife of a husband is usually put in charge of the oldest son. If the oldest... If, say, the husband is not present, then the oldest son is supposed to be in charge and he is a //brahmacārī,// in what way is the mother cared for?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, //brahmacārī// means he has gone out of home. //Brahmacārī// does not remain at home. He goes to the spiritual master's home. So there is no question of giving wife's charge to a //brahmacārī.// He is not at home. Do you follow? Yes. The elderly children mean those who are married also, those who are in //gṛhastha// life, for him, not for the //brahmacārī// or //sannyāsī.// Just try to understand. A //brahmacārī// and //sannyāsī// does not remain at home. The //brahmacārī// goes to the spiritual master's home and the //sannyāsī,// he is a traveler from one country to another, preaching. So they are not at home. So if they are not at home, who is taking charge? To give charge means the elderly son who is a married man, who is living at home, the charge is given of the mother to him. Is that all right?

**Devotee (2):**
Yes, but I'm still wondering. Is it the nature of the Kali-yuga that mother and father always separate? Is it the nature of the Kali-yuga that this family separation is always happening?

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Therefore I say, //kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ:// "In the Kali-yuga there are only //śūdras.//" There is no //brahmacārī// system, no... Now we are introducing it, even collecting from the //śūdras.// But actually, these four divisions, scientific division of social order for spiritual uplift..., that is already gone. It is not existing. Do you follow? //Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.// In the Kali-yuga, amongst the //śūdras,// there is no //āśrama,// simply earn, earn, get some money and eat. That's all. That is //śūdras// life. There is no question of Vedic culture, there is no question of knowledge. Simply labor, get some money, and eat. Almost like animal. So at the present moment, as you say, in the Kali-yuga, it is accepted that everyone, almost everyone is a //śūdra.// But in the //pāñcarātrika// system, not Vedic system, //Nārada Pañcarātra,// they are... Otherwise, do you mean to say because everyone has become //śūdra,// the science of Kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, should be stopped? No. Even they are //śūdras,// they should be given that opportunity. And that opportunity is given by Lord Caitanya very liberally: "Whatever you may be, come on, sit down, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and you become more than a //brāhmaṇa.//" This is the highest gift of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. But if you take otherwise from the social conventional life, oh, there is no //brāhmaṇa,// there is no //gṛhastha,// there is no //brahmacārī.// There is all gone, all finished. So those rules and regulation are not now applicable because amongst the //śūdras// there is no such rules and regulation. It is meant for the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas,// and those are gone. They are finished. Now, even though the people are in the status of //śūdra,// they should be given opportunity for spiritual advancement, and that is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's special gift, and very easy, that "Whatever you may be, you may be a //brāhmaṇa,// you may be a //kṣatriya, vaiśya,// that doesn't matter. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and gradually realize."

So at the present moment we cannot strictly follow; neither we are strictly following; neither it is possible to strictly follow. As far as possible, that's all. Our conception of //brahmacāriṇī// is in the Kṛṣṇa society, because... Especially in India, there is no //brahmacāriṇī.// But here, in your country, the boys and girls mix very freely, but just to restrict such free mixing, we think that the unmarried girls should remain separately. That is the contemplation. Actually, in the Vedic system there is no //brahmacāriṇī// system. Or get yourself married. That is our proposal, that we do not allow illicit sex life. That is impediment. That will not enhance your spiritual interests. Yes?

**Devotee (2):**
Swamiji, so the government, the present government in the world...

**Prabhupāda:**
We are not concerned with government. We say there is no //kṣatriya,// there is no government. At the present moment, anyone who has got some artificial power, he is government. That's all. You get some way or other a little vote, and you become government. So government does not mean that. Government is another. Because there is no //kṣatriya,// and where is government? They are thinking... Government means they should be always thinking how the citizens should be peaceful and happy and spiritually advanced. That is government. And who is caring for the citizens? They are simply exacting tax. That's all. So actually, in the Kali-yuga, because there is no //kṣatriya,// where is the government? //Śūdra// government is no government. //Śūdra// has no right to govern, but by force they are governing. That's all. "Might is right."

**Devotee (3):**
Swamiji, Indian literature and movies, they're... The subject is quite often romantic love. But in the literature of Indian religion, it seems to me that there's no place for romantic love. It's either divine love or it's, as you say, "cats and dogs." Do you find a place for romantic love within...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (3):**
What is it?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is in spiritual world, not in this material... In the material world there is no love. It is lust. We are making business under the name of love. In the material world there cannot be love because... Suppose a girl loves a boy or a boy loves a girl. Both of them are actuated by sense gratification. So that is not love. That is not love. When there is question of sense gratification, that is not love. Just like there is little example. Just like mother loves the child. There is no question of sense gratification. Simply for the sake of love, the mother loves the child. It is simply a little example. Similarly, love means if I love you, I don't want any return. Still, I love you. You may ill treat me. You may badly treat me. You neglect me. Still, I love you. There is no question of return from you. That is real love. That you cannot find in this material world. Because it is based on sense gratification, therefore there is love between a boy and girl, and as soon as there is little discrepancy, there is divorce. They are separated. Because the whole principle was on the basis of lust. So there is no love. Or we do not know what is meant by love. Love does not mean just a boy is attracted by a girl or a girl is attracted by a... That is not love. That is sense attraction. So in the material world there is no love. It is impossible. There is little, little example, just like I cited the example of mother and son or similar. That is also temporary. But real love is in the spiritual... That is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. That is real love. There is no separation. There is no cheating. There is no divorce. There is no sex attraction. Simply for love's sake, loving, that is real love.

**Devotee (3):**
But in the great literature, lust is not defined as love. It's more defined as something that has to do with spiritual affinity or communication or... In other words, there is a place for romantic love as distinct from lust because lust is rather elementary.

**Prabhupāda:**
Romantic love is in the spiritual world, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. That is the origin of romantic love. And here we are trying to imitate, although we are on the platform of lust. It is imitation, shadow, perverted reflection. So actually, Kṛṣṇa consciousness means we are trying to reach that platform of real love, exchange of love. The example... One example can be given: just like in diseased conditioned, actually there is no enjoyment, but still, the doctor gives some diet: "You eat this." But he does not enjoy. Eating enjoyment is in healthy life, not in diseased condition.

So our present condition is diseased. Why you are dying? Because you are diseased. Why you are becoming old? Because you are diseased. That is due to this body. But actually I am spirit soul. I am neither old nor diseased, but I have fallen into the condition of material contamination. Therefore I am thinking that I am diseased. This is called //māyā.// Just like in the dream I am feeling that a tiger is eating me, and I am crying, "Here is a tiger eating me, eating me. Save me." But there is no tiger. This is called illusion, or //māyā.// But so long we'll have this body just like so long we shall dream, we shall have to suffer the effect, even it is illusion. A man is crying, "There is a tiger." Actually, there is no tiger; neither tiger is eating. But because he is in hallucination, he is feeling the pain. That is actual fact. So the whole process is to stop this illusion, bodily contamination. Then we are in real life. And then we can understand what is love, what is reciprocation of love, everything. That is real, healthy life. So this human form of life is meant for getting out of this illusion to the spiritual life. That we have been discussing. But instead of taking advantage of this human life, if we simply treat ourself just like animals and be engaged with eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating, then we are missing the chance. So long we have got this human intelligence, we should utilize it for the highest perfectional stage of life. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Haṁsadūta:**
What happens to the Vaiṣṇava if he is following the spiritual master and he's not successful in spiritual life? Does he also take birth on higher planets like it says in the //Bhagavad-gītā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
If he is not successful, he is guaranteed to get another human form of life in rich family or a pious family.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Like //Bhagavad-gītā// says.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In rich family, to take birth in rich family, means he has no economic problem, so he can engage fully in developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And pious family means automatically he gets chance to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Haṁsadūta:**
So can it be understand that if a person, for instance, some Americans are very wealthy, that they...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They must have done pious activities in their previous life, all Americans. But they should know that this is their advantage to become Kṛṣṇa conscious: "We have no economic problem, but we are employing our facilities in sense gratification." That is a mistake.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Suppose a person is born in a very poor family. What does that mean? Suppose someone is born in a very poor, low, very low, and he becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is open to all. Just like we are calling everyone, "Come and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." It is open to all. There is no question of becoming poor or rich. But if he takes the advantage, that is up to him. We are not restricting here that only the rich persons or //brāhmaṇas// or pious family or rich family can come here, no. Everyone. Everyone is welcome. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ.// Poor family or uneducated family, uncultured family, they are called //pāpa-yoni,// sinful family. But Kṛṣṇa says, "Never mind. Even if he is in sinful family, whatever he may be, if he comes to Me, he also can enter into the spiritual kingdom." So there is no such restriction.

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]

//Parāṁ gatim// means the highest perfectional life. And that is practical. Here, when people come here, we don't inquire whether he is poor or rich or this or that. "Come on. Sit down. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." The opportunity is equal for everyone.

**Haṁsadūta:**
How is it that people who have done some pious activity, they get a nice birth in this statement, but usually people who are not wealthy or not so educated, sometimes they more or less take to worshiping Kṛṣṇa or God.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the grace of the devotees. The devotees offer their service, and they get the opportunity. Never mind what he is. It is the grace. Therefore, when //Bhāgavata// says, //yad-apāśrayāśrayam... Apāśrayāśrayam// means a devotee is already under the protection of God, and if one takes protection of a devotee, he also becomes a devotee and becomes purified. Therefore a devotee is more merciful than God. Even in God there is consideration-pious, impious. For a devotee there is no such consideration. "Everyone come." What is the purpose of opening so many centers? Just to give people opportunity to take advantage, without any consideration of his position. But if one does not take the advantage, it is up to him. That independence has everyone. We are inviting everyone to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but nobody is coming. What can we do? Those who are fortunate, they are taking advantage. That's all.

Now you take the //mṛdaṅga,// and you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Two //mṛdaṅgas// must be sounded equal, equally, on the same level. And how many cymbals? [end]
