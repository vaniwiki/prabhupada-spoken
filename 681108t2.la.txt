**Prabhupāda:**
Who has seen that house? Dayānanda? You saw?

**Dayānanda:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Any of the //brahmacārīs?//

**Dayānanda:**
No. Maṇḍalī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Maṇḍalī? You have seen?

**Maṇḍalī:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you have seen very nice house.

**Maṇḍalī:**
Mm. I thought it was nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. You have been in... We shall take that house. Very nice. You have seen inside also?

**Maṇḍalī:**
We looked at it through the windows.

**Prabhupāda:**
With Dayānanda?

**Maṇḍalī:**
Yes.

**Dayānanda:**
I have been in that place.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you have been? It is nice place?

**Dayānanda:**
I think it has a fireplace in there.

**Prabhupāda:**
That doesn't matter. [laughter] So you take that house. It is very nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many rooms does it have?

**Dayānanda:**
I think it has two bedrooms and a bathroom and a big living room and a dining room which you can make into a temple. And a kitchen too. There's a back yard with a tree in it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice. [Devotees discuss for some seconds.]

**Prabhupāda:**
And on the broad road. A very important place. Very nice. You immediately take that house. Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [//kīrtana//] [end]
