**Prabhupāda:**
//Nitāi-pada-kamala, koṭi-candra-suśītala, je chāyāy jagata jurāy.// This is a very nice song sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. He is advising that //nitāi-pada,// the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda //Kamala// means lotus feet, er, lotus, and //pada// means feet. So //Nitāi-pada-kamala// means the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda. //Koṭi-candra-suśītala.// It is just a shelter where you will get the soothing moonlight not only of one, but of millions of moons. Just we have to imagine what is the aggregate total value of the soothing shine of millions of moons. //Koṭi-candra-suśītala, je chāyāy jagata jurāy. Jagat,// this material world, which is progressing towards hell, and there is always a blazing fire, everyone is struggling hard, nobody finds peace. Therefore, if the world wants to have real peace, then it should take shelter under the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda, which is supposed to be cooling like the shining moon, millions in number. //Nitāi-pada-kamala, koṭi-candra-suśītala, je chāyāy jagata jurāy. Jurāy// means relief. If you actually want relief from the struggle of existence and if you actually want to extinguish the fire of material pangs, then Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura advises, "Please take shelter of Lord Nityānanda." What will be the result of accepting the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda? He says that //heno nitāi bine bhāi:// "Unless you take shelter under the shade of lotus feet of Nityānanda," //rādhā-kṛṣṇa pāite nāi,// "it will be very difficult to approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa." Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for approaching Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, to be associated with the Supreme Lord in His sublime pleasure dance. That is the aim of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's advice is "If you actually want to enter into the dancing party of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, then you must take shelter of the lotus feet of Nityānanda."

Then he says, //se sambandha nāhi jā'r. Sambandha// means connection or contact. "So anybody who has not contacted a relationship with Nityānanda," //se sambandha nāhi jā'r, bṛthā janma gelo tā'r,// "then he is supposed to have spoiled his human birth." In other song also Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu: "Anyone who does not approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa through the relationship of Nityānanda, his life is uselessly spoiled." //Se sambandha nāhi jā'r, bṛthā janma gelo tā'r. Bṛthā// means useless, //janma// means life, //tāra// means his, and //sambandha// means relationship. "So anyone who has no relationship with Nityānanda, he is simply spoiling his, the boon of human form of life." Why he is spoiling? //Se paśu boro durācār. Se// means that; //paśu,// animal; //durācār, dura,// misbehaved, mostly misbehaved. Because without our elevation to Kṛṣṇa consciousness through the mercy of Lord Caitanya-Nityānanda, the life is simply animal propensities. That's all. Sense gratification. And Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that ordinary animal, he can be tamed, but a human being, when he is animalistic, when he has simply animal propensities, oh, he is horrible. He cannot be tamed. Ordinary cats and dogs, even tiger, can be tamed. But a human being, when he goes out of his way, because human life is meant for being elevated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if he doesn't take to that, then his higher intelligence will be simply misused for animal propensities, and it is very difficult to tame him.

The enactment or state laws cannot make a man, a thief, an honest man because he cannot be tamed. His heart is polluted. Every man sees that a person committing criminal offense is punished by the government. And in scriptural injunction there is mention that "If you do this, you will be punished in the hell." He has heard from the scripture, and he has practically seen by the punishment of state laws. Still, he is not tamed. He cannot be tamed. So why? Because he hasn't got his relationship with Nityānanda. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //durācāra. Durācāra// means very much misbehaved. He cannot be tamed. //Sei paśu boro durācār.// And what they are doing? //Nitāi nā bolilo mukhe.// They do not know who is Nityānanda, so never says "Lord Nityānanda," or "Lord Caitanya." So //nitāi nā bolilo mukhe, majilo saṁsāra-sukhe. Majilo// means becomes absorbed, dipped into the so-called material enjoyment. They don't care who is Nityānanda or Caitanya. So //nitāi nā bolilo mukhe.// Because his life is animalistic, //sei paśu boro durācār,// very difficult to be tamed, so he is going down, deep into this material existence.

//Vidyā-kule ki koribe tār.// Somebody may say, "Oh, why he is going to hell? He is so much educated, he has got academic qualification, he has got degrees." Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura replies, //vidyā-kule ki koribe tār:// "If he has no connection with Nityānanda and if he does not come to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his //vidyā// or his so-called academic education, and //kula,// and birth in high family or great nation, will not protect him because nature's law will act. "Either you are born in a very big family or nation, or either you have got a very advanced academic education, at the time of death your work will be judged and you will get another body according to that work. So //vidyā kule ki koribe tār.// Why they are doing so, these animals, human animals? //Ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā:// "They have become maddened by a false concept of the bodily life." //Ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā:// "And for this reason they have completely forgotten their eternal relationship with Nityānanda." //Ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā, asatyere satya kari māni:// "Such forgetful persons accept the illusory energy as fact." //Asatyere. Asatya// means which is not fact. In other words, it is called //māyā. Māyā// means which has no existence, a temporary illusion only. So such persons who have no contact with Nityānanda, they accept this illusion as fact, this illusory body as fact. //Asatyere satya kori māni.//

Then he says, //nitāiyer koruṇā habe, braje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe.// He says that "If you actually want to approach the association of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, then try to achieve the mercy of Lord Nityānanda. When He will be merciful upon you, then you will be able to approach Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa." //Dharo nitāi-caraṇa duḥkhāni.// Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura advises us that "You firmly catch the lotus feet of Lord Nityānanda." Then again he says, //nitāiyer caraṇa satya.// One may not misunderstand that as he has caught hold of this //māyā,// similarly, the lotus feet of Nityānanda may also be something like that //māyā,// illusion. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura confirms that //nitāiyer caraṇa satya:// "The lotus feet of Nityānanda is not illusion; it is transcendental fact, //satya." Nitāiyer caraṇa satya, tāṅhāra sevaka nitya:// "And eveyone who is engaged in the transcendental loving service of Nityānanda he is also transcendental." If anyone is engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, immediately he achieves his transcendental position, spiritual platform. And spiritual platform means eternal, blissful. So anyone who engages himself in the service of Nityānanda, it is supposed that he is also immediately in his eternal position. //Nitāiyer caraṇa satya, tāṅhāra sevaka nitya, nitāi-pada sadā koro āśa.// Therefore he advises that "You always hope to catch the lotus feet of Nityānanda."

//Narottama boro duḥkhī.// Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, the //ācārya,// he is taking for himself that "I am very unhappy." He is representing ourselves. He is liberated, but representing ourself. "My dear Lord, I am very unhappy." //Nitāi more koro sukhī:// "So I am praying Lord Nityānanda to make me happy." //Rākho rāṅgā caraṇera pāśa:// "Please keep me in some corner of your red lotus feet." That's all... [end]
