**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes, read. Which verse? Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
"One who restrains the senses and organs of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects certainly deludes himself and is called a pretender [[books:bg:3:6|[Bg. 3.6]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is very important thing. //Yoga indriya-saṁyamya.// Yoga, the definition of yoga means sense control, controlling the sense. So here Kṛṣṇa says that you cannot control your senses artificially. It is not possible. Those who are trying... Just like some of the yogis, they close their eyes, "Oh, I'll not see beautiful woman." That is another practice, but that does not mean that he can control his senses. No. You cannot curb down the natural force of sense. This is the secret. People do not know. And if you let the senses go on in its own way, that is also dangerous. Then you are going to hell. //Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram.// If your senses are not controlled, then your senses will drag you to the darkest region of hell. That is another problem.

Generally, in the material world, //adānta-adānta// means uncontrolled, //go---go// means senses. //Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]. Simply repeating, chewing the chewed. The whole history of the world, you just study, is a history of sense gratification. Just take, for example, some twenty years ago one Mr. Adolf Hitler came in the scene, and there was great upheaval as war in Europe and America. From 1933 to 1947 or something like that, the whole world was in trouble. But he is gone, finished. And what did he do? Sense gratification, that's all. He wanted that this way government should be, according to his own sense. Another person, just like Mr. Churchill or your President Roosevelt, they said "No. The sense gratification should not be like that. The sense gratification should be like this." [laughter] So it is the war of sense gratification, that's all. One leader is presenting a program of sense gratification, another leader is presenting another program of sense gratification, and there is clash. This is going on. This is the history of the world.

And another class, they are thinking "Oh, there are so much trouble simply for sense gratification. Let us control our senses." //Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā,// just like Māyāvādī philosophers, Śaṅkarācārya. They say this world is useless. This world is useless. Only Brahman, the Supreme Brahman, impersonal Brahman, that is truth. That is also another sense gratification. That is bigger sense gratification. Why? These Māyāvādī philosophers, they want to merge into the existence of the Supreme One. That means by becoming Hitler, Churchill or Roosevelt, their senses were not very much satisfied. "Now," they say, "this world is false. Now let me become the Supreme." That is another sense gratification.

So this world, without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is simply sense gratification. That's all. One may present in one way, another may present in another way, but it is sense gratification. Therefore the so-called yogis, fifteen minutes meditation or, say, fifteen hours meditation or fifteen months meditation, but as soon as meditation finished---sense gratification. That's all.

So this sense gratification program is very strong. And so long you will indulge in sense gratification, the repetition of birth and death will go on. The repetition of birth. This body... //Bhāgavata// says that these people are working for sense gratification. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ. Pramattaḥ// means mad after sense gratification. //Kurute vikarma.// And for sense gratification, they are acting so abominably that it is not to be uttered. //Kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti.// They have engaged their life in sense gratification. //Na sādhu manye,// oh this is not good. This is not good.

Why? //Yata,// because, //ātmanaḥ,// the spirit soul, //ātmano 'yam... Asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. This body is temporary, but so long this body is there, you'll have to suffer. What is that suffering? The sum total of suffering is birth, death, old age and disease. This is due to this body. Therefore the problem is how to stop this material body, repetition. Today I have got this body, Indian, tomorrow I may get American, next birth... Tomorrow means next birth. Next birth another, next birth another, next birth another---it is going on. Going on. There is no stoppage, this transmigration of the soul.

But so long you do not stop it, there is no question of being freed from sufferings. They do not know it. They are thinking they are advancing. What advancement you have made? These sufferings are there---birth, death, old age and disease. You cannot stop it. //Ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ,// and even you go to this moon planet or to the highest planet, these four things will follow. So therefore sense gratification must be stopped. But if you want to stop it artificially it is impossible. Neither by this yoga process, neither by this //jñāna// process. Simply for the time being you can check.

Just like a naughty boy. By force, you can stop him acting mischievously. But as soon as he gets opportunity, again he will act so. Similarly, senses are very strong. You cannot stop them artificially. Therefore the only remedy is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These boys in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this is also sense gratification, eating nice //prasāda,// dancing, chanting, reading philosophy---but it is in connection with Kṛṣṇa. That is the significance. //Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.// It is the sense gratification of Kṛṣṇa. Not directly, but because I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, my senses are automatically satisfied. This process should be adopted. Artificially...

This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an art of living by which you will feel your senses are fully satisfied, but you are going to be free next life. This is the nice process. And artificially if you want to stop your senses, you will fail. That Kṛṣṇa says, "One who restrains the sense and organs of action but whose mind dwells on sense objects."

Just like Viśvāmitra Muni. There were many instances. He was a great king and he wanted to be yogi. And he went to forest, gave up his kingdom, went to forest. And he was meditating very seriously, and Indra, king of heaven, he sent some society girls of heavenly planet, Menakā. And she came. She began to dance before the closed-eyes yogi, and as soon as he heard, "Oh, there is very nice female voice and dancing," and as soon as he opened, he became captivated, embraced her. So everything gone. You see? So sense gratification, you cannot stop artificially. //Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.//

Therefore we advised our students, either boys and girls, that if you have... Of course, if you are serious in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you forget all these nonsense sense gratification, but still if you are disturbed, all right, get yourself married. Live peacefully, husband and wife, and both be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Gradually, you'll forget, both husband and wife. Don't try artificially. Artificially you'll never be successful. But if you can avoid it by advance and strong Kṛṣṇa consciousness...

Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura. But don't try to imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura. His stage was different. We cannot imitate. We can simply follow. //Anukaraṇa, anusaraṇa,// there are two Sanskrit words. One is imitation, and one who is following the footprints. If one tries to follow the footprints of great personalities, that is very nice, but we cannot imitate. Imitate. Imitation is dangerous.

Just like Lord Śiva, he drank an ocean of poison and he kept it on the throat. He did not allow to go down. So therefore his name is Nīlakaṇṭha. It became bluish. His neck is blue. But if somebody imitates Lord Śiva and indulges intoxication, //gāñjā,// he'll go to hell. He is powerful. Somebody says "Well, Lord Śiva is a smoker so we can also smoke." No. You cannot imitate. You can simply follow.

Just like the sunshine. The sunshine is so strong that it is absorbing the moisture of the filthy place, contaminated place where one is passing stool and urine, but still it is sun because sun is so powerful. But if you live in that place for some time where urine and stools are thrown, then you'll be contaminated immediately because you are not powerful. //Tejiyāsāṁ na doṣāya// [SB 10.33.29].

Those who are powerful, if they somebody does something which is very extraordinary, that is not to be imitated. You have to follow the rules and regulations. That will give you progress. Don't try to imitate. Just be in your position, try to follow the rules and regulations, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and gradually you'll get result. There is no need of being hasty. Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
Verse number seven: "On the other hand, he who controls the senses by the mind and engages his active organs in works of devotion without attachment is by far superior [[books:bg:3:7|[Bg. 3.7]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Instead of artificially trying to meditate and control the senses, just engage your senses in the activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and gradually you will be happy. Your senses will be controlled. Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
Purport: "Instead of becoming a pseudo-transcendentalist for the sake of wanton living and sense enjoyment, it is far better to remain in one's own business and execute the purpose of life which is to get free from material bondage and enter into the kingdom of God. The //svārtha-gati// or goal of self-interest..."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Svārtha-gati, svārtha-gati.// Yes.

**Sudāmā:**
"...or goal of self-interest is to reach Viṣṇu. The whole //varṇa// and //āśrama// system is designed to help us reach this goal of life. A householder can also reach this destination by regulated service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For self-realization one can live a controlled life as prescribed in the //śāstras// and continue carrying out his business without attachment, and that will lead him gradually to the progressive path. Such a sincere person who follows this method is far better situated than the false pretender who adopts show-bottle spiritualism to cheat the innocent public. A sincere sweeper in the street is far better than the charlatan meditator who works only for the sake of making a living."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that don't accept spiritual life for living. Just like we are sending the //saṅkīrtana// party. If we take it, "Oh, it is very easy method for living without working. We are getting money for our livelihood," this is not wanted. If your spiritual life is for...

Just like there are so many professional chanters. Not here. In India. Their business is... Because people like chanting, so they have made this chanting business. Or professional //Bhāgavata// reader. People like reading of //Bhāgavata.// There are many expert //Bhāgavata// readers. They can show many caricature just to attract people, and such people, generally, they describe the //rāsa-līlā// of Kṛṣṇa. Because //rāsa-līlā// is resembling just like dealings between young boys and girls, so they take that part, particularly, //rāsa-līlā.// Easy way.

And just like here in America, I've seen so many persons. They are writing books on Kṛṣṇa about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with the //gopīs,// as if Kṛṣṇa has no other pastime. Because these things are very easily saleable. So they are writing books on that. I've seen one book written by Mr. Bhaṭṭācārya about these, Kṛṣṇa's dealings with the //gopīs.// No. This is not good. You should not take Kṛṣṇa's activities, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, professionally, for livelihood. That is dangerous. Your life should be sacrifice for Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. Otherwise you shall be pretender. Yes, go on.

**Sudāmā:**
Verse number eight: "Perform your prescribed duty, which is better than not working. A man cannot even maintain his physical body without work [[books:bg:3:8|[Bg. 3.8]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna was talking. Kṛṣṇa never said Arjuna, "Oh, my dear Arjuna, you are My friend, intimate friend and devotee. All right. You haven't got to fight with your... Everything will be done by Me. You go to Himalaya and meditate." No. He never said that. Kṛṣṇa could do, Kṛṣṇa could fight for Arjuna. He was all-powerful. Without fighting, He could give him everything, but still, He wanted to engage him---that one should be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness along with his prescribed duty, that is required. Yes. [reading from text:] "Perform your prescribed duty which is better than not working."

If you cannot work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you better perform your prescribed duty according to //varṇāśrama.// Just like if you are a //brāhmaṇa,// then you have to act such way. If you are a //kṣatriya// you have to work in that way. But don't stop working. Kṛṣṇa says that, "A man cannot even maintain his physical body without work." He does not say that "You become Kṛṣṇa conscious beggar and maintain your body in that way." No. That is not required. That service for Kṛṣṇa should not be taken, should not be accepted as profession for livelihood. It should be simply for the service of the Lord. For the service of the Lord you can collect millions of dollars, but for your livelihood you cannot take one dollar from any person. Then you'll be indebted. You have to repay him. You cannot cheat others. It is very strictly enjoined. Simply for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction you can take, you can beg from others.

Just like according to Vedic system, begging is allowed. Begging allowed for whom? For the //brāhmaṇas,// for the //sannyāsīs,// for the //brahmacārīs,// because they collect money, beg from door to door for their benefit. Suppose a //brahmacārī// is going to a householder's place or a storekeeper's place, "Give us some contribution." He is not collecting that money for his livelihood. He's quite competent to work. But that one dollar which he contributes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, it is good for him. At least, some portion of his energy goes to Kṛṣṇa. That is the philosophy. Not that "Some way or other, I may collect some money and live very comfortably." No. We cannot do that. But you can accept Kṛṣṇa's //prasāda.// That is a different thing. But for personal comfort you have to work.

If you are a //karmī,// then you have to work. If you are a devotee, if you are completely... Devotee means //hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. Devotee means one who has engaged his senses cent percent for the service of the Lord, he is devotee, pure devotee.

So one who cannot become cent percent, all right, become fifty percent, twenty-five percent, one percent. Give something for Kṛṣṇa. Don't be miser. Because whatever you have got, it is Kṛṣṇa's. So long you catch it up, "It is mine," that is //māyā.// You just let loose it for [chuckling] Kṛṣṇa. Then it is freedom for you. You see. Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
Verse number nine: "Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed, otherwise work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kuntī, perform prescribed duties for His satisfaction and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Bondage means working for one's own account. The same example. Just like a soldier is fighting for the country under the command of the commander in chief. The more he's killing, he's getting promotion, he's getting medals. But the same man, when he comes back at home, if he kills one man, he's hanged. Why? Because that killing and this killing is not the same thing. So one who cannot engage himself cent percent in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, let him remain in his own position and try to sacrifice for Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa as far as possible.

The prescription is for the //gṛhasthas,// for the householder, as exemplified by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī that his income was divided into four parts. Fifty percent for Kṛṣṇa, twenty-five percent for the family and twenty-five percent for his personal reserve fund. That he showed us example how a //gṛhastha// should live. Not that out of hundred dollars, ninety-nine percent for my wife, and one percent for Kṛṣṇa. No. Not like that. One should sacrifice at least fifty percent. If he cannot sacrifice this... //Brahmacārīs, sannyāsīs,// they have sacrificed their everything, cent percent. The //gṛhastha,// they cannot do that. Because they have got wife, children. Therefore fifty percent.

So these are the prescribed rules and regulations for executing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Anyway, if one cannot sacrifice cent percent, let him sacrifice at least one percent, two percent. The more he does, that is, more he becomes free from bondage. And the more he uses his earning for sense gratification, the more he becomes bound up by the laws of material nature. Yes.

**Sudāmā:**
Purport: "Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that that purpose can be fulfilled. Yajña means Lord Viṣṇu or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial performances are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Viṣṇu. The //Vedas// enjoin: //yajña vai viṣṇuḥ.// In other words the same purpose is served whether you perform prescribed //yajñas// or directly serve Lord Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is therefore the performance of //yajña// as it is prescribed here in this verse. The //varṇāśrama// institution also aims at this, satisfying Lord Viṣṇu. //Varṇāśramācāravatā...//"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. By following the prescribed duties of a particular section of society in pursuance of the instruction of the //śāstra// means satisfaction of Viṣṇu. Yes.

**Sudāmā:**
"Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu. Any other work done in this material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. One has only to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness to satisfy Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu and while performing such activities, one is supposed to be in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very good and expert guidance."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Sudāmā:**
"One should therefore act very diligently under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa or under the direct instruction of Lord Kṛṣṇa, under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work. Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. This practice will not only save one from the reactions of work but will also gradually rise one to the platform of the transcendental loving service of the Lord which alone can uplift one to the kingdom of God."

Verse number 10: "In the beginning of creation the Lord of all creatures sent forth generations of men and demigods along with sacrifices for Viṣṇu, and blessed them by saying 'Be thou happy by this //yajña// [sacrifice] because its performance will bestow upon you all desirable things [[books:bg:3:10|[Bg. 3.10]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In the creation, after creation, the //yajña// was also created and everyone, created being, was ordered to perform the //yajñas.// One cannot... //Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyā na tyājyam.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also you'll find that you may be a renouncer, //sannyāsī.// A renouncer, you have renounced this world. But the four things, //yajña... Yajña// means working for satisfaction of Viṣṇu, //yajña. Dāna,// charity. //Yajña, dāna, tapaḥ. Tapaḥ// means austerity, following the rules and regulation for spiritual upliftment. These things are not to be renounced. If somebody says, "Oh, I have renounced the world," that does not mean you can renounce the service of the Lord. No.

Even if you are a //sannyāsī,// you have to work for Kṛṣṇa. Either you are a //sannyāsī// or you are a householder or //brahmacārī,// you have to work for Kṛṣṇa. But the advantage of //sannyāsī// is that because he has no encumbrances behind, he is detached from family relationship, he has full time service for Kṛṣṇa. Similarly //brahmacārī,// one who is not married, simply working under the order of the spiritual master, he has also cent percent time to work. So these are the secrets, that one has to work for Kṛṣṇa. Either he's a //brahmacārī// or //sannyāsī,// it doesn't matter, or householder. Otherwise he'll be captured by //māyā.// Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
Purport: "The material creation by the lord of creatures, Viṣṇu, is a sort of chance offered to the conditioned souls to come back to home, back to Godhead."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This material creation, you'll find in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that... Just like our body. This body is created at a certain period by the father and mother, and it remains for some time, it grows, it gives some by-product, then it dwindles, then vanishes. Just you can study from... Similarly the whole cosmic manifestation, this is a huge body. So it has a time of creation, its development, its by-products, its activities, then dwindling, then it will also vanish. It will also vanish.

But why this creation is there? This creation is there because those who are rebelled against God, Kṛṣṇa, they are not allowed to enter into the kingdom of God. They are kept aloof and this creation is made just to give them chance to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

The Vedic //śāstras// are there, the representatives of Kṛṣṇa are there. They are teaching, "My dear conditioned souls, please adopt this means and end your repetition of birth and death. Come to the kingdom of God." This is a chance.

But if somebody takes it, "Now I have got my body, let me enjoy my senses to the fullest extent," then he is doomed. Then he loses the chance. Therefore this human form of body should not be wasted simply by sense gratification like cats and dogs.

Those who do not know what is the complication of this material nature, this spiritual life or material life, they are rascals. Simply they are enjoying the senses which have been given by laws of nature. They are thinking "The best things we have got, let us enjoy it to the fullest extent." No, it is not good. You must take the advantage to get out of this field of material activities and enter into the kingdom of God. This is a chance of creation. Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
"All living entities within the material creation are conditioned by material nature because of their forgetfulness of their relationship to Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Vedic principles are to help us understand this eternal relationship. The Lord says that the purport of the //Vedas// is to understand Him."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That you will find in the Fifteenth Chapter, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]].

What is the purpose of so many scriptures and Vedic literature? Just to give you information that there is Kṛṣṇa and you are eternally related with Kṛṣṇa. You have forgotten. Just revive that relationship and perfect your life. That is the sum and substance of all Vedic literature. Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
"In the Vedic hymns it is said //patim...//"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Patiṁ viśvasyātmeśvaram.// Yes. Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
"The Lord of the living entities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Lord of the living entities. Just like here we have got a leader, a society leader or a party leader or a club leader, there are leaders. Some are led by somebody, some are led by somebody. We don't wish to discuss. But there is a leader. Without leader, nobody goes to hell, neither to heaven. There must be one leader. The supreme leader is Kṛṣṇa. Leader of the leader, leader of the leader. There are various types of leaders. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām, eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. These are the wordings in the //Vedas.// So He is the supreme leader. We are following some leader. Some leader is following Stalin, somebody Hitler, some leader is following Gandhi, somebody's following somebody, somebody. There must be some leader. But why not the supreme leader, who will never misguide you? He will give you actual path of happiness. Then you will become happy.

Kṛṣṇa therefore said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. "You give up all nonsense leadership. Simply come unto Me, surrender unto Me. I'll give you protection." That is wanted. Yes. Therefore we are following leader. There is no doubt about it. But there is misleader. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]].

Just like a blind man is leading other blind men. What is the use of such following leaders? He is blind and I am blind. So if he leads me to cross the road, what [is] my life? My life is in danger. So don't follow these misleaders. Kṛṣṇa is approved leader. All leaders of the society, any part of the world, has accepted Kṛṣṇa as the supreme leader. Follow Him. Then you'll be happy. Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
"Viṣṇu is the Lord of all living creatures, all worlds, and all beauties, and protector of everyone. The Lord created this material world for the conditioned souls to learn how to perform //yajñas// for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu so that while in the material world they can live very comfortably without anxiety in life. Then after finishing the present material body they can enter into the kingdom of God. That is the whole program for the conditioned souls. By performance of //yajña// the conditioned souls gradually become Kṛṣṇa conscious and become godly in all respects. In this age of Kali the //saṅkīrtana-yajña,// or chanting the holy names of God, is recommended by the Vedic scriptures, and this transcendental system was introduced by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu for the deliverance of all men. //Saṅkīrtana-yajña// and Kṛṣṇa consciousness go well together. Lord Kṛṣṇa in His devotional form as Lord Caitanya is worshiped in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// as follows, with special reference to the //saṅkīrtana-yajña.// 'In this age of Kali people who are endowed with sufficient brain substance will worship the Lord who is accompanied by His associates, by performance of //saṅkīrtana-yajña.'// "

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There is a verse, //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. Those who are intelligent class of men in this age, they'll worship this form of the Lord. Who? //Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam.// The Lord who is chanting always Kṛṣṇa, but His body is not black. Fair-complexion. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam.// Followed by many devotees. Just like you'll see the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's picture. He is followed always by His associates and devotees. //Sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam. Yajñaiḥ saṅ...// This form of the Lord should be worshiped. Therefore we do not worship Kṛṣṇa directly. Through Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, through //saṅkīrtana// movement. That is the process prescribed in the //śāstra.//

You cannot worship Kṛṣṇa directly. Then you will misunderstand. Those who are not following the path of Caitanya's //saṅkīrtana// movement, if they want to understand Kṛṣṇa, they'll simply misrepresent Kṛṣṇa's this //rāsa-līlā// in this way. That's all. Go on.

**Sudāmā:**
"Although other //yajñas// prescribed in the Vedic literature are not easy to perform in this age of Kali, the //saṅkīrtana-yajña// is the easiest and it is sublime for all purposes, as is recommended in the //Bhagavad-gītā.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also it is recommended, //satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. So this process, chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// and gradually to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is the only means for, I mean to say, elevating yourself to the perfectional stage which is meant for this human life. Otherwise we are simply, what is called, cutting our own throat. That's all. Thank you. No more. [devotees offer obeisances] Any question?

**Madhudviṣa:**
Prabhupāda? We read in the //Bhagavad-gītā// today in verse number...

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't go outside today's lecture. You try to... Question means the lecture on which I was speaking. If there is any difficulty, that should be questioned. Otherwise, if you go outside, that present atmosphere created for this purpose, that will be lost. So question means on the subject matter which is already discussed. If there is any doubt or if there is any difficulty for understanding the subject matter which we have already discussed, that is the subject matter of question. Yes?

**Woman devotee:**
I'm not sure if I heard you correctly. Did you say that Kṛṣṇa could not be worshiped directly? Could not be?

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa directly, yes. Through the process. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself. So the //śāstra// advises, instructs us, that those who are intelligent, intelligent. The word is used there, //sumedhasa. Sumedhasa// means those who have got nice brain substance. So Kṛṣṇa, you can approach Kṛṣṇa. There are so many ways you can approach Kṛṣṇa. And in other words it is said, //mama vartmānuvartante pārtha manuṣyāḥ sarvaśaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa, our relationship is with Kṛṣṇa, and that relationship cannot be cut off. That is there. Even those who are disobedient to Kṛṣṇa, those who are atheists, godless or Kṛṣṇa-less, they are also obeying Kṛṣṇa's order. They are also.

Just like an outlaw who does not care to abide by the laws, he is also abiding the laws of the state in a different way. He is being forced. So those who are not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he's being forced by //māyā// to act. So that is there already, direct connection is there in this way or that way.

But here it is prescribed that anyone who wants the ultimate perfection of life they should worship Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is... Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī worshiped Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]

He said that "My Lord, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, You are the most munificent incarnation because You are distributing love of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore I offer You my respectful obeisances on account of Your distributing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and this is possible because You are Kṛṣṇa Yourself." //Kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne.// "Simply You have assumed the name of Kṛṣṇa Caitanya." So these are the injunction of the //śāstras,// and if you follow Caitanya Mahāprabhu...

And Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, gives you the easiest method. He says that "In this age simply chant Kṛṣṇa and you'll get all perfection." So that is the easiest process. Therefore if you follow the footprints of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then it become easier. Kṛṣṇa says //sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]] in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu says "All right. You cannot give up all of a sudden everything. You just join in this chanting." That is more magnanimous, you see.

We ask nobody that "You fulfill all conditions of Kṛṣṇa consciousness; then you come here." No. We simply say "Please come here. We have taken this nice hall, and these boys, they are, I mean to say, giving their blood to maintain the establishment. We don't want anything from you. Please come and chant with us." That is our request. We don't ask you that because we are paying four hundred, five hundred dollars for this building, you give us something. If you give, it is welcome. But we simply request you, please come and chant with us and dance with us and take the //prasāda.// That's all. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's program. Because we know that Caitanya Mahāprabhu will supply us everything. We don't depend on your contribution, but if you give, oh, that is good for you. But our only request is that please come here. Please chant with us, dance with us. That's all. Yes?

**Viṣṇujana:**
How will it be possible, Prabhupāda, for a man whose mind is clouded to constantly chant Hare Kṛṣṇa? A man who's always thinking thoughts about family, friends, country, nation?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Think of. At the same time, chant. Two things will go on, and this will conquer. [chuckling] As //māyā// is forcing you to drag you from this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you also force //māyā// by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. There is fight. And //māyā// will go away.

> daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī
> mama māyā duratyayā
> mām eva ye prapadyante
> māyām etāṁ taranti te
> [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]

This //māyā// is very strong. She'll force you to entice you to other path. But if you do not stop, if you chant loudly...

Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura was chanting, and //māyā// could not victimize him. You know that? What was his stand? Simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. //Māyā// could not entice. //Māyā// failed. //Māyā// became his disciple. He did not become //māyā's// disciple.

This is tug of war. So don't be afraid of //māyā.// Simply enhance chanting and you'll be conqueror. That's all. //Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati// [[books:sb:6:17:28|[SB 6.17.28]]]. We are not afraid of //māyā// because Kṛṣṇa is there. Yes. Kṛṣṇa says, //kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. You just declare, "My devotee will never be vanquished by //māyā." Māyā// cannot do anything. Simply you have to become strong. And what is that strength? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, loudly. Yes.

**Woman devotee:**
What is //māyā?// I know that it's attractive...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Māyā// means which drags you from Kṛṣṇa. That is //māyā.//

**Woman devotee:**
Is it a spiritual form?

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever form may be, [it is] force. We shall see form later on. You just... Just like a police sends a warrant, arrest. You do not ask what is the form of the police, but here is warrant, you have to go. Force, that's all. Similarly, don't try to understand what is //māyā's// form, but you just feel her force, how she is acting. How she is putting you in difficulty. You see? There are so many things. //Māyā// puts into this difficulty and you are encumbered. That we have to understand, how I have become encumbered. In my childhood I was free. There was no encumbrances. Now I am encumbered. I am harassed. This is //māyā's// action. So if you want to get out of this //māyā's// influence, then you have to become Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is no other alternative. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [//kīrtana//] [end]
