**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"The demigods, being pleased by sacrifices, will also please you. Thus nourishing one another there will reign general prosperity for all [[books:bg:3:11|[Bg. 3.11]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is very important point. The godless society, they are thinking that everything is being done by nature. Nature is there, but there is a controller of nature. Just like this electricity. Electricity is natural power but there is a powerhouse and there is a resident engineer. Similarly, everything supplied by nature, water supply, heat supply, air, so there is a controller and he is called demigod. They are all appointed servants by the Supreme Lord. It is simply foolishness that nature is working automatically. This is rascaldom. They do not know. The so-called scientists who are thinking that everything is going on automatically.

Yes, it is going on automat... Just like the government affairs are going on automatically. A child can say that everything is going on automatically, but a person who knows the government, the constitution, he knows how departmental managements are going on. That is the difference between the so-called foolish person and one who knows the things. One who knows the things, he knows that everything is controlled by a person. That person is called demigod.

So we have to satisfy. Therefore the //yajña,// sacrifice, is recommend. So that is mentioned here, that "Demigods, being pleased by sacrifices..." Just like to the income tax officer if you pay regularly your income tax then there is no trouble. Everything will go on. Otherwise, the state will enforce to exact income tax. So we are receiving heat from the sun. Similarly, we are receiving rains. Don't you think that we have to pay some tax? That is required. That is enjoined in the Vedic literature. You must. Therefore so many sacrifices are recommended. If you do not offer those sacrifices, then there will be irregularity of rain, irregularity of heat, excessive heat, excessive cold, and people will suffer. This is the process. They do not know it. Read it, purport.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Purport: "The demigods are empowered administrators of material..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "The demigods are empowered administrators of material affairs." How can you deny the existence of demigod? Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"The supply of air, light, water, and all other benedictions for maintenance of the body and soul of every living entity are entrusted to the demigods who are innumerable assistants in different parts of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like my body. Different limbs are working and helping me. I want to go somewhere. The limbs, or the part which is called leg, they will carry me. Similarly, by the supreme order of Kṛṣṇa, all these demigods are acting just like my different parts of the body are acting. Yes. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Their pleasures and displeasures are dependent on the performance of //yajñas// by human beings. Some of the //yajñas// are meant for satisfying the particular demigods, but even in so doing Lord Viṣṇu is worshiped in all //yajñas// as the chief."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like if you obey the department, say, the police department. You are obeying the police department means you are obeying the government. Nobody can manufacture a police department and force you to obey. Because it is one of the important department of government, therefore as soon as there is police handcuff you have to stop. You may be very rich man, millionaire, but you have to obey the orders of the police, otherwise you will be prosecuted. And wherefrom. That man is an ordinary man; simply he stops you. Why do you stop? Because you obey the government.

Similarly, all obeisances offered to the demigods, they are meant for giving obeisances to the Supreme Lord. That is the beginning. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"It is stated also in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that Kṛṣṇa Himself is the beneficiary of all kinds of //yajñas.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Taxes. Treasury department collecting taxes. That is not the tax officer of the treasurer is collecting for his personal self. He is collecting for the government. Similarly, these demigods accepting these different kinds of sacrifices, they are on account of the Supreme Lord. Therefore ultimately you have to satisfy the Supreme Lord.

So in this age it is very difficult to satisfy all the demigods differently. People are so much harassed. The best thing is to satisfy directly the Supreme Lord. And what is that simple method? Just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Because we are so fallen in this age, the simple chanting of glorification of the Lord will be equal to performances of all kinds of sacrifices. That is mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. Those who are...

Because each kind of sacrifice, they are very costly affairs. It is not possible in this age. Tons of butter or ghee wanted to arrange for a sacrifice. It is very difficult to find out a pound of butter in a house. And where is the question of tons? Of course, in your country still, butter is available, but in India practically butter is finished. So in one day the whole world will not see any more butter or rice or wheat. Everything will be finished because with the advancement of the age of Kali everything will deteriorate so badly that all supplies will be stopped practically. At that time people will live just like animals.

So this is the only means, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In this age, simply, in whatever condition you may be, you can simply sit down and chant. There is no expense, there is no loss. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, and all demigods and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everyone will be satisfied. You'll have no difficulty. This is the program of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"//Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. Therefore ultimate satisfaction of the Lord is the chief purpose of all //yajñas.// When these sacrifices are perfectly performed, naturally the demigods in charge of the different departments of supply are pleased and there is no scarcity in the flow of natural products."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because after all, however tractor, machine, or farm arrangement you may make, unless there is supply of heat and water, it is all useless. You cannot produce grains just like wheat or rice or pulses[?] in your factory or by your will, defying the nature's law. Oh, that you cannot do. Real, your life is in the hands of the demigods. If they stop supply, sunshine, if they stop supply, water supply, how you can produce? Therefore you have to satisfy them. People have practically forgotten their duty.

[indistinct] ...and regulations, there is no scarcity. The modern theory---the population has increased---this is a nonsense theory. If there is production is sufficient, where is the question of population increasing? Let population increase. The supplier will give you. In the Vedic literature we find, //eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.// That Supreme Lord is supplying everyone food. Why do you think of human society? What is the human society? Out of 8,400,000 forms of life there are only 400,000 forms of human life. And 8,000,000 forms they are lower animals, birds, beasts, aquatics. Who is supplying their foodstuff? Everyone is sumptuously fed by the grace of God.

Why not you? You are suffering because you are disobeying, therefore you are suffering. That you should know, only the suffering population theory, this theory, that theory, only in the human society because they are regularly defying the existence of God---science, science, science. Now there are so many suffering people. Why your science cannot provide them food? So this is wrong theory. You have to satisfy the supreme supplier. Then you'll get sufficient production and you'll be happy. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Performance of //yajñas// has many side benefits, ultimately leading to liberation from the material bondage. By performance of sacrifice, all activities become purified as is stated in the //Vedas.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. When you perform... Just like we are performing here sacrifice of //saṅkīrtana.// Everything you will find here purified. In this temple, you go corner to corner, you'll find everything sanctified, purified. Why? Because we are, this sacrifice of //saṅkīrtana// is being performed. So as soon as you take up the process of sacrifice, automatically, everything will be hygienic, purified, health, wealth, everything, complete. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"As will be explained in the following verse, by performance of //yajñas,// the eatables become sanctified, and by eating sanctified foodstuffs one's very existence becomes purified."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Even George Bernard Shaw he has written, "You are what you eat." Your body is purified or impurified according to the foodstuff you eat. Therefore we forbid, "Don't eat this, don't eat that." You have got sufficient food, grains, milk, butter, and fruits, sufficient. Why should you eat meat? That is not sanctified. But this is nature's product, offered to Kṛṣṇa, and you eat, and you become healthy and sanctified in mind, in body. Then you can understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You can make progress in that way. If your body is not sanctified, if it is impure, how can you understand the pure consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Therefore we have to follow these principles, regulations. Yes. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"By the purification of existence, the finer tissues in the memory become sanctified, and, memory being sanctified, one can think of the path of liberation."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like in our contaminated state we become diseased. What is disease? As soon as you contaminate or infected by some impure thing you become diseased. Similarly, our this disease, material disease, birth, death, old age, they are some kind of disease. Otherwise, I am spirit soul, I am pure, as pure as God because I am part and parcel of God. Due to my impurities of this material body I am suffering. So if you purify your existence then you get the quality in complete pureness of God. You become happy. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12], //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1], you become jolly. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. As soon as you purify yourself and become identified with the existence of God, immediately you become joyful, no anxiety. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. So you have to purify your existence. If you keep your body impurified, then how you can relish the purified consciousness? So you have to do it. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"All these together lead to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the great necessity of present-day society."

Twelve: "In charge of the various necessities of life, the demigods, being satisfied by the performance of //yajña// supply all needs to man. But he who enjoys these gifts without offering the demigods in return is certainly a thief [[books:bg:3:12|[Bg. 3.12]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Just see, a strong word is used. Suppose if there is mention, there is recommendation that you should perform //sūrya-yajña. Sūrya// means the sun. The sun is supplying you so much heat, warmth, and don't you want to give him some tax or satisfy him by sacrifices? So that is our duty. If you are receiving from me so many things and if you do not at least acknowledge your gratitude, then you are a thief. We are receiving so many benefits through the agents of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and if we do not acknowledge even, "God is great, He is so kind, in spite of our so many faults He's supplying us nice foodstuff, nice everything," so how much ungrateful the human society has become, just imagine. And they want peace and prosperity. Nonsense. Where is peace and prosperity? You must suffer. You must suffer. That is your due. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Thirteen: "The devotees of the Lord are released from all sins because they eat food which is offered first for sacrifice."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Devotees how much they are grateful, //kṛṣṇa-prasāda.// "Kṛṣṇa, You have sent so nice fruit, nice flower. First of all You enjoy [[books:bg:3:13|[Bg. 3.13]]]." Oh, God is very satisfied. Just like a boy, "My dear father, this sweetmeat is very nice. You take." Father knows that sweetmeat was purchased by him. Where the boy can get the sweetmeat? But because the son is offering to the father in love and affection, father says, "Oh, you have give me. It is very nice." Therefore we cannot offer any Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is self-sufficient. He does not require your offering of this foodstuff, that food. But if you offer with affection and love He accepts. And as soon as Kṛṣṇa accepts, your life is sanctified immediately.

Therefore we should eat //kṛṣṇa-prasāda,// nothing more. Not in the hotel, not in the restaurant. Simply //kṛṣṇa-prasāda.// That will keep me purified always. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Others, who prepare food for personal sense enjoyment, verily eat only sin."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Simply you have nice foodstuff, palatable dishes. You can prepare palatable dishes for Kṛṣṇa. There are hundreds and thousands of preparation. But as soon as you prepare for yourself or you try to satisfy your tongue, then you are bound up by the laws of nature. Anything. Because that is sinful. Sinful. If you do not acknowledge, if you do not acknowledge the authority, if you do not feel your gratitude for the supplier, then you are a thief. Especially it is mentioned. "It is thief." I am taking your things, I am eating, but I am not feeling any gratitude for you, then I am a thief. Yes. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Fourteen: "All living bodies subsist on food grains. Food grains are produced from rains. Rains come from performance of sacrifice and sacrifice is born of man's work [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
This is a cycle. Cycle. We are living on food grains. We cannot live on meat-eating. It is not possible. However a great meat-eater may be he must have some grains some vegetables. That is his life. Yes. Therefore grains, vegetables, they are actually our food. Now, I am living and getting energy by eating grains and vegetables and how my energy should be utilized? It should be utilized for the purpose from where I am getting energy. I am getting energy from the Supreme Lord by supply of this foodstuff; therefore my energy should be utilized for the service of the Supreme Lord.

That is called sacrifice. So I should be strong enough to offer sacrifice to the Lord. By sacrifice, the demigods, the Lord will be pleased and there will be sufficient rain. There will be again production. Again you will eat. Again you will get strength. Again you will offer //saṅkīrtana.// This cycle. This cycle must go on. This cycle. You get from the Supreme Lord supply by His natural ways. You get strength. And your strength should be utilized not for sense gratification. "Because I am now very stout and strong, oh, let me enjoy senses." Then you are sinful. And if you use your strength for satisfying the Supreme Lord then your energy is properly utilized. This is the way.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Fifteen: "Activity, //karma,// arises from the //Vedas// and the //Vedas// spring from the Supreme Godhead. Therefore the all-pervading Transcendence is eternally situated in acts of sacrifice [[books:bg:3:15|[Bg. 3.15]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Purport: "//Yajñārtha-karma,// or the necessity for work for the satisfaction..."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yajñārtha-karma. Yajña// means "sacrifice," //artha,// "for the purpose of," and //karma,// "fruitive activity." Everyone is engaged in some activity, but what shall be the purpose of such activity? //Yajñārtha. Yajñārtha// means simply to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa. That should be the purpose. //Yajñārtha-karma,// yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"We have to work for the satisfaction of the //yajña-puruṣa,// Viṣṇu, then we must find the direction of work in Brahman, or the transcendental //Vedas.// The //Vedas// are therefore codes of working directions. Anything performed..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like you get license to do some business. Why? The government gives you license to do some business. That means if you want to do business you must satisfy the government. You cannot do whimsically. You cannot do. This is //Veda.// One who is law-abiding subject. Similarly, anyone who is following the codes of //Vedas// or scriptures he is actually working. Otherwise, persons who are violating, he is becoming implicated, criminals. Similarly, if we defy the rules and regulation of //Vedas// or scripture, then we are being implicated, the criminals for being punished. Therefore work should be //yajñārtha,// for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu or the supreme government. That should be the mode of work. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Anything performed without the direction of the //Vedas// is called //vikarma.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vikarma.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"//Vikarma// or unauthorized work or sinful work. Therefore one should always take direction from the //Vedas...//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The same example as I always cite, that your direction is "Keep to the right." Then if you don't keep to the right, if you go to the left, then it is //vikarma,// your driving is unlawful. You are immediately... Similarly, as soon as you perform //vikarma... Karma, vikarma, akarma,// there are three kinds of work. So //vikarma// means against the rules. So as soon as we act against the rules, immediately we are bound up by the criminal codes. Therefore if we work for the supreme government, Kṛṣṇa, simply for His satisfaction, there is no //vikarma,// there is no criminality. There is no criminality. Because ultimately the Supreme Lord is to be satisfied. So if you work for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord you are not subjected to any criminal law. You are free. That is liberation. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"As one has to work in ordinary life by the direction of the state, similarly one has to work under the direction of the supreme state of the Lord. Such instructions in the //Vedas// are directly manifested from the breathing of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is said all the four //Vedas,// namely the //Ṛg Veda, Yajur Veda, Sāma Veda// and //Atharva Veda,// are emanations from the breathing of the great Personality of Godhead. The Lord, being potent, can speak by His breathing air, as it is confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We should not think how it is that Lord gave His laws through breathing. Because with breathing we cannot speak anything. That means I am calculating the strength of God with my capacity. The //Brahma-saṁhitā// says no. //Aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya vṛttimanti.// The every part, or every limb, of the body of Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality, can act of other limb. Just like I can see through the eyes only. But Kṛṣṇa can see through His finger also. That is His omnipotency. Omnipotency means every limb has got the potency of all other limbs. That is called omnipotency. We speak of omnipotency, but we do not know the meaning of omnipotency. This is omnipotency, that by His glance God created this world by His glance. //Sa īkṣata sa asṛjata.// These are Vedic hymns. So we can say that how is that, simply God saw and there was creation? Yes. That is omnipotency. Why do you think in terms of your capacity? That is materialism. As soon as you think of God in my capacity, that is materialism. You have to accept as it is said in the //Vedas.// Then you understand what is God. Otherwise you cannot. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"The Lord, being potent, can speak by breathing air as is confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,// for the Lord has omnipotence to perform through each of His senses the actions of all other senses. In other words, the Lord can speak through His breathing and He can impregnate by His eyes. It is said that He glanced over the material nature and thus fathered all the living entities. So after impregnating the conditioned souls into the womb of the material nature, He gave His direction in the Vedic wisdom as to how such conditioned souls can return home, back to Godhead. We should always remember that the conditioned souls in material nature are all eager for material enjoyment, and the Vedic directions are so made that one can satisfy one's perverted desires, then return to Godhead, having finished his so-called enjoyment. It is a chance for the conditioned souls to attain liberation. Therefore the conditioned souls must try to follow the process of //yajña// by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Those who have not followed Vedic injunctions may adopt the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and that will take the place of performance of Vedic //yajñas// or //karmas.//"

Sixteen: "My dear Arjuna, a man who does not follow this prescribed Vedic system of sacrifice certainly leads a life of sin. For a person delighting only in the senses lives in vain [[books:bg:3:16|[Bg. 3.16]]]." Purport...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is very important. Read purport. Go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"The Mammonist philosophy of work very hard and enjoy sense gratification is condemned herewith by the Lord. For those who want to enjoy this material world, the above-mentioned cycle of sacrifices is absolutely necessary. One who does not follow such regulations is living a very risky life, being condemned more and more. By nature's law this human form of life is specifically meant for self-realization in either of the three ways---namely //karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga// or //bhakti-yoga.// There is no necessity of rigidly following the performances of the prescribed //yajñas.// Such transcendentalists are above vice and virtue, but those who are engaged in sense gratification require purification by the above-mentioned cycle of //yajña// performances. There are different kinds of activities. Those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious are certainly engaged in sensory consciousness and therefore they need to execute pious work. The //yajña// system is planned in such a way that the sensory conscious persons may satisfy their desires without becoming entangled in the reactions to such sense gratifying work. The prosperity of the world depends not on our own efforts but on the background arrangement of the Supreme Lord, directly carried out by the demigods. Therefore these sacrifices are directly aimed at the particular demigod mentioned in the Vedas. Indirectly, it is the practice of Kṛṣṇa consciousness because when one masters the performance of //yajñas// one is sure to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. If having performed //yajñas// one does not become Kṛṣṇa conscious such principles are counted as only moral codes. One should not, of course, limit his progress to the point of moral codes, but should transcend them to attain Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is transcendental. Moral codes, they are up to material perfection. Of course, one who has not attained material perfection, he cannot attain to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like one who has not passed his graduation in the university, he cannot take up law course. That is law in India. But one who has taken to the law course, it is to be understood that he has passed his graduation in the college. Similarly, one who has taken Kṛṣṇa consciousness in seriousness, then it is to be understood that he has performed all kinds of sacrifices. That is the result.

But one who is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he must abide by the rules of sacrifices. But in this age it is very difficult to follow all the rules and regulations of sacrifices. Therefore it is the greatest gift of Lord Caitanya that you come directly to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, everything will be done. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice. Immediately you rise to the transcendental platform simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Seventeen: "One who is, however, taking pleasure in the self, who is illumined in the self, who rejoices in and is satisfied with the self only, fully satiated, for him there is no duty [[books:bg:3:17|[Bg. 3.17]]]."

**Prabhupāda:**
Here it is plainly said by Lord Kṛṣṇa, "the self, one who is taking pleasure in self." How we can take pleasure in self? As soon as we engage ourself with the Supreme Self. That is enjoyment. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. The Supreme Lord is joyful. Just like if you mix with a joyful society or joyful person, then automatically you become joyful. There is no necessity of becoming joyful separately. That association will make you joyful. If you mix with a society criminal, automatically you become criminal. There is no necessity of learning criminality separately. By association, you'll do that.

Similarly, if you associate with the supreme joyful, Kṛṣṇa, automatically you become joyful. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Automatically. There is no necessity separately how to become joyful. Simply by association. Therefore here it is said that "One who rejoices in." That rejoice is by association with the Supreme. "And is satisfied with the self only." With self. My self, what I am? My identity is that I am eternal servant of God. So as soon as I engage myself in the service of God, that is my self-realization. And if I enjoy in that self-realization, then I have no other duty. Finished, I have finished all duty, all sacrifice, everything complete.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Purport: "A person who is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious and by his acts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is fully satisfied, no longer has anything to perform as his duty. Due to his becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious all the dirty things within are instantly cleansed, ordinarily an effect of many, many thousands of //yajña// performances. By such clearing of consciousness one becomes fully confident of his eternal position in relationship with the Supreme. His duty thus becomes self-illuminated by the grace of the Lord and therefore he no longer has anything to do in terms of the Vedic injunctions. Such a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is no longer interested in material activities and no longer takes pleasure in material arrangements like wine, women and similar infatuations."

Eighteen: "A self-realized man has no purpose to fulfill in the discharge of his prescribed duties, nor has he any reason not to perform such work. Nor has he any need to depend on any other living being [[books:bg:3:18|[Bg. 3.18]]]."

Nineteen: "Therefore without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty, for by working without attachment one attains the Supreme [[books:bg:3:19|[Bg. 3.19]]]."

Purport: "This Supreme is the Personality of Godhead for the devotees and liberation for the impersonalist. A person acting for Kṛṣṇa or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, under proper guidance and without attachment to the result of the work is certainly making progress towards the supreme goal of life. Indirectly Arjuna is told that he should fight the battle of Kurukṣetra without attachment in the interest of Kṛṣṇa because Kṛṣṇa wanted him to fight. To be a good man or a nonviolent man is also a personal attachment, but to act on behalf of the Supreme..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, to be good man, this consciousness is, "I am very good man." Or to bad man, "I am very bad man." But if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, "I am neither good man or bad man. I am Kṛṣṇa's man." That's all. Finished. Finished. All business. "I am Kṛṣṇa's man." That's all. If Kṛṣṇa wants to kill you, I'll kill you. If Kṛṣṇa says you do that, I'll do that. That's all. So I am Kṛṣṇa's man. So he's immediately transcendental to all goodness or badness.

All right. Stop here. Any question? Yes?

**Vīrabhadra:**
When it says "duty," does that mean you don't have to do anything at all?

**Prabhupāda:**
If Kṛṣṇa orders we shall do, but not purposely at your whims. There is nothing wrong for a Kṛṣṇa conscious person. But what we think materially wrong, if it is ordered by Kṛṣṇa, we shall do it. For Kṛṣṇa there is no wrong. Just like the government orders somebody to be hanged. That means kills. So that does not mean the government becomes condemned. But if I kill, I immediately become condemned. The government is still pure because for higher purpose the government can order somebody to be hanged and somebody to be rewarded. Everything is justice.

Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa says, "You do this," we have no consideration whether material calculation, it is good or bad. That's all. But we cannot do on our own account. Then it is implication. That is the technique. Don't think that "We are now Kṛṣṇa conscious, we are Kṛṣṇa's persons, we can do anything." Just like if a policeman thinks that "I am government man. I can do anything, whatever I like." That is wrong. He cannot do that. But if Kṛṣṇa orders, then you can do. Yes.

**Guest:**
Kṛṣṇa tells Arjuna he can go to the sun planet in the //Gītā.// Why does He say that? I can't remember where. I remember reading that Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna he can go to the sun planet by worshiping Him. Why does He say that?

**Prabhupāda:**
If I say that you can go to Santa Fe, what is the harm? What is the wrong there?

**Guest:**
You can go to the sun planet by worshiping...

**Prabhupāda:**
Anywhere, if Kṛṣṇa says that you can go to the sun planet, what is wrong there?

**Guest:**
Well, I thought you'd go to Kṛṣṇa, along with Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
And if Kṛṣṇa desires that he should go to sun planet then he'll go. What is wrong there? There is nothing wrong. You have to act what Kṛṣṇa says. It doesn't matter what He says. You should not select Kṛṣṇa's order according to your choice. You should accept Kṛṣṇa's order by Kṛṣṇa's choice. If Kṛṣṇa says you go to hell, "Yes, I am going to hell." That's all. //Svargāpavarga-narakeṣv api tulyārtha-darśinaḥ.// For a Kṛṣṇa conscious person there is no distinction that this is hell, this is heaven.

Just like we have come here to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We have no distinction between Los Angeles and Vṛndāvana. Wherever I am, I am in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is Vṛndāvana. That's all. I don't live in Los Angeles or anywhere. I live in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, therefore I live in Kṛṣṇa. So your principle should be like that. You be fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you forget all other things. Kṛṣṇa is all-pervading, therefore your living is all-pervading. Is that all right?

So any other question?

**Guest:**
You said that as the age of Kali-yuga progresses there'll be no more butter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, it has already begun. You are killing cows, the source of butter. Now, time will come, there will be no more cows. Misusing. And then where you will get butter? You cannot manufacture in your factory a cow or butter.

**Guest:**
We can take care of cows, can't we?

**Prabhupāda:**
You should. Otherwise you are ungrateful. You are drinking milk, you are taking so much butter, milk product, and as gratitude you are killing cows? You should be ashamed. Even if you have no human feelings. You suck the breast of your mother and kill? Is that humanity?

So this will be, in due course, the milk supply will be stopped. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// There will be no more milk supply at the end of this Kali-yuga. Three, four things will be stopped---grains, sugar, and milk will be stopped. And fruits will not be... Without any pulp. It will be simply seed. Just like in mango there is seed and pulp. In future you'll simply have seed, no pulp. So you'll eat mango simply by tasting the seed. There will be no more mango pulp. These are stated in the //Bhāgavatam.//

So people are so foolish that they are continually committing sinful activities. Therefore //yajña// is recommended. But they cannot perform //yajña// also. The only alternative is to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness to save you from all risky life. Yes.

**Revatīnandana:**
So when... When they say they have a surplus of grains now, they are burning these great mounds of grains, this means that in the future there will be no grains for this country to eat?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. As soon as you make misuse, the supply will be stopped. After all, the supply is not in your control. You cannot manufacture all these things. You can kill thousands of cows daily, but you cannot generate even one ant. And you are very much proud of your science. You see. Just produce one ant in the laboratory, moving, with independence. And you are killing so many animals? Why? So how long this will go on? Everything will be stopped.

Just like a child. Mother is giving good, nice foodstuff, and he's spoiling. So what the mother will do? "All right. From tomorrow you'll not get." That is natural.

**Jaya Gopāla:**
Is it true that Kṛṣṇa has all these things in each planet simply because of the presence of a pure devotee?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Kṛṣṇa appears not in consideration of this planet, but just like there is a headquarter of the governor or some government officer in the particular place. Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa appears in this universe, He comes in this planet in that Mathurā-Vṛndāvana. Therefore it is called so sanctified. Whenever He appears, He appears there. And that Vṛndāvana happens to be situated within this planet. So this planet is very fortunate in that sense. Yes. Yes?

**Guest:**
When the people realize there's no more butter will they get attached to other things or will they realize the mistake they made?

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Guest:**
When people realize, when there's no more butter will people realize they've made a mistake or will they get attached to something else?

**Prabhupāda:**
A sinful, sinful man never realizes his mistake. Therefore he's miscreant. You ask any miscreant, any criminal, "So you have done wrong," he'll be angry. //Upadeśo hi mūrkhāṇāṁ prakopāya na śāntaye.// So the miscreants and sinful, they cannot realize unless they are in good association and blessed. So therefore good association required. We are giving chance, this temple is open to give people good association. "Please come, try to understand." If one is fortunate he understands, he takes to this principle and thus becomes, I mean to say, purified gradually.

Therefore in this age Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended that you do not require to change your position. You simply try to hear about Kṛṣṇa from the rightful source. That's all. Then everything will be all right gradually. Everyone of us are mistaken or whatever you may call, but Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He gives His book, //Bhagavad-gītā,// He sends His representative, He comes Himself as Lord Caitanya to deliver us. He sends Lord Jesus Christ. So so many arrangement, but we don't take advantage. We are so fool and sinful. But still, the propaganda will go on.

Just like father, however misguided a son may be, whenever the father gets a chance, he says, "My dear son, you don't do this. It is not good. You do this." So that is the duty of the father. Similarly, we are bent upon continuing our sinful activities but there is sufficient arrangement by Kṛṣṇa to instruct us and to lead us back to Godhead, back to home.

**Guest:**
How do you account for the fact that man sometimes takes animals and feeds them and protects them, whereas otherwise these animals might have died of starvation or exposure or something?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why you are anxious about the animals being starvation? You take care of yourself. You don't be philanthropic, "Oh, they'll starve. Let me eat." What is this philanthropy? Kṛṣṇa is supplying food. If he dies out of starvation, it is Kṛṣṇa's responsibility. Nobody dies of starvation. That is a false theory. Have you seen any animal dying of starvation? Have you got any experience? Have you seen any bird died of starvation? There is no question of starvation in the kingdom of God. We are manufacturing these theories for our own satisfaction, sense satisfaction. There is no question of starvation in the law of God. Elephant eats hundred pounds at a time. Who is supplying foodstuff? There are millions of elephants in the African jungle, in Indian jungles. They require one hundred pounds at a time to eat. Who is supplying food? So there is no question of starvation in the kingdom of God. Starvation is for the so-called civilized men.

Yes?

**Guest:**
If man wasn't meant to eat meat, why in nature do the other animals kill to eat?

**Prabhupāda:**
Are you other animal?

**Guest:**
Well, we're all animals.

**Prabhupāda:**
You count amongst the animals? You classify yourself with the animals?

**Guest:**
Well, we're all animals.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not all. You may be, but we are not. Do you like to be classified with the animals?

**Guest:**
You don't?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Do you like yourself, do you like to be...

**Guest:**
I don't feel that I'm better than the animals, no.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why? Why are you talking then?

**Guest:**
Because I have respect for all of God's creatures.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why you have come here? You respect for all and you kill animals?

**Guest:**
I didn't say that I kill animals.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why do you say that? What is your question?

**Guest:**
I said why, if man is not meant to eat meat, that in nature the animals eat meat? They eat each other.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the question? I cannot...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's saying if man is not meant to eat meat, then why is it that some animals eat meat? He's saying that we are animals also. Now, we're not meant to eat meat, but other animals are permitted to.

**Prabhupāda:**
Other animals, they [eat] meat, but they follow the nature's law. They don't eat grain.

**Guest:**
We don't follow nature's...?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. You don't follow.

Just like a tiger. A tiger eats meat, but tiger does not come to eat grains and fruits. But you eat meat and grains, fruits, milk, whatever you can get you eat. Why? Is that natural? Tiger will never come to claim on the grains, "Oh, you have got so much grain. Give me." No. Even there are hundreds bags of grains, you don't care, but he'll pounce upon a... That is his natural instinct.

But why do you take grains, fruits, milk, meat, and whatever you get. What is this? You are neither animal or human being. Misusing your humanity. You should think that what is eatable for me? A tiger may eat meat. It is a tiger. But I am not tiger. I am human being. And if I have got sufficient grains, fruits, vegetables, and other things, God has given, why should I go to kill a poor animal?

This is humanity. You are animal plus human. If you forget your humanity, then you are animal. So we are not simply animal. We are animal plus humanity. If we increase our quality of humanity, then our life is perfect. But if we remain in animality, then our life is imperfect. So we have to increase our human consciousness. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious.

What is the purpose of eating? To live. If you can live very peacefully, very nicely, with good health, by eating so many varieties of foodstuff given by Kṛṣṇa, why should I kill an animal? This is humanity. Why should I imitate an animal? Then what is the difference between animal and human being? If you have no discretion, if you have no consciousness.

Besides that, scientifically, your teeth is meant for eating vegetables. The tiger has teeth for eating meat. Nature has made it like that. It has to kill another... Therefore he has got nails, he has got teeth, he has got strength. But you have no such strength. You cannot kill a cow like that, pouncing like tiger. You have to make slaughterhouse and sit down at your home. Somebody may slaughter, and you can eat very nicely. What is this? You do like tiger. Pounce upon a cow and eat. [laughter] You cannot do that. You cannot do that.

**Guest:**
What you're saying, then, you believe that nature's perfect.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nature's law. That is... A tiger is made by nature's law in that way; therefore he can do that. You cannot do it. Your nature is different. You have got discrimination, you have got conscience, you are claiming civilized, human being. So you should utilize these things. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, perfect consciousness. So human life is meant for raising oneself to the perfection of consciousness, and that is Kṛṣṇa conscious. We cannot remain in tiger consciousness. That is not humanity. Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Have we fallen from higher to lower or do we come from the very bottom of plant then to animal?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Naturally fallen from higher to lower. Then you make progress, again come to this human being. This is a via media with good consciousness. If you utilize your good consciousness then you go still higher, you go to God. But if you don't use your higher consciousness then again go to down. This is going on, cycle of birth and death. This human form of life is meant for self-realization, God realization. If you don't use properly our this life for God consciousness or Kṛṣṇa consciousness and go back to the kingdom of God, then we have to suffer again in the 8,400,000 species of life cycle, one after another. That is our choice.

So the best choice is to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness or God consciousness and your life is perfect. Don't be misguided. Take to God consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and your life... Then it will be proper use of this human form of life. Otherwise, if we indulge in meat-eating like tiger, I may get life like a tiger next life, but where is the use?

Suppose if I become a very strong tiger in my next life, is that very good promotion? Do you know the life of tiger? They cannot eat even daily. They pounce upon one animal and keep it secretly and they eat for a month the decomposed flesh. Because it is not possible to get chance, kill an animal. God will not give such chance. You see? It is natural. In the jungle wherever there is a tiger, all animals will go away. They will also try to protect themselves, self-protection. So rarely, when he's too hungry, then God gives him a chance to pounce upon another animal. A tiger cannot get to many palatable dishes daily. Oh. It is in human form of life. If we misuse, then we are... You see? We have got all facilities and if we misuse it, then go to the tiger life. Be very strong with pouncing capacity. That's all. All right. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
