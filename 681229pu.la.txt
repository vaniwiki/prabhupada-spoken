**Prabhupāda:**
This song was sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, a great devotee-//ācārya// in the disciplic succession of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya. Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava Sampradāya means the disciplic succession who are coming down from Lord Caitanya. So this Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has written many songs, and it is recognized as a authority by all the Vaiṣṇavas. He has sung the songs in simple Bengali language, but the purport and the deep meaning of the song is very significant. He says: //gaurāṅga bolite habe pulaka-śarīra.// This is the perfection of chanting, that as soon as we chant or take the name of Lord Gaurāṅga, who initiated the //Saṅkīrtana// Movement, at once there will be a shivering in the body. So it is not to be imitated. But Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is recommending when that opportune moment will come to us, that as soon as we shall chant Lord Gaurāṅga's name, there will shivering in the body. And, after the shivering, //hari hari bolite nayane ba'be nīr,// by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa there will be tears in the eyes. Then again he says //āra kabe nitāicand koruṇā karibe.// We are all asking about the mercy of Lord Nityānanda. Nityānanda is supposed to be the original spiritual master. So we have to approach Gaurāṅga, or Lord Caitanya, through the mercy of Lord Nityānanda. So what is the symptom of a person who has achieved the causeless mercy of Lord Nityānanda? Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that one who has actually received the causeless mercy of Nityānanda, he has no more any material desire. That is the symptom. //Āra kabe nitāicand koruṇā karibe saṁsāra-vāsanā mora kabe tuccha. Saṁsāra-vāsanā// means desire for material enjoyment, when it will become very insignificant. Of course, so long we have got this body we have to accept so many things, material. But not in the spirit of enjoyment, but to keep up the body and soul together. So...

And he says further: //rūpa-raghunātha-pade ha-ibe ākuti.// When I shall be very much eager to study the books left by the Six Gosvāmīs. //Ākuti// means eagerness. One because Rūpa Gosvāmī is the father of this devotional service. He has written that book, //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.// In that book there is nice direction. Of course, in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// and other books we have given the summary of those direction in our book, Teachings of Lord Caitanya. So one has to learn the conjugal loving affairs of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa through the teachings of these Six Gosvāmīs. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura giving us the direction that you do not try to understand the conjugal love of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa by your own endeavor. You should try to understand by the direction of the Gosvāmīs. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings [break] ...Narottama

> rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhaba śrī yugala-pīriti

//Yugala-pīriti// means conjugal love. And another he sings that //viṣaya chāḍiyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana.// This mind, so, so, so long the mind is too much absorbed in materialistic thought, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Vṛndāvana. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says: //viṣaya śuddha kabe śuddha ha'be mana.// When my, my mind will be completely purified, being freed from material anxieties and desires. Then I shall be able to understand what is Vṛndāvana, what is conjugal love of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and then my spiritual life will be successful. [end]
