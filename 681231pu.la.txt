**Pradyumna:**
It's very beautiful.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everything will come out nice, beautiful. [break---Prabhupāda sings //mahāmantra// in morning tune, also mixing the words] Like that. I asked you not to sit down before Deity like that. You should always sit very respectfully. This is to be practiced. So these words can be mixed in a different way to make the sound palatable. That's all. Just repeat. The Hare Kṛṣṇa is there, but in a different way. That's all. [end]
