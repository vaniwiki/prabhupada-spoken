**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhajahū re mana, śrī-nanda-nandana-abhaya-caraṇāravinda re.// This is a song composed by Govinda dāsa, a great poet and Vaiṣṇava. He says, addressing his own mind Because mind is the center of all elevation. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that if you have your mind controlled, then your mind is the best friend. But if your mind is uncontrolled, then he is your greatest enemy. So we are seeking after friend or enemy. So both of them are sitting with me. If we can utilize the friendship of the mind, then we are elevated to the highest perfectional stage. But if we create mind as my enemy, then my path to hell is clear. Therefore Govinda dāsa Ṭhākura, he is addressing his mind. The yogis try to control the mind by different gymnastic process. That is also approved. But it takes a long time, and sometimes there are failures. In most cases they are failures. Even a big yogi like Viśvāmitra, he also failed, what to speak of these teeny and nonsensical yogis.

So Govinda dāsa advises that "You just engage your mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then mind becomes automatically controlled." If the mind has no chance of being engaged in any other business except Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he cannot become my enemy. It is automatically my friend. That is the instruction in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. Lord, King Ambarīṣa, he first of all engaged his mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. So similarly, here also, Govinda dāsa Ṭhākura, he is asking his mind: "My dear mind, you just engage yourself to the lotus feet of //abhaya-caraṇāravinda.//" //Abhaya-caraṇāravinda.// That is the name of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. //Abhaya// means fearless. If you take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa then you immediately become fearless. So he advises "My dear mind, you just engage yourself on the service of the lotus feet of Govinda." //Bhajahū re mana śrī-nanda-nandana.// He does not say "Govinda." He addresses Kṛṣṇa as "the son of Nanda Mahārāja." "Because that lotus feet is fearless, you will have no more any fear from the attack of //māyā.//"

"Oh, I have got to enjoy so many things. How can I fix up my mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa?" Then Govinda dāsa advises, "No, no." //Durlabha mānava-janma.// "You don't waste your life in that way. This human form of life is very rare. Out of many, many thousands and millions of births, you have got this opportunity." //Durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge.// "Therefore don't go anywhere. You just associate with pure devotees." //Taraha ei bhava-sindhu re.//" Then you shall be able to cross of the ocean of nescience." "Oh, if I engage my mind always in Kṛṣṇa, then how I shall enjoy my family, my other paraphernalia?" So Govinda dāsa says, //ei dhana yauvana.// "You want to enjoy your wealth and your youthful ages," //ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana,// "and you want to enjoy the society of freindship, love and family, but I say," //ithe ki āche paratīti re,// "do you think that there is transcendental pleasure in these nonsense thing? No, there is none. It is simply illusion." //Ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana, ithe ki āche paratīti re. Durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge, taraha ei bhava sindhu re.//

Then again he says that

> śīta ātapa bāta bariṣaṇa
> ei dina jāminī jāgi 're
> viphale sevinu kṛpaṇa durajana
> capala sukha-laba lāgi' re

Now Govinda dāsa is reminding his mind: "You have experience of your material happiness. So material happiness means, the ultimate goal of material happiness is sex life. But don't you remember how long you can enjoy this sex life?" //Capala.// "Flickering. Say, for a few minutes or moment. That's all. But for that purpose you are working so hard?" //Śīta ātapa.// "Don't care for snowfall. Don't care for scorching heat. Don't care for torrents of rain. Don't care for keeping night, night duty. Whole day and night you are working. And what is the result? Simply for that flickering momentous enjoyment. Are you not ashamed of this?" So //śīta ātapa, bāta bariṣaṇa, ei dina jāminī jāgi re. Dina// means day, and //jāminī// means night. So "Day and night, you are working so hard. Why?" //Capala sukha-laba lāgi' re.// "Simply for that flickering happiness." Then he says, //ei dhana yauvana, putra parijana, ithe ki āche paratīti re.// "There is no happiness actually, eternal happiness, transcendental happiness, in enjoying this life, or this youthful age, or family, society. There is no happiness, no transcendental happiness."

Therefore //kamala-dala-jala, jīvana ṭalamala.// "And you do not know how long you shall enjoy this life. Because it is tottering. You are on the tottering platform. Just like there is water on the lily leaf. It is tilting. At any moment it will fall down. So our life is tilting. At any moment it may collapse. We may meet, by chance, any danger, and finished. So don't waste life in that way." //Bhajahū hari-pada nīti re.// "Be always engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the success of your life." And how to discharge this Kṛṣṇa consciousness? He advises, //śravaṇa kīrtana, smaraṇa vandana, pāda-sevana dāsya re.// You can adopt out of the nine ways of devotional service any one. If you can adopt all of them, that's very nice. If not, you can adopt eight of them. You can adopt seven of them, six of them, five of them, four of them. But even if you adopt only one of them, your life will be successful. What are those nine methods? //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam.// Hearing from authoritative sources. And chanting. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam. Smaraṇam.// Memorizing. //Vandanam,// prayers. //Śravaṇa kīrtanaṁ, smaraṇaṁ vandana, pāda-sevanam.// Offering service to His lotus feet as eternal servant. //Pūjana sakhī-jana.// Or just try to love Kṛṣṇa as your friend. //Ātma-nivedana.// Or give up everything for Kṛṣṇa. That is the way of devotional service, and Govinda dāsa is aspiring after that Kṛṣṇa consciousness business. [end]
