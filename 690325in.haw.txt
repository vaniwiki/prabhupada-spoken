**Prabhupāda:**
So now you come here. You have given... There is no //āsana,// sitting? Give him one piece of... So I shall perform this initiation ceremony. If you kindly sit, you can see. [break] I am traveling everywhere. Next I am going to San Francisco. But my disciples, they will stay here. This Gaurasundara dāsa, Mr. Gary, he will live here with his wife. Yes. So temple, if people come, that is temple. You see? That is temple. And if we, suppose, construct a huge building and nobody comes, then what is the use of spending money? We are not after such thing. But if somebody has got money, he wants to construct temple, it is welcome. We can give nice plan how to do it. In India there are Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temples, just like one temple is as good as a big fort. They spend so much. You see? But here also, in your country, there are many big churches. So people, formerly they were religiously inclined. So either Christian, Muhammadan or Hindus or anyone, they were constructing temple, churches, mosques. But that mentality is gone. You see? They will spend lots of money for a skyscraper building to get income, and temple is called nonproductive building. You see? They do not wish to engage their money in nonproductive thing because they have become economic. But that is wrong theory. You see? That economic means forgetting God. And that means, I mean to say, animal life. If by becoming a human being, he becomes an animal, if he thinks that he has become economical, that is not very sane conclusion. So godless means animal. The animals, they do not know how to create a church or temple or mosque. The mosque or temple or church, they are done in the human society. So when the human society forgets this responsibility from economic point of view, that means they degrade to the animal life.

Now you can chant, those who are initiated. [ceremony begins, chanting of //oṁ apavitraḥ//] [break] ...Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Then take another bead, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. In this way you come to this end. Don't cross this summit. Again begin from this end. In this way chant daily sixteen rounds. One round, two round, three round, four round, fifth round, like that. And you have noted down the rules and regulation? Yes. And the ten kinds of offenses to give up, chanting? Yes. And your Godbrothers will help you. I don't think there is name, any Balabhadra? So your spiritual name is Balabhadra. Just bow down. [devotee repeating each word:]

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine

All right, take your beads and be happy, and Balabhadra dāsa brahmacārī. Is that all right? [laughter]

**Sudāmā:**
Prabhupāda, what does Balabhadra mean?

**Prabhupāda:**
Balabhadra is this, Balabhadra.

**Sudāmā:**
Ah, Balarāma.

**Prabhupāda:**
Balabhadra and Balarāma are two different names, Kṛṣṇa's elder brother. Now chant. No. We have to perform. Yes. Chant your beads. Give me lamp. [break] This boy was chanting automatically, so there is no question of waiting for sixteen years. Any child, even we have seen dancing; sometimes dogs are also dancing. In Tompkinson Square in New York, when I was chanting, oh, so many children, dogs, and everything. This is for me? All right. First of all give him. You take some. All right. [end]
