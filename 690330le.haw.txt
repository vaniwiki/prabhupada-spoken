[Gaurasundara lectures for about 25 minutes, then asks for questions]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you can question about the speaking.

**Guest:**
Could you elaborate a little bit on the point of debate of Kṛṣṇa manifesting everything, and therefore He's attractive?

**Gaurasundara:**
Well, the point is, Kṛṣṇa is the fountainhead of everything---everything, what you can conceive and what you can't conceive. And that relationships stands for every entity. Therefore He is all-attractive because He has everything.

**Guest:**
He's all-attractive because He is the source?

**Gaurasundara:**
Yes. Any desirable quality is perfect in Him; therefore He is all-attractive.

**Prabhupāda:**
How a man becomes attractive? First of all we have to understand that. Suppose a very rich man is attractive, a very intelligent man is attractive, a beautiful man is attractive, a famous man is attractive, a wise man is attractive, a renounced man is also attractive. These are attractive features. So if we analyze Kṛṣṇa, we find all these six opulences of attractive men fully present in Kṛṣṇa. So even from historical references, there is not a single person who can be compared with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore He is all-attractive. And everything that we experience, that is the manifestation of Kṛṣṇa's energy. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śruyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. His energies are differently manifested. Similarly, in //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// also, it is said, //parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktis tathaiva akhilaṁ jagat. Akhilaṁ jagat// means the whole cosmic manifestation is a display of the multi-energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So because He is fully energetic, therefore He is attractive and the cause of all causes. These are the evidences of Vedic literatures. And when He was actually present, He was attractive in so many features. In the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, when He was speaking the //Bhagavad-gītā,// the speech which He delivered, although He is not present now in our vision, you cannot find in the whole world such attractive speech of wisdom. Nobody can say. What we have got, practical experience, about His speech, which is still going on, still we are trying to understand. The greatest scholars of the world, the philosophers, they are trying to understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// There were many, many great scholars and saintly persons all over India, but each and every one of them have tried to understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// Even Professor Einstein, he was reading //Bhagavad-gītā.//

So His attractiveness is evidently presented by the wisdom of //Bhagavad-gītā.// So He is all-attractive. There is no doubt about it. And in the Vedic literature we also understand: //tasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati:// "If you can understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or the Absolute Truth, then //sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati,// you can understand everything, how it is working." Because everything is display of His energy. So if you can understand how His energy is acting, then you can understand the whole cosmic manifestation. That is explained in the Vedic literature. Just like in our presence we have got practical experience, the sun. The whole material world is maintained by sunlight. The planets are rotating by the heat of sunlight; the vegetation, the water, everything is being conducted by the sunlight. It is by scorching sunlight the water is evaporated from the sea. It is formed into gas, cloud, and it is distributing all over the land. Then vegetation is coming, and it is becoming green, yellow, many colorful. So actually, the sun is the cause of all material manifestations. So if anyone can study what is sun, then he can understand how everything is appearing. That is practical.

Similarly, sun is also not ultimate cause. The ultimate cause is Kṛṣṇa.

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

//Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// means "the cause of all causes." And the sun is described as the eye of Kṛṣṇa. //Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇām.//

> yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ
> rājā samasta [sura-mūrtir] aśeṣa-tejaḥ
> yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro...

The sun is so powerful that it is the life of every planet. Without sunlight, nobody can see anything. We are very much proud of testing everything by seeing: "I want to see." Now that seeing power is resting on the sunlight. Without sunlight, your eyes are useless. Therefore sun is the eyes for all planets. All planets means all the residents of each and every planet. //Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtiḥ.// Therefore he is the king of all planets. These are described in //Brahma-saṁhitā. Aśeṣa-tejaḥ,// unlimited potencies or unlimited heat. There is no limit how much heat is there in the sun globe. So that sun also rotating. //Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro.// That sun is also rotating under the guidance of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// The sun is rotating; it has got its orbit. It is rotating sixteen thousand miles per second. It is rotating. That you cannot deny. These are facts described. So somebody has arranged how the sun is rotating. Just like your sputnik rotates in the space by the scientist who is playing on the electronic machines in the laboratory, and the sputnik is rotating. So why don't you think that the sun is also rotating under some guidance? How you can deny it? So that is explained in the //Brahma-saṁhitā: yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro.// It has also a lifetime duration. As soon as that lifetime duration is finished...

Now, now, who gave him this lifetime duration, this movement? Just like Śrīman Gaurasundara began his speech, that without pushing on, without being moved by somebody else, nothing can move. So He is also moving. //Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// Therefore He is there.[?] We must know how He is acting. Simply by understanding the word "Kṛṣṇa," you do not... We must know thoroughly how Kṛṣṇa is acting. That is all explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// If we study //Bhagavad-gītā// very carefully, as it is, we can understand. //Tasmin vijñāte sarvam eva vijñātaṁ bhavati.// If you can simply understand the Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa philosophy, then you understand everything. It is so perfect. [break] ...question you can put. [break] Now, modern-days people are very much attracted by scientific knowledge. Oh, there is complete scientific knowledge in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So if you want to understand, even from scientific point of view, these boys will be able to answer you. [break] ...question, then chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
