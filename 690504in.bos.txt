**Prabhupāda:**
//...rādhā śrīla govinda-devau preṣṭhālībhiḥ sevyamānau smarāmi.// [devotees chant responsively] //Śrīmān rāsa-rasārambhī vaṁśī-vaṭa-taṭa-sthitaḥ karṣan veṇu-svanair gopīr gopīnāthaḥ śriye 'stu naḥ.// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. All right. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Give me your beads. [//japa//] Begin from here. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Then take next. In this way you'll come this side. You don't cross this. Again begin here, and come to this. Such sixteen rounds must be done every day. Your spiritual name is Chandanācārya dāsa. Chandanācārya. C-h-a-n-d-a-n-c-h-a-r-y-a dāsa. Chandanācārya, a great preacher of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So you are servant of that. You have to preach very nicely. Bow down.

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine

[devotees repeat responsively] Now chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and be happy. Take this. [//japa//] You could not secure like that? This is all right. [//japa//] Put in your bag and do... [//japa//] Begin from here, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Next. In this way come to this point, again like that. And where is that chart, the ten kinds of offenses and the regulative principles?

**Haṁsadūta:**
I have it in Montreal. They have that. They already have that, Prabhupāda. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You must give them copies. Is there any name Madana-mohana dāsa? Yes? There is? So his name should be Baradrāj. B-a-r-a-d, Baradrāj, r-a-j, Baradrāj. Baradrāj is another name of Lord Viṣṇu. Baradrāj dāsa Brahmacārī. All right. Just bow down. Bow down. Bow down.

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine

[devotees repeat] All right. Take your beads. Be happy. Baradrāj. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [//japa//] Chant. [//japa//] Keep it there. You can keep it.

**Śāradīyā:**
You want to move more closer?

**Prabhupāda:**
You can keep it.

**Candanācārya:**
Put it down?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Nama.// You take little, little, everyone, and when I say //svāhā,// you put it.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Prabhupāda? Is Śāradīyā dāsī going to take the //Gāyatrī?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Gāyatrī,// so where is that mantra sheet? Then I'll give you after. That's all.

> oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bahyābhyantara śuciḥ
> śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu

//Vande ahaṁ śrī-guru...// [chants prayers for fire sacrifice, devotees responding]

**Devotees:**
Careful, careful.

**Prabhupāda:**
Here. Not at me. [chants prayers] Now each one, banana. Stand up. //Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// Stand up. //Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya govindāya namo namaḥ.// [repeats twice with devotees responding] Now put silently. //Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Now bow down, //namo oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya.// [devotees offer obeisances] [end]
