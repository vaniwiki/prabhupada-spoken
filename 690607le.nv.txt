**Prabhupāda:**
Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja? You can sit down here. That's all. No more want. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja feels inconvenience. Yes.

So I thank you very much for you participating in this //saṅkīrtana// movement.

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalaṁ
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

This is a verse from Vedic scripture, //Bṛhan-nāradīya Purāṇa,// that "In this age, if you want to realize yourself, then the simplest process is to chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//' ' It has got so transcendental power that simply by participating in this chanting process, gradually you will come to the highest stage of transcendental position. How it happens? That is also described in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛt satām
> [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]

Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is present before you in three features. Simply you have to make your senses perfect to perceive it. Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is a person, a person like you, like me. Just like we are facing each other, similarly, when you are spiritually perfect, you will be able to see Kṛṣṇa exactly like face to face.

Kṛṣṇa is not imperson. He is imperson also. He is present in three features: by His personal feature, by His impersonal features, and His localized feature. By His personal feature, He is always present in His abode known as Kṛṣṇaloka or Vaikuṇṭhaloka in the spiritual sky. And by His impersonal feature He is present as impersonal Brahman effulgence. You will find in the //Bhagavad-gītā// also, //brahmaṇo ahaṁ pratiṣṭhā:// "I am the source of Brahman effulgence." //Brahmaṇo ahaṁ pratiṣṭhā.// Similarly, in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is stated,

> yasya prabhā prabhavato jagadaṇḍa-koṭi-
> koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam
> tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.40]

Govinda, Kṛṣṇa, He has got rays from His body. Just like you see the sunshine. The sunshine is the rays of the body of the sun-god. That you are seeing every day. You can see only the sun globe. But if you have got power, as you are trying to go to the moon planet, similarly, if some day if you get such scientific power and you can go through the sun planet, then you can see there sun-god. It is not imagination; it is a fact. Just like in every planet there is a predominating man. Take for example in this planet, the president of United States is to be a predominating personality. Similarly, in every planet there is a predominating personality, and the predominating personality in the sun globe is called Vivasvān. The name is there in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. Kṛṣṇa says that "First of all I spoke this //Bhagavad-gītā, bhakti-yoga, imaṁ yogam,// to the sun-god Vivasvān." The name is there. Just like your president's name is Mr. Johnson or Ni..., or...?

**Devotee:**
Nixon.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nixon. Yes. [laughter] Hare Kṛṣṇa. So similarly, in every planet there is a president, and this president is called Vivasvān. //Vivasvān manave prāha.// And Vivasvān spoke this yoga system to his son Manu, the present Manu. He is present, the... The father of the mankind is called Manu. From Manu this word has come, "man," or //manuṣya.// So //vivasvān manave prāha manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt:// "And Manu spoke to his son, Ikṣvāku." //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. In this way, by disciplic succession, either from the father to the son or from the spiritual master to the disciple, this knowledge is coming. Just like you know your forefather's name---suppose the grandfather of your grandfather. How do you know? By the //paramparā// system. Your grandfather's grandfather was known to his son, then his son, then his son, then his son, then your father, then you are. You cannot know directly; you have to know by the step. Similarly, you have to know the previous personalities by this //paramparā,// disciplic succession. You cannot speculate how is your grandfather's grandfather. You have to hear from your father or grandfather. That is the process. Similarly, you cannot imagine what is God. You have to hear from the disciplic succession who is coming from God. Then you will understand what is God. So that is the personal understanding of God.

Then impersonal understanding of God, just Brahman... //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma:// "Everything is standing on Brahman." Just like materially you understand: everything in the material manifestation, that is depending on the sunshine. The trees, as soon as there is sunshine, there is green foliage. As soon as there is no sunshine, there is no leaves, no greenness. So everything is depending on sunshine. The sunshine is also depending on Kṛṣṇa; therefore Kṛṣṇa is the original cause of all causes. That is Kṛṣṇa realization. You can realize Him personally, you can realize Him impersonally, and you can realize Him localized. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati:// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]] "Arjuna, that Supreme Personality of Godhead is situated, localized, in everyone's heart." Just like the sun globe is there, and the sun globe's effulgence is the impersonal representation of the sun-god. And suppose there are five millions of people standing in the sunshine, and everyone will see the sun is above his head. That is localized. You go five thousand miles away and ask your friend here, "Where is the sun?" Your friend will say that "It is on my head." And you will also see it is on your head. As it is materially possible, why not spiritually? So spiritually, Kṛṣṇa is within your heart. Simply you have to realize it.

How you can realize it? That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. If you chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// even if you do not realize, simply if you come here and chant and dance, //puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ,// because you are chanting and hearing, you are getting piousness; you are becoming purified---simply by joining. This temple is situated just to give you facility for your purification. Why don't you take advantage? I am very glad that you have all come, and it will be further our enjoyment and pleasure if you come and join. Please come here, join here. We have got very nice arrangement. We supply //prasādam,// we have got dancing, we have got chanting. Why you should deny it? [laughter] And if you join us, then gradually you realize what you are, what is God, what is this world, what is your relationship. Then your life becomes successful. You'll not be confused. You will understand what is real life. Simply by the spell of the material qualities you have become covered. But if you come here, if you hear and chant, then gradually... Kṛṣṇa is within you. He is sitting within your heart as a friend, not as an enemy. Kṛṣṇa is always your friend. //Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. You are searching out friends to talk with, to joke with, to love. Kṛṣṇa is sitting there for that purpose. If you love Kṛṣṇa, if you make friendship with Kṛṣṇa, if you love Kṛṣṇa, then your life will be successful. You haven't got to search out any other friend. The friend is already there. Either you are a boy or a girl, you will find a nice friend within yourself. That is yoga system, when you realize this friend.

So this friend is so nice, as soon as you become little inclined to hear about Him, //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ//---about Kṛṣṇa, not any other nonsense talks, simply about Kṛṣṇa---then Kṛṣṇa will be so pleased. He is within you. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ, hṛdy antaḥ sthaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. //Hṛt// means heart. //Antaḥ stho. Antaḥ stho// means "who is sitting within your heart." So //hṛdy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi.// We cannot see Kṛṣṇa, we cannot realize Kṛṣṇa---He is sitting within my heart---due to my contamination, //abhadrāṇi.// We have contaminated ourself with so many material desires. That is contamination. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is pure. Just like you take the sea water---it is pure. But as soon as it touches the land, it becomes impure, cloudy, muddy. Similarly, your consciousness, because you are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, is as clear as Kṛṣṇa, but due to this contamination with this material world, you have contacted the muddy things of three qualities: ignorance, passion, and goodness. So if you hear about Kṛṣṇa, these muddy things will be precipitated and they will be separated. Then, gradually, as the..., proportionately, as you clear these muddy qualities of the material nature, you come to pure consciousness.

First of all, you come to the goodness of consciousness. When you come to the goodness of consciousness, then you become a //brāhmaṇa.// What is the quality of //brāhmaṇa? Satya śama dama titikṣa ārjava, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. You come to the brahminical position, or stage. Then you will be truthful. First thing is truthful, //satyam. Śamam,// self-controlled; //damam,// the senses are controlled, mind is controlled. We are practically driven by the uncontrolled mind and uncontrolled senses. So when you come to the brahminical position, then your senses become controlled, your mind becomes controlled. Just like our students, all our students, how they are controlling? They are also born in your country. They are also Americans. None of my students are Indian. But how they are controlling illicit sex life? How they are controlling not to drink, not to take any intoxicants? How they are controlling not to take part in gambling? No illicit sex, no meat-eating. You are born eating meat. How they have given up? Because they have come to the stage of this brahminical understanding---//satya, śama, dama, titikṣa. Titikṣa// means tolerance. Suppose any one of my students was practiced to all these habits and by my word, if they have given up, they may be feeling some inconvenience. Still, they are tolerating. That should be done, tolerating. //Titikṣa, ārjava,// simplicity. They have taken my words by simple faith, simplicity, //ārjava, sad-lata// [?]. Then //jñānam,// then their understanding what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness; //vijñānam,// they are applying in practical life. //Āstikyam,// they are believing in the //śāstras,// in the Vedic literature. //Brahma-karma svabhāva-jam:// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]] "This is the nature of a //brāhmaṇa.//" Therefore, as soon as I see, I give him the sacred thread: "Yes. You are now recognized //brāhmaṇa.//"

Then, from this //brāhmaṇa// stage you have to become a Vaiṣṇava. That is transcendental stage. Simply by hearing... This chanting and hearing will raise you, higher and higher stages of life. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā. Naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. By this process, when your contamination will be almost clear, not completely clear, almost clear... Completely clear is not possible because we are in this material world, we have got this material body. But //Bhāgavata// says, "Even it is not completely cured, almost cured," //nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā... Nityam// means daily, regularly. //Bhāgavata-sevayā. Bhāgavata// means in relationship with Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa. So these boys are engaged in reading //Bhāgavatam,// in reading //Bhagavad-gītā// and other literatures which gives them knowledge about Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And //bhāgavata// means the devotee. They have accepted a spiritual master, as a good devotee, so they are serving, //bhāgavata-sevayā.// Then //bhagavati...// Then, by this process, he becomes fixed up in the transcendental loving service of God. In this way, //evaṁ prasanna-manaso// [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]? "By this way, he becomes jolly." Because jolliness is my original consciousness, but due to my material contamination I am not jolly, I am morose, I am full of anxiety. So as soon as you become freed from this material contamination... //Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ.// How you can become such happy mood? //Bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ:// by the //bhakti-yoga// process.

> evaṁ prasanna-manaso
> bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ
> bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ
> mukta-saṅgasya jāyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]

//Bhāgavata-tattva...// This is a science to understand God. Just like you have got different departmental sciences to understand perfectly a subject matter, similarly, this //bhāgavata-tattva,// this truth of God, you can understand by practicing this //bhakti-yoga,// and you become jolly. [laughter] Yes. This is practical.

So this is a great science. It is a great science. Don't be confused and frustrated. Take this. Take this. It is very easy. You come to this temple and chant and dance and take //prasādam// and be jolly and be happy.

Thank you very much. That's all. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Now chant again. [end]
