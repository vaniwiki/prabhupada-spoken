**Prabhupāda:**
Now today this function of installing Deity, this is authorized. Just like several times I have given the example that when you put your mails in a box in the street, because it is written there U.S. Mail, you know that it is authorized box. And if you put your letters within this box, it will surely reach the destination. The post office will work. So there is no difference between the huge post office building and that small box because it is authorized. Similarly, the difference between idol worship and Deity worship is like that. Unless authorized process is accepted, it is idol worship. That is the general rule. If somebody thinks that "There is a box, red and blue, on the street. Why shall I go to that box? Let me have similar box at my door and it will be cleared by the postman because it is blue and red," that will not be so. Because the box which you put at your door, that is not authorized.

Similarly, we have to worship the Deity according to the authorized system. Just like in our //Gauḍīya-sampradāya// there is authorized system by the Gosvāmīs and there is a big book which is called //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.// So everything is stated there, how the Vaiṣṇava family should have their all function... It is called //Vaiṣṇava-smṛti. Śruti// and //smṛti.// So we have to follow this regulation of the //śruti, Vedas,// and //smṛti. Smṛti// means derived from the //Vedas.// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says, //śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-pāñcarātrikī-vidhiṁ vinā, aikāntikī harer bhaktir utpātāyaiva kalpate// [Brs. 1.2.101]. Without following the rules and regulations of Vedic injunctions, without reference to the regulative principles mentioned in different //smṛtis,// without reference to the //Purāṇas// and without reference to the //pāñcarātrikī-vidhī...//

The //pāñcarātrikī-vidhī// means it is a special concession for this age. //Vaidika-vidhī// and //pāñcarātrikī-vidhī. Vaidika-vidhī// is very authorized, but this //Vaidika-vidhī// is specially meant for those who are highly elevated brāhmaṇas. In this age it is accepted as a fact by the //śāstras, kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.// In this age nobody is actually bona fide //brāhmaṇas// by birth. Formerly they used to be. The family tradition, the //garbhādhāna// system, the //saṁskāras// were strictly followed; therefore a son born of a //brāhmaṇa// father was accepted as a //brāhmaṇa,// not immediately, but going through the process. But in this age because it is very difficult to find out a person who is born of a qualified brāhmaṇa, therefore //Nārada Pañcarātra// is there. So these Gosvāmīns, Rūpa Gosvāmī specially recommends, //śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-pañc...// [Brs. 1.2.101]. Either you follow the principles of //śruti, Vedas,// followed by //smṛti, purāṇādi,// or you follow the //pāñcarātrikī-vidhī.// The //pāñcarātrikī-vidhī...// Just like we are introducing in this temple for worshiping Deity, but actually the Deity can be worshiped by the bona fide //brāhmaṇas.//

There was agitation in India, perhaps you know, that Gandhi stamped some persons as //Harijana. Harijana.// They were coming from the //bhaṅgīs. Bhaṅgīs// means sweepers or the cleaners of the toilet room. So Gandhi accepted them. The government was creating, British government was creating faction between high caste, low caste. So Gandhi thought that, "I shall make these //bhaṅgīs// and //camars// as //Harijana,// as great devotees." But simply by rubberstamping, how one can become devotee? That is not possible. Without going the //pāñcarātrikī-vidhī,// they remain the same unclean drunkard and the all nonsense habits. And simply by stamping rubberstamping, //Harijana?// No. Here what we are doing, it is not rubberstamping. It is actually training according to the //pāñcarātrikī-vidhī.// We are training our boys to become //brāhmaṇas,// to refrain from four kinds of sinful activities, to take bath, to take this, take that. And above all, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Ceto-darpaṇa-marjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]], cleansing of all sinful activities. So in this way //Harijana// can be made, but not that you pick up somebody nonsense and rubberstamp this "//Harijana.//" No. There must be process.

There is no hindrance for anyone to become //Harijana. Harijana// means God's person or devotee. Hari means God, Kṛṣṇa, and //jana// means His person. Just like we have got here government servant, special, or ordinary person. So //Harijana// means the servants of the Supreme Lord. So that is not ordinary thing. There is no harm to create //Harijana// by regular process, but you cannot make //Harijana// simply by stamping. //Bhagavad-gītā// says, equal opportunity for everyone. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśrityā ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. Low-class born birth is understood due to sinful activities. Low-class birth, animal birth. Sinful activities. But Kṛṣṇa says, //pāpa-yonayaḥ,// born in sinful families, never mind. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśrityā...// If he becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious by bona fide process, //māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśrityā. Vyapāśrityā// means bona fide process. Not an imitation, bona fide. And bona fide means as they are depicted, as they are described, as they are enjoined in the authorized //śāstra// like //śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-pañca...// [Brs. 1.2.101]. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśrityā ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ.// Never mind in whatever family one is born, sinful family, never mind. //Striyaḥ śūdrās tathā vaiśyaḥ,// including woman and //śūdras// and //vaiśyas,// they are considered as less intelligent. They are considered as less intelligent. Therefore, according to Vedic system, a boy born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, he is allowed all the //saṁskāras,// reformatory, purificatory process, but the girl is not. Why? Now, because a girl has to follow her husband. So if her husband is //brāhmaṇa,// automatically she becomes //brāhmaṇa.// There is no need of separate reformation. And by chance she may be married with a person who is not a //brāhmaṇa,// then what is the use of making her a //brāhmaṇa?// That is the general method. So therefore the, even born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, a woman is taken as woman, not as //brāhmaṇa.// But Kṛṣṇa says, "Never mind. Even if she is woman, even she is //śūdra,// even she is //vaiśya,// or any other, I mean to say, family born in, never mind." //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśrityā// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]], if anyone is bona fidely made Kṛṣṇa conscious, //te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim,// so his way is open to the path of Vaikuṇṭha, //parāṁ gatim. Kiṁ punar brāhmaṇāḥ puṇyā bhaktā rājarṣayas tathā// [[books:bg:9:33|[Bg. 9.33]]].

So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice, it opens the door of highest perfectional platform for everyone provided he follows the rules and regulations. That's all. That is the only condition. Otherwise, if simply by imitating, if somebody thinks, "Oh, I can become a..." like that. "If such and such person can become, I can do..." No. That is warned by Rūpa Gosvāmī,

> śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-
> pāñcarātrikī-vidhīṁ vinā
> aikāntikī harer bhaktir
> utpatayaiva kalpate
> [Brs. 1.2.101]

If we simply imitate, oh, that will not do. So do not try to imitate, follow the simple rules and regulations, it is very nice, and above all, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. You'll become purified. Without being purified you cannot touch Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. In the //Vedas// it is stated, "Without becoming Brahman you cannot approach Brahman." Just like without becoming fire you cannot approach fire. Because the inconsistency of temperature. It will burn. Just like here is fire, and I am feeling temperature, but the fire flames within the fire, they do not feel because the temperature is the same. Similarly, without becoming Brahman, without understanding oneself, realizing himself, nobody can... Kṛṣṇa is the Parambrahman. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Puruṣaṁ śāśvatam,// therefore one has to keep himself very purified; otherwise you cannot touch Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. It is fire, so you have to become fire. And how to become fire? Fire, you are also fire, but now you are covered fire, covered by this material body. Therefore you have to spiritualize this body by purificatory process. The same example, just like the iron rod, it is iron, but you put into the fire. It becomes warm, warmer, warmer, then red hot, then it is fire. Similarly, by this process, chanting process, by regulative process, you are becoming warmer, warmer, warmer, warmer. And when you fully become red hot warm, then your body is as good as Kṛṣṇa's. So we have to keep ourself always in the fire of Kṛṣṇa consciousness; then everything is all right. [laughs] Otherwise, it will become dull and it will be simply idol worship. That's all. That is the difference between idol worship and Deity worship. If there is no life, then it is idol worship, hedonism. And when there is life, feeling, "Where is Kṛṣṇa? Here is Kṛṣṇa. Oh, I have to serve Kṛṣṇa, I have to dress Him, I have to serve Rādhārāṇī, She is here. Oh, I must do it very nicely. And as far as possible decorate Her to the best capacity." In this way, if you always feel Kṛṣṇa conscious, then you are fire. The same example, keeping with the fire. And if you think it is a brass-made doll, I mean to say, idol... //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. If you think this is a brass-made idol, then it will remain a brass-made idol to you forever. But if you elevate yourself to higher platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then Kṛṣṇa, this Kṛṣṇa, will talk with you. This Kṛṣṇa will talk with you.

There is a Vaṁsīdāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, he was talking with his Deity. And Kṛṣṇa... Just like Madana-mohana, He was talking with Sanātana Gosvāmī. Madana-mohana... Sanātana Gosvāmī at that time had no temple; he was hanging his Deity on the tree. So Madana-mohana was talking with him, "Sanātana, you are bringing all these dry //capatis,// and it is stale, and you don't give Me even little salt. How can I eat?" Sanātana Gosvāmī said, "Sir, where shall I go? Whatever I get I offer You. You kindly accept. I cannot move, old man." You see. So Kṛṣṇa had to eat that. [chuckles] Because the //bhakta// is offering He cannot refuse. //Ye māṁ bhaktyā prayacchati.// Real thing is //bhakti.// What you can offer to Kṛṣṇa? Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. What you have got? What is your value? And what is the value of your things? It is nothing. Therefore real thing is //bhaktyā,// real thing is your feeling. "Kṛṣṇa, kindly take it. I have no qualification. I am most rotten, fallen, but [begins to cry] I have brought this thing for you. Please take it." This will be accepted. Don't be puffed up. Always be careful. You are dealing with Kṛṣṇa. That is my request. Thank you very much. [end]
