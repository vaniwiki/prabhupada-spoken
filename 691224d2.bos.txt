====== Discussion about New Vrindaban Gurukula ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...form a committee from education in your...

**Hayagrīva:**
They have to be taught reading, and for this they have primers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Primary readings.

**Hayagrīva:**
And this is all right to use?

**Prabhupāda:**
Because we haven't got any books yet.

**Hayagrīva:**
What about taking the primers and changing the names of the people to people like Satyabhāmā and give them spiritual names. Would that be nice?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Pradyumna:**
//Hari-nāmāmṛtam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hayagrīva:**
All right. Arithmetic should be taught?

**Prabhupāda:**
Arithmetic? Yes. That is necessary.

**Hayagrīva:**
What about any history? World history or American history or American literature or English literature?

**Prabhupāda:**
American history. That's all. They are Americans. They should learn American history. Don't bother much.

**Hayagrīva:**
Any Indian history?

**Prabhupāda:**
Indian history, that... //Bhāgavata// is all right.

**Hayagrīva:**
//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
That Kurukṣetra battle. That's all. And there are many other stories in the //Bhāgavatam.// They are all historical.

**Hayagrīva:**
What about literatures? When they get older, of course. This would be for when they are older.

**Prabhupāda:**
Literature, we have got so many. //Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.//

**Hayagrīva:**
Any English literature, American literature, English literature?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Any... Some of the English literature, recognized.

**Hayagrīva:**
Any of the sciences at all?

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't think we require any science. What do you think?

**Hayagrīva:**
Biology?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
No.

**Hayagrīva:**
Geology, zoology, astronomy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Biology, you can teach them the evolution of the species from //Padma-Purāṇa,// 8,400,000's, one after another. Yes.

**Hayagrīva:**
What about astronomy? Anything like that? No. Okay. Any animal husbandry they can learn out there. Animal husbandry they will learn...

**Prabhupāda:**
That they will learn practically, cow keeping.

**Hayagrīva:**
At what age should they be taught to cook //prasādam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hayagrīva:**
At what age should they be taught to cook?

**Prabhupāda:**
After twelve years.

**Hayagrīva:**
After twelve. And you think they can be taught typing, for instance? A skill like typing and how to use typewriter?

**Prabhupāda:**
Does it require all? Well, just this knowledge is required.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Whatever is practical.

**Hayagrīva:**
And the only other... Oh, how old should they be before Deity worship, they do Deity worship?

**Prabhupāda:**
Just after ten years.

**Hayagrīva:**
After ten years? Then they can do Deity worship?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hayagrīva:**
That's Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity worship.

**Prabhupāda:**
Any Deity. Or worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

**Hayagrīva:**
Well, the boys are keeping Deities now, aren't they?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes.

**Hayagrīva:**
He said after ten.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they are keeping as plaything now, not they are regularly worshiping.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
He means in the temple they can officiate, do //ārati// and things...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hayagrīva:**
Oh, I see. So from just very small they can keep Deities.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes. As small as they want to.

**Hayagrīva:**
And you suggested... I have it written down somewhere. You suggested a certain number of hours for their school, about five hours or four hours a day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Three hours in the morning, two hours in the evening. That's all. Not at a stretch. Morning, evening. And in the noon they should take their //prasādam,// take little rest.

**Hayagrīva:**
Because our literatures are a little difficult to read...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You have to make some suitable literature.

**Hayagrīva:**
Something... When they can do that, then they can read //Bhagavad-gītā.// They try a little, but it's very difficult to begin.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Hayagrīva:**
They cannot begin.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [end]
