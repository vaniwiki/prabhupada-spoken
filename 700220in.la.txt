**Prabhupāda:**
//Anyad āhur...// What is the next //śloka?//

**Devotees:**
[Śrīla Prabhupāda chants with the devotees]

> vidyāṁ cāvidyāṁ ca yas
> tad vedobhayaṁ saha
> avidyayā mṛtyuṁ tīrtvā
> vidyayāmṛtam aśnute

> andhaṁ tamaḥ praviśanti
> ye 'sambhūtim upāsate
> tato bhūya iva te tamo
> ya u sambhūtyāṁ ratāḥ

> anyad evāhuḥ sambhavād
> anyad āhur asambhavāt
> iti śuśruma dhīrāṇāṁ
> ye nas tad vicacakṣire

**Prabhupāda:**
So today is a special function day. Some of our advanced students, they're accepting the renounced order of life. First of all, one of our students, Kīrtanānanda Brahmacārī, he was offered when I was in India, Vṛṇdāvana, in Janmāṣṭamī day he was offered this //sannyāsa// order in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. Similarly, here we have got also Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple. There is no difference between Rādhā-Dāmodara temple and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple. So we postponed this to be held on the Janmāṣṭamī day at New Vrindaban, but by some reason we are now postponing to go there, and we have decided to perform this function here. And I am very glad that we are all present. Now, this //sannyāsa mantra// should be studied very seriously and we shall chant this //mantra// after the regular function. Especially those who are accepting the //sannyāsa// order, they should try to understand the import of this important //mantra.// The import of this important //mantra// especially is that, as we prohibit several things during ordinary initiation, just like no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling, similarly there are many no's in accepting the //sannyāsa// order. Especially meat... not meat-eating, mating. And politics. If we remain in the materialistic order of life, then this //sannyāsa// order will be a facility for cheating. That responsibility you must have. That is the meaning of the //sannyāsa// order. //San, sat-nyās.// Renounced order means one has to renounce everything for Kṛṣṇa's sake. So this //mantra// will be chanted after these formal //mantras, apavitraḥ pavitro vā,// and then you'll change your dress, and then //yajña// will take place, then //saṅkirtana// movement, your business. So you have got all these? Now chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. You all chant. [devotees chant //japa//] //Namo apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā.// You know all this or I shall have to repeat? Or you say. [devotees repeat:]

> namo apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bahyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ
> śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu

Again take. [repeats verse] Again. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [repeats again] //Vande 'ham...// [recites //maṅgalācarana// prayers, devotees repeating] Now take your... Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Open your dress. Later on when you come.

**Viṣṇujana:**
The //mantra's// here on this sheet?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That's all right. You first of all dress. Why...? For others there is no garland?

**Karandhara:**
Yes. //Ārati.// Should we have //ārati?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, all right. Finish //ārati.// In the meantime, you dress. Take that garland. So I shall give you. Give me that cloth. No, no. That... First of all cloth give me. This cloth I'll deliver you. No, no. This cloth. Yes. This is your cloth?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Shall we put the garlands on now, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Bring it and... No. Garland I shall give later on when you will dress, come out. I will give you. Like this. Yes. Dress yourself and come. Brahmānanda? You come. There shall be no shirt. Open. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. Now you can perform your daily program. Yes. [break]

**Dayānanda:**
Should we offer the garland? [Karandhara leading //maṅgalācarana// prayers and doing fire sacrifice] [indistinct] //upāsitām.//

**Prabhupāda:**
You can read the translation.

**Dayānanda:**
Translation: "I shall cross over the insurmountable ocean of darkness of ignorance simply by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Mukunda who gives all kinds of liberations and who is worshiped by many great previous //ācāryas.//" Purport: "There are sixty-four kinds of rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of which to accept the uniform dress of a //tridaṇḍi sannyāsī// is also an important item. One who accepts this order of life, surely by rendering service unto the Supreme Lord becomes eligible to cross over the insurmountable ocean of ignorance. All previous sages used to accept such order of life, and later //ācārya,// Viṣṇu Svāmī, adopted this order of life and specifically stressed on this procedure in order to achieve firm conviction in the matter of devotional service. Those who are unalloyed devotees, they add one more staff along with the original three. This extra one is representation of the living entity. There is another sect who are known as //ekaṇḍa// sect. They misunderstand the purpose of //tridaṇḍa// and by such deviation, Śivaswami //sannyāsīs,// who claim to belong to the Viṣṇu Svāmī sect, turn to be impersonalists and follow the footsteps of Śaṅkarācārya, accepting only the //ekaṇḍa.// Instead of naming themselves out of the 108 names of Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs,// this Śivaswami sect accepts ten names of the //sannyāsī,// following Śaṅkarācārya. Lord Caitanya, although in terms of the then practice accepted //ekaṇḍi// [sic] //sannyāsa// order, but His acceptance of //tridaṇḍi sannyāsa// is understood. This //mantra// was first chanted by a learned //brāhmaṇa// of Avantīpura after being very much disgusted in this materialistic way of life. This happened long, long years ago because it is mentioned in the //Bhāgavatam// which was composed by Vyāsadeva at least five thousand years ago. So it is to be concluded therefore that this //tridaṇḍi sannyāsī// order is coming down since a long time. Since a time long, long years ago. And within five hundred years of time, Lord Caitanya adopted this order of life. In the latest years, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda adopted it personally and made many of his disciples //tridaṇḍi sannyāsīs.// We are also following his footsteps. In the purport of this //mantra// is that the //ekaṇḍi sannyāsī// is devoid of //parātma niṣṭha,// which is explained above. In other words, impersonalists..." On the first page it says, an explanation of //parātma// is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is given in the English synonyms. So it says, "We are also following his footsteps. And the purport of this //mantra// is that the //ekaṇḍi sannyāsī// is devoid of //parātma niṣṭha,// which is explained above." So that is right, Prabhupāda, that the impersonalist is devoid of the Supreme Personality of Godhead?

**Prabhupāda:**
They have no idea. They say that we can imagine an idea. According to impersonalists, they say //sādhakānām hitārthaya brahmaṇo rūpa kalpanaḥ.// Because we cannot concentrate our mind in impersonal therefore they say, "Imagine some form." They think that Kṛṣṇa is imagination. Yes. [laughter] That is their Māyāvāda. Kṛṣṇa was personally present and He killed all the demons. Still, these demons says imagination. That is demonic. Therefore we do not agree with them.

**Dayānanda:**
"In other words, impersonalists cannot have any faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead and they prefer to merge into the impersonal Brahman effulgence. In the //Śrīmad-Bhagavatam// we do not find any mention of //ekaṇḍa sannyāsa.// This //tridaṇḍa sannyāsa// is accepted therefore as standard. Lord Caitanya accepts //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// as the supreme authority. Under these circumstances, persons who accept Lord Caitanya as //ekaṇḍi sannyāsī// are mistaken. So following the footsteps of Lord Caitanya still the //tridaṇḍi sannyāsīs// are in existence. Keeping the sacred thread and //śikhā// intact, distinct from the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// Māyāvādī //ekaṇḍi sannyāsīs,// who give up the sacred thread and //śikhā.// They have no inclination to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Being very much disgusted by the materialistic way of life, they do not understand the purpose of the //sannyāsa// order. But those who are strictly followers of the Vaiṣṇava principles, they do not accept the Māyāvādī way of //sannyāsa.// In the sect of Lord Caitanya, the most venerable learned scholar known as Gadādhara Paṇḍita Gosvāmī accepted this //tridaṇḍi sannyāsa// order and he offered this facility to his disciple known as Śrī Madhva-upādhyāya. This Madhvācārya is the origin of the Vallabhācārya sect. One of the Six Gosvāmīs, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, who is the authority of Vaiṣṇava regulations, was initiated by another //tridaṇḍi sannyāsī// known as Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī. Therefore this //sannyāsī// order is completely in pursuance of Vaiṣṇava authority."

**Prabhupāda:**
So that //daṇḍa// you can take. Your //daṇḍa// take. You can take, come on. His name is there? No.

**Devotee:**
No.

**Viṣṇujana:**
You know which one is which?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. According to the size we have made. So which size he is I do not know. I... That's your?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's your. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa. Now chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Dance. [break---//prema-dhvani//] So, this is now formal accepting of //sannyāsa,// but real //sannyāsa// purpose will be fulfilled when you'll be able to induce the people of the world dancing like you. That is real //sannyāsa.// This formal dress is not //sannyāsa.// Real //sannyāsa// is when you can induce other people to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and they dance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Devotees:**
Jaya!

**Prabhupāda:**
If you can turn one man to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then your going back to Godhead, back to home, guaranteed. That is real purpose of //sannyāsa.//

Thank you very much. [end]
