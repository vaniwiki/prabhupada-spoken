**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa is lion to the demons, and He's a lamb to the devotees. [laughter] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// So the atheist, they say that "We have not seen Kṛṣṇa." Yes. You'll see Kṛṣṇa as lion when He'll ultimately come and capture you, "Ow!" [laughter] That is death. Atheist will see Kṛṣṇa as death, and theist, devotee, will see Kṛṣṇa as lover. Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Nama om bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [aside:] You sit down properly, back side. Yes. [chants //Īśopaniṣad// 1–10 with devotees] Anyone can explain the third verse? //Kurvann eveha karmāṇi jijīviṣec chataṁ samāḥ.// Who will explain, please stand up. Nobody? [laughs] How is that? Huh? Yes?

**Devotee (1):**
[explaining text 2] This explains that the human form of life is meant for realizing our spiritual nature.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I wanted that //śloka, kurvann eva.// That is 2, yes. That's all right. So anyone will explain this,

> kurvann eveha karmāṇi
> jijīviṣec chataṁ samāḥ
> evaṁ tvayi nānyatheto 'sti
> na karma lipyate nare

So you should try to read the explanation, these word meanings. So //kurvann eveha karmāṇi jijīviṣec chataṁ samāḥ. Samāḥ// means years. You can live hundreds of years if you understand the philosophy of life. Otherwise, what is the use of living? The trees are also living for five hundred years, for thousands years. There is one tree in San Francisco... What is that wood?

**Devotee (1):**
Redwood.

**Prabhupāda:**
Redwood. No. There is some wood, I forget. Crossing bridge. Anyway, they told me that this tree is standing for seven thousand years. So the trees are also living, and you are also living. You are trying to live. Whenever there is question of death, you resist. That means you do not want to die. That is natural sequence. So here it is said that why should you live? Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //ke lāgi āche, āchi...:// "Why I am living? I could not achieve love of Godhead. Then what is the use of my living?" He's lamenting. Narottama dāsa //kena na lāgilā māriyā. Kena vā ahcaya prāṇa kichuka lāgiyā// [?]. He said, "Why I am living? What is the purpose of my living? What is the ultimate happiness?" [end]
