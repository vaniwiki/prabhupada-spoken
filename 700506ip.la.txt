[devotees chant Invocation and first two //mantras//]

**Prabhupāda:**
Again from the beginning. [devotees repeat] Again. [devotees repeat] This is very important verse. //Evaṁ tvayi nānyathe..., nānyathā ato asti na karma lipyate nare.// If you know it that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, in this way if you live for hundreds of years and do your duties, there will be no reaction. The very thing is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā: yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. Except working for Kṛṣṇa, any work will bind you, good or bad. If you do good work, you'll have to enjoy, so-called enjoyment. And if you do bad work, then you have to suffer. But if you work for Kṛṣṇa, there is no such reaction. //Na karma lipyate nare// All right. Then next verse. [devotees repeat word for word]

> asuryā nāma te lokā
> andhena tamasāvṛtāḥ
> tāṁs te pretyābhigacchanti
> ye ke cātma-hano janāḥ

[repeats] Now you try it. [devotees chant] Yes. Again.

**Devotees:**
//Asuryā nāma te loka...//

**Prabhupāda:**
The first word is //asuryā.// This //y-ā. Asuryā.//

**Devotees:**

> asuryā nāma te lokā
> andhena tamasāvṛtāḥ
> tāṁs te pretyābhigacchanti
> ye ke cātma-hano janāḥ

**Prabhupāda:**
"The killer of the soul, whoever he may be, must enter into the planets known as the worlds of the faithless, full of darkness and ignorance." [Prabhupāda leads devotees in //śloka//] Now repeat again. Thank you. Again from the beginning. [devotees chant Invocation and verses 1–3] Thank you. [break] Again.

**Devotees:**

> anejad ekaṁ manaso javīyo
> nainad devā āpnuvan pūrvam arṣat
> tad dhāvato 'nyān atyeti tiṣṭhat
> tasminn apo mātariśvā dadhāti

**Prabhupāda:**
"The Personality of Godhead, although fixed in His abode, is more swift than the mind and can overcome all others running. The powerful demigods cannot approach Him. Although in one place, He has control over those who supply the air, rain. He surpasses all in excellence." This is also confirmed in //Brahma-saṁhitā: goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. Kṛṣṇa, although He is always in Goloka Vṛndāvana, He has nothing to do. He is simply enjoying in the company of His associates, the //gopīs// and the cowherds boy, His mother, His father. Free, completely free. And those who are associates, they are still more free. Because when the associates are in danger, Kṛṣṇa has got some anxiety how to save them, but the associates, they have no anxiety. "Oh, there is Kṛṣṇa." Just see. [chuckles] The associates, they have no anxiety. Any, anything happening, you will read in the //Kṛṣṇa// book---so many dangers. The boys, along with Kṛṣṇa, they used to go every day with their calves and cows and play in the forest on the bank of the Yamunā, and Kaṁsa will send some demon to destroy them. So you have seen, you will see also pictures. So they'll enjoy simply because they are so much confident. That is spiritual life. //Avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa viśvāsa pālana.// This strong faith, that "Any dangerous condition, Kṛṣṇa will save me," this is surrender.

There are six phases of surrender. The first thing is that we should accept which is favorable for devotional service; we shall reject anything which is unfavorable to devotional service. And the next is that to introduce oneself with the associates of the Lord. Just like Kṛṣṇa has got so many associates, you can... That will, of course... Not artificially. When you are advanced you'll understand what is your relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Then if you introduce yourself with that association, then the next stage is confidence that "Kṛṣṇa will give me protection." Actually, He is giving protection to everyone. That is a fact. But in //māyā// we think that we are protecting ourself, we are feeding ourself. No. That's not the fact.

> prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
> guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
> ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
> kartāham iti manyate
> [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]

To the devotees, Kṛṣṇa takes charge Himself, and to the ordinary living entities, the charge is taken by //māyā. Māyā// is also Kṛṣṇa's agent. Just like good citizens, they are taken care of by the government directly, and the criminals, they are taken care of by the government through the prison department, through the criminal department. They are also taken care of. In the prison house the government takes care that the prisoners not in uncomfortable---they get sufficient food; if they're diseased they give hospital treatment---every care is there, but under punishment. Similarly, we in this material world, there is care certainly, but in, in a punishment way. If you do this, then slap. If you do this, then kick. If you do this, then this... This is going on. This is called threefold miseries. But under the spell of //māyā// we are thinking that this kicking of //māyā,// this slapping of //māyā,// this thrashing of //māyā// is very nice. You see? This is called //māyā.// And as soon as you get into Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then Kṛṣṇa takes care of you. //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Kṛṣṇa, as soon as you surrender, Kṛṣṇa's immediate word is, "I take care of you. I save you from all, from all sinful reaction." There are heaps of sinful reaction in our life, for so many life after life in this material world. And as soon as you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, immediately Kṛṣṇa takes care of you and He manages how to adjust all the sinful reactions. //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mā śucaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa says, "Don't hesitate." If you think that "Oh, I have committed so many sinful activities. How Kṛṣṇa will save me?" No. Kṛṣṇa is all-powerful. He can save you. Your business is to surrender unto Him, and without any reservation dedicate your life for His service, and thus you'll become saved.

Now kindly chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant. [//kīrtana//] [end]
