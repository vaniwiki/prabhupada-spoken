**Prabhupāda:**
//Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// Where is Hayagrīva prabhu? Oh, that's all right. So you have to construct a temple there like this.

**Hayagrīva:**

Eh?

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. So you like this? This chandelier? //Śrī gurave prāṇa sadece goura sampad setuce// [?]. This is, this is a song by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. He says that one who has dedicated his life for Lord Caitanya, he sees everything belongs to Lord Caitanya. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Now //mantra.// [devotees chant //Īśopaniṣad, Mantra// 5] Thank you. "The Supreme Lord walks and does not walk. He is far away, but he is very near as well. He is within everything and again He is outside of everything." This is the process of understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He walks and does not walk. Just like crude example I give you, that the sun and, at noontime, it is on your head and somebody walking eastern side or western side, he also sees the sun is also walking with him. Long ago, about forty years ago, when I was householder, my second son, he was four years old. He was walking with me, and he said, "Oh, father, why the moon is coming with us?" This is very intelligent. Yes. So similarly, if a material object can walk so swift... You have seen. You are going on aeroplane or train, you'll see the moon or sun is going with you. So how it is not possible that Kṛṣṇa cannot walk? Although He's situated... But you ask your friend, "Where is the sun? Where is the moon?" He'll say, "Oh, it is on my head." Similarly, //goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. Kṛṣṇa, although He is in Vṛndāvana, Goloka Vṛndāvana, enjoying pastimes with the associates, He is everywhere, according to the position, shape, form, activities. Everywhere. Therefore it is said here that Supreme Lord walks and does not walk. He does not go from His abode. He is fully enjoying. But at the same time, everywhere He is. Everywhere walking. Just like we offer foodstuff. So do not think that Kṛṣṇa is not accepting. Kṛṣṇa is accepting, because He can spread His hand immediately if you offer something with devotion. //Tayā bhakty-upahṛtam aśnāmi.// Kṛṣṇa says, "Anyone offering Me, offering Me something with faith and love, I eat." People may ask, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is far away, in Goloka Vṛndāvana. How He eats? How He takes?" Oh, that is God. Yes, He eats. Yes, He takes. He walks; He does not walk. Immediately comes. But you must have the qualification to call Him. If you are actually a devotee, immediately Kṛṣṇa is present. Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu challenged devotee Prahlāda, "Where is your God? Do you think...?" The Prahlāda was looking to the column. "Oh, do you think your God is here? All right." He immediately broke. "Ahh!" Kṛṣṇa came. That is Kṛṣṇa.

So this is explained here. This is Vedic //mantra.// This is the proof, //Veda mantra.// Why we are attached to //Veda mantra? Veda mantra// is the proof of everything. Whatever is said in the //Vedas,// that is fact. Unless you take some axiomatic truth in that way, you cannot make progress. Just like in geometry there are so many axiomatic truths, we have to accept it. "A point has no length, no breadth." "Things equal to the same thing are equal to one another." These are axiomatic truths. Similarly the //Vedas,// they are truth. We have to accept. Just like I've given example in my book: The conchshell is the bone of an animal. So Vedic injunction is if you touch the bone of an animal, immediately you become impure and you have to take your bath. But here is a bone which is used in the Deity room. But you cannot argue, "Oh, you said that bone is impure. As soon as you touch it, you become impure. And you are putting into the Deity room?" No argument. You have to accept it. This is //Veda.// You cannot argue. Similarly, spiritual master's order, you have to accept. There is no argument. In this way you can make progress. //Sādhu śāstra guru vākya tinete kariyā aikya.// If we argue... //Na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet. Acintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet.// Things which are inconceivable by you, you cannot argue. Then it will be a failure. You have to accept that axiomatic truth. It is not dogmatic. It is not dogmatic in this sense, because our predecessor //ācāryas,// they accepted. What you are that you are arguing? So that is the proof. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. //Tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā.// If you argue, there is no conclusion. The argument will go on. You put some argument; I put some argument. That is not the process. //Śrutayo vibhinnā.// Scriptures, in different countries, different circumstances, different scriptures, they're also different. Then //tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā nāsau munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam.// And so far philosophical speculation is concerned, one philosopher is putting some theory, another philosopher putting some theory---there is contradiction. And unless you defy another philosopher, you cannot be a famous philosopher. That is the way of philosophical...

Then where, how to get real information? That is stated, that //dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyām.// The secret of religious process is lying in the cave or within the heart. So how to realize it? //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. You have to follow great personalities. Therefore we are trying to follow Lord Kṛṣṇa or Lord Caitanya. That is perfection. You have to take evidences from the //Vedas.// You have to follow the instruction. The success is sure. That's all.

Thank you very much. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
