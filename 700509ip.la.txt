**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Rūpānuga Prabhu, yes? Ekendra Prabhu also there? Hare Kṛṣṇa... Hare Kṛṣṇa... Kneel down, OM [devotees chant verses];

> yasmin sarvāṇi bhūtāny
> ātmaivābhūd vijānataḥ

> ekatvam anupaśyataḥ

"One who always sees all living entities as spiritual sparks, in quality one with the Lord, becomes a true knower of things. What is there as illusion or anxiety for him?" This realization is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There are different kinds of realization, but //ekatvam,// a qualitatively oneness, is always there. The //brahmavādi,// impersonalist, they think that we are cent percent one with the Lord or the Supreme Absolute Truth, but that is not a fact. If one is cent percent one with the Supreme Lord, then how he has come under the control of //māyā?// This question, they cannot answer.

So real identity is in the Vedic literature we find that just like the fire, big fire, and the sparks of the fire, they are of the same quality, but the small spark, when he goes out of the fire and falls elsewhere, then, at that time, its fiery quality becomes covered. So this covering becomes manifest according to different qualities. Just like the fire. If a fire spark, if it drops on the water, then it is, it assumes completely extinguished. Similarly, the living entity, although qualitatively the fire, with God, when it contacts the modes of ignorance, his spiritual quality becomes almost extinct. When he is on the land, not on the water, then there is something, heat. Similarly, when the living entity is in the //rajo-guṇa,// the quality of passion, there is some hope. And when the living entity is in goodness... Just like the same spark, if it drops on the grass, dry grass, then the same spark of fire ignites another fire, another blazing fire. Similarly, if one is in goodness, then he can create a spiritual association. Just like the same example, that the small spark of fire, if it falls in favorable circumstances, or in dry grass, then it can ignite fire.

So one has to come, therefore, to the platform of goodness in this material world. If one does not come to the platform of goodness... The platform of goodness is the brahminical qualification. That we are preaching. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to bring some men on the platform of goodness. The world requires it now. The world is need of some //brāhmaṇas,// qualified //brāhmaṇas.// Not that... You are being trained up to become qualified //brāhmaṇas.// So be always careful that you may not contact the quality of passion and ignorance. Passion and ignorance will induce you... //Kāma lobha,// lust and greediness. That is the sign of passion and ignorance. And when you are in goodness, then you can see things as they are. Then you can see yourself, that you are not matter; you are spirit soul. And if you make further advance, then you understand that "I am eternal part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, the fiery spark." So that //ekatvam anupaśyataḥ,// in this verse, //ekatvam,// that qualitatively one, not quantitatively. You are one with God qualitatively. You cannot be equal with God quantitatively. That //ekatvam.//

Thank you. Go on. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
