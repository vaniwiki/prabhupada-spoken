[Prabhupāda and devotees recite verses]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]].

"My dear king..." Śukadeva Gosvāmī is speaking to King Parīkṣit that "There are many subject matters for the persons who are materialistic." What sort of... Why they are engaged in so many topics? //Ātma-tattvam apaśyatām.// They do not see what is self-realization. //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. //Apaśyatām...// Generally, we do not know, we cannot see what is //ātmā// in these material eyes. Therefore the material scientists, they say that there is no soul, because they cannot see. With their instruments or with their knowledge it is not possible. //Apaśyatām.// They do not see it. Therefore we cannot believe our eyes. These eyes are not fit to see anything. It is under certain condition it gives us some impression. Otherwise... Therefore my Guru Mahārāja used to say that saintly persons should be seen not through the eyes, but through the ears. There are different processes of seeing. Don't believe that eyes are sufficient to see everything. No.

So //ātma-tattvam.// Those who are not interested what is self, for them there are different thousands and millions of topics. //Śrotavyādīni rājendra// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. Everyone is hearing. Somebody is talking, somebody is hearing... Even there is politics, conspiracy, there is also hearing and talking. But these talkings, thousands and thousands of talkings of different subject matter, for whom? For them who are unable to see what is soul. For them. //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. Why they have become so? //Gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām.// They want to be packed up within this material package and they have made their life in that way. //Gṛheṣu.// Just like ordinary man, he is interested with his apartment, family. //Dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣu// [[books:sb:2:1:4|[SB 2.1.4]]]. That //śloka// is next explained. He's interested with these things: how his nice apartment is maintained, how his wife is nicely dressed, how his children are nicely educated. So much. That's all. They are called //gṛhamedhī.// These words. //Gṛhamedhī.// So those who are married disciples, I will request them specifically that because you are married, you don't become //gṛhamedhī.// Then you lose this chance. I am getting reports from outside that some of our family disciples, they are not very much attending temples regularly. So if they do not attend temples, do not take to the service, then gradually they'll become //gṛhamedhī,// just like ordinary //karmīs.//

So as soon as one becomes //gṛhamedhī,// he becomes blind to see what is self-realization. So Śukadeva Gosvāmī says that those who are blind, those who have been encaged in the materialistic way of life, for them, there are thousands and thousands of topics to hear and to chant. But those who are seeing to the self... Self is one. //Ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti.// For them, one talk only about Kṛṣṇa. So I'll request you, all my beloved disciples present here, that don't turn to that point, //gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām.// Stick to this point, Kṛṣṇa. Then you'll be happy. Don't talk, create. Thousand... As soon as we go out of the scope of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there will be so many talks. And that will mislead you. That is //māyā.// And if you stick to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no secrecy, there is no duplicity, there is no diplomacy. One talk, Kṛṣṇa: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma... That will make you satisfied. //Yayātmā suprasīdati.// If you want actually happiness then you stick to these Kṛṣṇa consciousness topics. Don't bring in anything other, else. Then that will become //gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām, apaśyatām ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]].

So I am especially talking to my //sannyāsī// disciples, who are going out today on a great mission. Please stick to this principle-one-Kṛṣṇa. You will be benefited, and the persons to whom you'll talk, they will be benefited, the world will be benefited. So you have got a very great responsibility. Don't turn into the talks of the //gṛhamedhī// and break it. That is my request.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes. Chant. [devotees offer obeisances] So you will start just at half past seven? So we have got little time. Better perform... That's all. [//kīrtana//] [break] Car is ready? Car? We'll go to the car or you have got...

**Gargamuni:**
Yes, there will be a truck?

**Prabhupāda:**
Truck? Where is that truck?

**Brahmānanda:**
It will be out front.

**Prabhupāda:**
So they'll go there? No.

**Gargamuni:**
We have to take our bags.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So I want to see you in the car. [break] [Prabhupāda and devotees recite together SB //2.1.1–6] Again this verse.//

> etāvān sāṅkhya-yogābhyāṁ
> sva-dharma-pariniṣṭhayā
> janma-lābhaḥ paraḥ puṁsām
> ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ
> [[books:sb:2:1:6|[SB 2.1.6]]]

Again this verse [repeats again with devotees]. So we discussed which verse? //Śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. This verse we discussed yesterday, that "Those who are materialistic persons, they have got hundreds and thousands of topics," and, although we are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because we are in the material world, sometimes we have to deal with many unnecessary talks. But mind that our unnecessary talks and others' unnecessary talks are not the same, because we sometimes talk unnecessarily, but the aim is Kṛṣṇa. Just like Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. The //Bhagavad-gītā// begins,

> dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre
> samavetā yuyutsavaḥ
> māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva
> kim akurvata sañjaya
> [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]

The topics began from the warfield, //dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre.// But it is //dharma-kṣetra.// "Why //dharma-kṣetra?// It is battlefield." Because Kṛṣṇa is there. Kṛṣṇa is conducting the battle, therefore it is //dharma-kṣetra. Dharma-kṣetra// means religious... [end]
