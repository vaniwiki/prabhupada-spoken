**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes?

**Karandhara:**
It's going to take a few minutes to get set up so should we just go ahead? It'll take a few minutes for the photographer to get set up, get ready.

**Prabhupāda:**
He can take as we are going on. What is this? Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma... [pause] So when it is printed? I never saw it.

**Dayānanda:**
From[?] New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Nice. Where is that slip yesterday you gave me? That //mantra, nṛsiṁha-mantra?// There was one extra //mantra.// You have got everyone, slip? This. [devotees repeat each word] //Namas te, narasiṁhāya, prahlāda, āhlāda, dāyine, hiraṇyakaśipor, vakṣaḥ, śilā-ṭaṅka, nakhālaye.//

> namas te narasiṁhāya
> prahlādāhlāda-dāyine
> hiraṇyakaśipor vakṣaḥ-
> śilā-ṭaṅka-nakhālaye

> ito nṛsiṁhaḥ parato nṛsiṁho
> yato yato yāmi tato nṛsiṁhaḥ
> bahir nṛsiṁho hṛdaye nṛsiṁho
> nṛsiṁham ādiṁ śaraṇaṁ prapadye

> [sings]

> tava kara-kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-śṛṅgaṁ
> dalita-hiraṇyakaśipu-tanu-bhṛṅgam
> keśava dhṛta-narahari-rūpa jaya jagadīśa hare
> jaya jagadīśa hare, jaya jagadīśa hare

Again repeat the first //mantra.// [devotees repeat the first //mantras// and Śrīla Prabhupāda sings the second with them] The first one again repeat. [repeats] The meaning of this //mantra,// that I offer my humble obeisances to Lord Nṛsiṁha, who is the source of bliss to Prahlāda, but //hiraṇyakaśipor vakṣaḥ.// But his father Hiraṇyakaśipu, on his chest the nails of His finger is just like chisel cutting the stone. The same Personality of Godhead is //prahlāda āhlāda-dāyine. Āhlāda// means pleasure. For Prahlāda... //Prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇāhlāda, prahlāda.// A devotee is, being always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, naturally he is in blissfulness. Still more, when he meets or associates with his Lord, still more blissfulness. That is the position of the theist devotee. Whereas the atheist nondevotee, he's always feeling like a strike of the chisel, like what do you call? Stone cutting chisel. //Nakha. Nakhālaye.// Simply by the nails of His finger. All right. Where is that book? Now this //Bhāgavatam.// Yes. //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [with devotees-begins with chanting of verses S.B. 2.1.1 through 2.1.10] Then text number 11. [chanting responsively]

> etan nirvidyamānānām
> icchatām akuto-bhayam
> yogināṁ nṛpa nirṇītaṁ
> harer nāmānukīrtanam
> [[books:sb:2:1:11|[SB 2.1.11]]]

Again. [chants verse with devotees] Again. [everyone repeats] //Etan nirvidyamānānām.// There are three classes of men. One class of men, //karmīs,// they are trying to enjoy the material resources. //Icchatām,// always desire. "I want this, I want this, I want this." And another class, they are con... or rather, what is called? Frustrated. After trying utmost, "I want this, I want this, I want this," when at the end do not get anything, he is frustrated. That is called //nirvidyā.// "I don't want." Or actually one is satiated or disgusted. "No more material world. I don't want it." They are called //nirvidyamānānām.// So the one class is trying to possess and another class is trying to renounce. "I don't want." And another class is //akuto-bhayam. Akuto-bhayam.// Who is //akuto-bhayam? Akuto-bhayam// means one who does not fear. And who does not fear? Because fearfulness is one of the items of our conditional life. //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna.// Eating, sleeping, fearing, and mating. So who is without any fear? That means he's also liberated. He's not in the material platform, transcendental. Who is out of the limits of fearfulness.

So //akuto-bhayam// means the devotees. The devotees, just like Prahlāda Mahārāja, his father teased him in so many ways but he was not at all fearful. He was simply thinking of Nṛsiṁha-deva and he was fearless. So only the devotee who has fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he can be fearless. //Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati// [[books:sb:6:17:28|[SB 6.17.28]]]. //Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ// means devotees who have dedicated their life to the service of Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa. //Na kutaścana bibhyati.// He does not fear in any condition of life. So here, //icchatām akutaḥ. Icchatām// means those who are desiring. //Nirvidyamānānām// means those who are not desiring, renouncing. And the other class, //akuto-bhayam,// fearless. And //yoginām.// Another class-mystic yogis. So generally, these four classes men are there. So Śukadeva Gosvāmī says that for all of them, either he is //karmī// or he is //jñānī// or he is yogi or he is //bhakta. Karmī// means fruitive worker, and //jñānīs// means empiric philosophers, and yogis, mystic, I mean to say, yogis, and //bhaktas,// and the devotees. Generally, these four classes of men.

So Śukadeva Gosvāmī gives his judgement. //Nṛpa,// "My dear king, for all these classes of men," //nirṇītam,// "it is already decided." This is Vedic conclusion. You haven't got to search out. You have to take information from the authority. So here Śukadeva Gosvāmī is authority, that "For all these classes of men this is decided conclusively." What is that? //Harer nāmānukīrtanam.// Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Either you are //jñānī,// either you are yogi, either you are //karmī,// you desiring something or not desiring something, but you have got your objective, perfection of life. So if you want that, then chant Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. Thank you very much.

**Karandhara:**
We're going to pose. We're just about ready. Everyone can pose?

**Prabhupāda:**
This is all right. Oh yes, special pose.

**Karandhara:**
If everyone stands up and dances then we won't be able to... You can sit for just a minute longer.

**Prabhupāda:**
So chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Sit down for a moment. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa... Chant. Chant. [//kīrtana//] [end]
