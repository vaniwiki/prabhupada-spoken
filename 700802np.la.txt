Nṛsiṁha-deva may save you. Lord Nṛsiṁha, //prahlāda āhlāda-dāyine.// And to the Hiraṇyakaśipu, //śilā-ṭaṅka-nakhālaye.// Both ways Kṛṣṇa is protecting. And Viṣṇu, you see He has got four hands. In two hands He's carrying //śaṇkha, cakra// and in two hands //gadā, padma.// This //śaṅkha// and //padma// is for the devotees, and //gadā// and //cakra// for the demons. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, yadā yadā hi... paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. He has got two business. To give protection to the devotee and to kill the demons. But the result is one. He does good to the demons by killing him and He does good to the devotees by giving him protection.

Nṛsiṁha-deva will give you protection in my absence. I am now going to Japan to get some books printed personally and after that my program is to go to India. Maybe I shall be able to establish some temples there. Of course in India there are many temples, but it does not mean that I shall not also establish some temples. Just like there is overpopulation. It does not mean that one should not beget child. Similarly, there may be many hundreds of thousand temples in India, still our this society, ISKCON, should have their own temples. That is the way since time immemorial. There are hundreds and thousands of temples. So my advice to you, I am old man. So even I may not return, you shall continue this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. This is eternal and I shall request you to keep the standard as I have already given you the program. The Deity worship, the //kīrtana,// the street //saṅkīrtana,// distribution of literature, books. You should carry on this program with great enthusiasm. That is my request.

In the path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness the first principle is enthusiasm. If you lack enthusiasm then other things will not happen. And you can keep enthusiastic if you follow the rules and regulation and chant regularly Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Otherwise that enthusiasm also will dry. So six things are required for advancing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The first thing is enthusiasm. //Utsāhān dhairyāt.// And patient. And //niścayād,// with conviction, firm conviction. //Utsāhān dhairyāt niścayād tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.// Following the rules and regulation, chalked out plans. And //sato vṛtteḥ,// dealing very straightforward. No diplomacy, no politics, no duplicity. That will not help. //Sato vṛtteḥ. Vṛtteḥ,// his profession should be very straightforward. No underhand dealings. //Sato vṛtteḥ// and //sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]], and in the association of devotees. Six things. Enthusiasm, patience, firm conviction, following the rules and regulations, dealing straightforward, no duplicity, and in association of devotees. If you can keep these six principles always in front then your progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is sure. There is no doubt about it. So as far as possible I've tried to train you and you are doing nice. I'm satisfied. So keep the standard and go on. March forward and Kṛṣṇa will bless you. Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant.
