**Prabhupāda:**
You have heard about our philosophy? You have heard about our philosophy?

**Guest [1] [Indian man]:**
Whatever I have read, but, you see, I don't believe what I have read. I believe only whatever I have talked to you, whatever you have said.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that is another thing. But still, what is your conception of our philosophy? What is that teaching?

**Guest (1):**
Whose? My?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, as we are?

**Guest (1):**
No, I have understood what I have heard from you, what is your conception of God, I have not understood.

**Prabhupāda:**
Our conception of God is that He is a transcendental person. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Īśvara// means Lord. The Supreme Lord is a person. As you are person, He is also person, but He is the chief person. //Nityo nityānāṁ.// He is the leader, and we are all led. Or He is the master; we are the servitors. That is our self-realization, to understand that "I am eternal servant of God." In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātanaḥ:// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]] "Eternally all the living entities are My part and parcels." So as the part and parcel of anything is to serve the cause of the whole, similarly, all living entities, their only business is to serve the Supreme. That is all.

**Guest (1):**
Swamiji, I have understood that the...[indistinct]... if //Gītā// is written afterwards by Sanjaya, then...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then what?

**Guest (1):**
Then just to prove... [indistinct] According to me, when Lord Kṛṣṇa... [indistinct] When the //ātmā// goes into the trance, the mind goes into the trance, and into the //śuddha-sattva,// then he gets the vision of all, past, future, and present.

**Prabhupāda:**
First thing that you said, that //Bhagavad-gītā// was given in seven verses, and later on, Vyāsadeva has expanded. Now, suppose accepting that Vyāsadeva has expanded, do you find any difference between Vyāsadeva's explanation and the original seven verses?

**Guest (1):**
No. Of course, that is... [unintelligible]

**Prabhupāda:**
Then, accepting even that Vyāsadeva has expanded, so there is no difference. Therefore, even if we take the //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is presented by Vyāsadeva, so there is nothing to be said against it.

**Guest (1):**
Nothing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he gave us only eight verses, //Śikṣāṣṭaka.// But our Gosvāmīs, they have written volumes of books on that eight verses. But there is no difference of the writings of the Gosvāmīs and the original eight verses. That is not very important thing.

**Guest (1):**
One more, sir. Lord Kṛṣṇa has never asked Arjuna to sit and do //bhajana.// He said, //uttiṣṭha mām anusmara yuddhya:// [[books:bg:8:7|[Bg. 8.7]]] "Get up and fight! And fight! And fight! That fight, that is your right." I'll fight. That is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So fight with whom?

**Guest (1):**
"Fight with your enemy."

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is your enemy?

**Guest (1):**
Even physical, bodily, whatever it is, whatever it is, but you must know who your enemies are. Your enemy may be my friend. [part indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice proposal. Unless you find an enemy, how you can fight? So of course, we do not say... We Vaiṣṇavas do not say that there is no need of fighting. We never say. When there is need of fighting we must fight. Rather, somebody in New York, some Goldsmith, he was that, "Why Kṛṣṇa is advising Arjuna to fight, to become violent?" So somebody protests like that. But there is no meaning of protesting against the action of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is our view. So we Vaiṣṇavas, we are chanting. It does not mean that when there is need of fighting with //avaiṣṇava// we shall lack in strength. We can fight. One gentleman inquired from me that "Vaiṣṇavism makes one dull. He cannot act." And, "No. You have not seen a Vaiṣṇava." In the two fightings, great fighting, the //Rāmāyaṇa// and //Mahābhārata,// the hero was Hanuman and Arjuna, and they fought.

**Guest (1):**
They fought.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And who can be better Vaiṣṇava than them?

**Guest (1):**
Nobody.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Vaiṣṇava does not mean he is dull. No.

**Guest (1):**
No, that is well proved. If there is need...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So our present fighting is atheism, against atheism. They say, "There is no God. God is dead. I am God. You are God." We are fighting against these principles. So our fighting is very strong. You don't think that we are keeping idly. I have come here to fight with these atheists, you see, and we go everywhere. We are fighting with atheists all over the world. So we are meeting so many opposing elements. You see? They say, "God is dead." In America, when I first went, they were popularizing theory that "God is dead." But they again accepted and: God is not dead, but He is here with Swamiji." They accepted. So these atheistic theories, that "Everyone is God," "I am God," "you are God," "God is dead," "there is no God," "God is not person"---we are fighting against these principles. We say, "God is Kṛṣṇa. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kṛṣṇa. He is a person, and He is not dead." This is our preaching. Therefore it is a fight.

**Guest (1):**
He is not dead. He is not dead.

**Prabhupāda:**
How He can be dead? How you can think of like that, that God is dead? That is foolishness.

**Guest (1):**
If you say God is dead, that means you are... that is your own ignorance.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we are fighting against this ignorance, so many ignorance. And at the present moment so many theories and religious principles have sprung up unnecessarily. You see? But we are sticking to the principle that the only religion is to surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is real religion: surrender.

**Guest (1):**
Complete surrender.

**Prabhupāda:**
Complete surrender. That is real religion. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityjya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja. Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. These are Kṛṣṇa's words. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. //Prapadyate//---that is surrender. //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. These words are there.

**Guest (1):**
I like only the last //ślokas...// [indistinct]... where Lord Kṛṣṇa analyzes and... [indistinct] ...but to bring your mind and //ātmā// together that process is called yoga.

**Prabhupāda:**
But you know that Kṛṣṇa said, //yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā:// [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]] "Of all the yogis, one who is always thinking of Me within his mind, he is first-class." Do you accept this?

**Guest (1):**
Of all the //yoginām?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ:// "Of all the yogis..." //Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ.// That is the last verse of the yoga chapter, //sāṅkhya-yoga// chapter. //Yoginām...// When Arjuna said that "This practice of //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// is not possible for me."

**Guest (1):**
No, of course not.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he said. When he said like that, so Kṛṣṇa answered, "Yes, practice. If you practice, it can be possible. But still, anyone..." He summarized the whole yoga process, //yoginām api sarveṣāṁ:// "Of all yogis, anyone who is thinking of Me always, he is the first-class yogi."

**Guest (1):**
That is //karma-yoga.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you say //karma-yoga?// Where you get this?

**Guest (1):**
"Whatever you do." "Whatever you do." It is not written that you should do the //aṣṭāṅga-yoga.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no. We are discussing this verse. He said that "Anyone who is always think..." //Karma-yogi// also always thinks of Kṛṣṇa. That's all right. That is not denied. But the highest principle is always keeping Kṛṣṇa within his mind. //Premāñjana-cchurita...// That is confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā. Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. This kind of practice of yoga can be done by an unalloyed devotee. //Premāñjana-cchurita,// by developing the dormant love of God. That is... That is the highest perfection. And another thing is, you are accepting mind as //ātmā,// are you not? That's not correct. Mind is not //ātmā.//

**Guest (1):**
No, no, mind is not //ātmā.// No. The //ātmā// and mind, they come together, each other come. When your mind does not go from here to there...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, mind fixed up in //ātmā.// That's nice. But mind is not //ātmā.//

**Guest (1):**
No, no.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mind is matter, subtle matter.

**Guest (1):**
Certainly. That is the laws.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mind is kind of fume of the //ātmā.// So mind becomes, changes the color of the fume according to the state of the //ātmā.// If the //ātmā// is in pure state, then mind is pure. If the //ātmā// is impure state, the mind is impure. So we have taught all our disciples, //satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]], always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]].

**Guest (1):**
//Satataṁ kīrtayanto yo māṁ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. //Dṛḍha-vratāḥ:// "One who is always chanting about Me and endeavoring with great determination to reach Me, he is //mahātmā.//"

**Guest (1):**
As you have said, //nāhaṁ tiṣṭhāmi vaikuṇṭhe yogināṁ hṛdayeṣu vā mad-bhakteṣ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tiṣṭhāmi.// That's it. Therefore a devotee's position is sublime. Kṛṣṇa comes as a devotee also. Actually this happened. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he happened to be a Mohammedan, Lord Caitanya's devotee. So in those days, five hundred years ago, there was some Hindu-Muslim... Still that is going on. So he did not enter Jagannātha temple to create some disturbance. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also did not ask him that "You go to Jagannātha temple. Who can check you?" Of course, if Caitanya Mahāprabhu had ordered, he would have gone. Neither he wanted to go, neither Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that "You must go." Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to come to him. //Tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyanti mad-bhaktāḥ.// This is the practical. He came to the devotee where he was chanting. So instead of approaching God, if you chant, God will approach you. That is a fact, we see. Instead of Haridāsa Ṭhākura going to Jagannātha, Jagannātha Himself was coming to him. Every day Lord Caitanya would come and ask and sit down, "How you are feeling? What you are doing?" Then He would go to take bath in //Samudra.// Daily. It was Caitanya Mahāprabhu's... And when Haridāsa Ṭhākura expired, He personally took the body and cremated on the bank of the //Samudra// and he performed the funeral ceremony. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was so... And he was given the title //nāmācārya,// "authority of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//" Very nice that you are cultivating this knowledge. It is very nice. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. This cultivation of spiritual knowledge means perfection of life. But people do not try for it. Therefore //Gītā// says, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu:// "Out of many thousands of men, one may try to cultivate knowledge for spiritual advancement." And //yatatām api siddhānāṁ:// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]] "Out of many such persons who are cultivating spiritual knowledge, hardly one can understand what is Kṛṣṇa."

**Guest (1):**
Very correct. To understand Him is a lot.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is liberation. //Janma karma me divyam yo janati tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. To understand Kṛṣṇa... Nobody can understand Kṛṣṇa, but still, to such an extent, if one can understand Him, then he immediately becomes liberated. Immediately. And not to speak of developing his love of Kṛṣṇa, simply by knowledge, by real knowledge, if one understands Kṛṣṇa, that is sufficient to make him liberated. And those who are devotees, for them liberation is very insignificant. //Muktir mukulitāñjaliḥ sevate 'sman.//

**Guest (1):**
On the first day of this inauguration, and there were definitions about //karma-yoga.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, the governor. [laughter] Just see. He is speaking of //karma-yoga.// Slaughtering ten thousand cows, that is //karma-yoga.// This nonsense speaking of //karma-yoga.//

**Guest (1):**
So actually I shall present...

**Prabhupāda:**
The governor became little perturbed. He wanted to go immediately. You were present? And when the other men began to speak all hodgepodge...

**Guest (1):**
I like your one sentence that day. Whatever is according to the //śāstras,// that is correct. I agree to it. Nobody says that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is a fact.

**Guest (1):**
That's a fact.

**Prabhupāda:**
Karma done does not mean that you manufacture something and it becomes a //karma.//

**Guest (1):**
It is written, whatever, in //śāstras.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guest (1):**
That is //karma-yoga.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I was just going to explain all this //karma, vikarma, akarma.//

**Guest (1):**
What does he know? [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
In India, the land of sages, land of Kṛṣṇa, land of Lord Rāmacandra, land of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, without any restriction cow slaughter is going on. And they are speaking of //karma-yoga.// Just see the fun.

**Guest (1):**
I don't know where this India is going to, the land of Kṛṣṇa is going to.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well... No, we should try our best.

**Guest (1):**
We have to fight these habits. It is our duty.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's it. So you are a military man. I request you to fight against this nonsense.

**Guest (1):**
Swami, I wish you could come sometime. I will gather section of some people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I'll go. I'll go. Where? Just fix up some time.

**Guest (1):**
Because I am very near to temple, only 100 yards.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. That Takat? [?] Takat?

**Guest (1):**
No, not Takat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, I see, oh. We are thinking of having a branch near that Takat, in that Takat colony. What is your idea? Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness center. Is that a good locality?

**Guest (1):**
I'll tell you. I'll fight Tukori[?]. [indistinct]...

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. No, no. Think twice before doing.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Tuesday morning, December 15th?

**Guest (1):**
Tuesday morning? Morning, I have to go to a village somewhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
You give them after seven.

**Guest (1):**
Ah, no, whenever opportunity.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, then make...

**Haṁsadūta:**
Evenings are all engaged.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, evenings are... But evenings up to which date? Tuesday?

**Guest (1):**
Up to the sixteenth.

**Prabhupāda:**
Up to the sixteenth? Then probably on the seventeenth we may go. Not fixed up, but there is chance. That is chance because we are thinking of an appointment with the prime minister in Delhi by the eighteenth, so if that is fixed up, then we have to start.

**Guest (1):**
[discusses date for engagement with Haṁsadūta]

**Prabhupāda:**
Is there any engagement, for...?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
When?

**Haṁsadūta:**
[discusses date for engagement with 1]

**Yamunā:**
Fifteenth is the appearance day of His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fifteenth is the appearance date? ? Oh, then we have to perform.

**Haṁsadūta:**
What are we supposed to do? Fast?

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall fast up till twelve and then offer //puṣpāñjali// and then chant, as far as we can supply.

**Guest (1):**
So Tuesday afternoon from three to four.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You write his name.

**Haṁsadūta:**
May I have your name?

**Guest (1):**
Major Ghun N. Susuy[?]

**Prabhupāda:**
You are Maharastrian.

**Guest (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Maharastrians, they are fighting nation.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Telephone?

**Prabhupāda:**
Telephone? Telephone?

**Guest (1):**
Telephone, no, I haven't got.

**Prabhupāda:**
Maharastrian spirit and Bengali spirit, almost...

**Guest (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guest (1):**
[Hindi?] [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. These boys also, from their childhood they are addicted to so many things. Gave up immediately.

**Guest (1):**
That's nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Immediately on my word they gave up. Meat-eaters, they have been described by Canakya Pandit.

**Guest (1):**
Though we are //kṣatriyas,// but nobody takes meat in our house.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kṣatriyas// are allowed to take meat by hunting, not by slaughterhouse. Not all, but some of them.

**Guest (1):**
When you can't get anything to eat, then only you can do that. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] ...not in my //sannyāsa// stage. Long ago accepted //sannyāsa.// Sometimes in 1945.

**Guest (1):**
Are you going there now this month?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I can go everywhere if the arrangement... //Aiye.//

**Guest (1):**
[Hindi discussion with other Indians]

**Yamunā:**
Janaka Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Canakya, Canakya Pandit. He was a great politician and //brāhmaṇa.//

**Yamunā:**
Was he in Lord Caitanya's time?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. He was five thousand years..., not. Three thousand years.

**Haṁsadūta:**
He was a great devotee?

**Devotee:**
No.

**Haṁsadūta:**
No?

**Guest (1):**
He was politician. He was a mathematician.

**Prabhupāda:**
He was very learned scholar, //brāhmaṇa,// rigid //brāhmaṇa.// That's all.

**Guest (1):**
He was insulted once in boyhood by something of Mahātmānanda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nanda.

**Guest (1):**
Then he took oath that "All right, today I turn my [indistinct] and one day I will dethrone you from here. Then you can call me [indistinct]," and he went away. [tells story]

**Haṁsadūta:**
Great determination.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yamunā:**
He was a great devotee?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Yamunā:**
So he's not authority.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, he was not authority in the spiritual sense. He was a politician, moralist, politician. That's all. Worldly man.

**Haṁsadūta:**
How many people will be there?

**Guest (1):**
Swamiji, you were telling something?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I don't find... [break] //...vanaṁ sattvaṁ na durjante, sattva vasanti, tad eva ca durjanas tu pade pade.// This is another verse.

**Guest (1):**
[Sanskrit]

**Prabhupāda:**
So we made some life member. Is there any possibility of getting, enrolling some life member? That...?

**Guest (1):**
Life member means...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Institution. We want some life members. Otherwise how we can conduct this institution? [indistinct] Through telegram? Or reply?

**Haṁsadūta:**
I think it was returned.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who sent?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Gita Bhavan Sect.[?], Gita Bhavan Marg, Indore. "Please reply definite arrival time, Surat. Very anxious. Janwal, care of [indistinct]." That's how he replied.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there we are already engaged. Cannot go Surat immediately. Let us follow that.

**Haṁsadūta:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is his version. Version. There is no cost. Simply [indistinct].

**Haṁsadūta:**
So what is the program there?

**Prabhupāda:**
Never mind. "Due to heavy engagement, cannot go Surat immediately. Letter follows."

**Devotee (2):**
Motorcycle...[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Are you sure, that motorcycle? Can? To go and come back here for attending meeting here? By train? How far it is?

**Haṁsadūta:**
About fifteen minutes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's all right. That's all.

**Haṁsadūta:**
No, no, we won't take any //prasādam// today.[?] We are fasting till noon because it is the appearance day of our Guru Mahārāja's spiritual master.

**Yamunā:**
Disappearance.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Disappearance? Oh. We won't be taking anything at all. Nothing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Up to twelve we don't take. Fast.

**Guest (1):**
[indistinct] ...in my house?

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever arrangement you do, that's all right. But if some of you members become our life members, that will be...

**Haṁsadūta:**
Have you seen our books? Would you like to see?

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can explain. [break] ...the footprints of liberated predecessors like Manu and others. So they are conditioned. Therefore their rules and regulations are not perfect. It cannot be perfect.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Here is our monthly magazine, //Back to Godhead.// These are our... [indistinct] This is in Washington, D.C. This is in Berkeley, California. That magazine is being printed in six languages: Hindi, English, French, German, and Japanese, and Bengali. Bengali is not yet out, but it's coming. Then Prabhupāda started presenting these books while he was still in India. This book was published in 1965. This was printed in India, the First Canto of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The First Canto comprises three volumes like this, the First Canto. And then the following Cantos are being printed by our own press in America in Boston, like this, chapter by chapter, so that people can take advantage of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and read it at their convenience instead of...

**Guest (1):**
[indistinct]

**Haṁsadūta:**
And here, Kṛṣṇa Book, is the Tenth Canto of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Prabhupāda calls it, "//Kṛṣṇa: The Supreme Personality of Godhead.//" And it's full of illustrations which are done by his American students. Just see how beautiful. There are eighty-four full color illustrations that show the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa. So the people in the western world and for the first time in the history of the world will get an idea of who God is, what He looks like, what He does, where He's residing. This is the Kṛṣṇa Book, in two volumes. This is volume number one and this is volume number two. This is just a blueprint. We haven't got a printed copy yet. Then //Teachings of Lord Caitanya, Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// which you must be familiar with, in the //Teachings of Lord Caitanya// and there are also illustrations although they're not color. They're black and white.

**Guest (1):**
Śrī Tukārāma is disciple of Caitanya.

**Prabhupāda:**
He also went through in Maharastra by His chanting, [indistinct]

**Haṁsadūta:**
And most important, Prabhupāda has presented //Bhagavad-gītā.// He calls it "//Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.//" He explains in the introduction that till now there's been so many //Bhagavad-gītās// printed in all languages and all of them are misrepresenting. They have not presented //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. They are trying to present //Bhagavad-gītā// without Kṛṣṇa. They want to leave out the speaker of //Bhagavad-gītā// and put themselves forward. So Prabhupāda has presented //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// and therefore this movement has taken such hold because the real thing is being presented. This is in San Francisco, California. Then, the //Nectar of Devotion,// Rūpa Gosvāmī's book //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// also there. This book is the lawbook of devotional service. //Īśopaniṣad,// word for word translation, then the complete English translation and purport by His Divine Grace. So these books are [indistinct] //bhakti-yoga// [indistinct] Kṛṣṇa consciousness [indistinct] explaining the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// So we have so much literature. And in India we've introduced a program, our membership program, so that we can go on distributing these literatures. And that membership program, there are four types of membership. One is life membership. Life membership means the member is entitled to all the books that we have printed plus all the books we will print in the future, plus a lifetime subscription to our magazine, //Back to Godhead.// And the member is entitled to stay at any one of our branches throughout the world free and if he happens to travel abroad or in India. We will have our branches. So that life membership fee is 1,111 rupees. And then we have donor membership. The donor member is entitled to all the books that have been printed, a lifetime subscription to our magazine, but he does not get the books in the future. That is 555 rupees. And subscriber membership, lifetime subscription to our magazine, which is 222 rupees. Or there is membership, yearly subscription to our magazine. In this way we're trying to recruit members that support our movement. This movement is being supported just by literature. So in this way we can flood the whole world with Kṛṣṇa consciousness and then there'll be a change. If we want to see a change in the world, then we have to distribute knowledge of Kṛṣṇa in this way. You are welcome to become a member. And also your friends. Tell them about our membership programs.

**Guest (1):**
Swamiji, open a center here.

**Prabhupāda:**
I wish to. I wish to open a center.

**Guest (1):**
No, no, now?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not yet.

**Guest (1):**
And how many centers in India?

**Prabhupāda:**
Practically, three.

**Guest (1):**
Swami, did you come across these Brahma-kumaris? They preach something else.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is something else. Everyone knows it.

**Guest (1):**
Once they... I was in ... So they were passing through, teaching some Kṛṣṇa or something, and their //Bhagavad-gītā// was something else.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is going on. [break] There may be musical performance but here it is by the pure devotees. That is different thing. Now, here don't you see in the Gītā Bhavan? When others perform //kīrtana// nobody takes part. And they cannot continue that //kīrtana// more than five minutes. But we can continue our //kīrtana// for five hours without any...

**Haṁsadūta:**
If we stayed there for five hours everyone would chant. [indistinct conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, //mahāmantra// they can also do, but it will not be effective because they are not pure. Here is the secret. We have... Our devotees, they are //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ// [Brs. 1.1.11], they have no other business than to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. They perform //kīrtana// to take something from Kṛṣṇa. Everyone goes to some //dharma-saṁsthāna// just to take something. But our proposition is to give everything for Kṛṣṇa and that is far different.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Everyone is pleased with the devotees, everybody.

**Guest [2] [Indian man]:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That when you do, I shall tell you. Now why do you waste your time in that way? That's all right, you are not doing so you have no business.

**Guest (2):**
[indistinct] Of course, I am not doing... [indistinct, several people talking at once.]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] This is called //vṛddha.// This is called //yoni.// This is //madhyama.// This is //anāvṛtta,// and this is //kaniṣṭha.// [indistinct conversation] Stores are now closed?

**Haṁsadūta:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So he has gone to Calcutta. [break] //Utsāhan, dhairyāt.// Are you realizing the distinction between this association and others?

**Revatīnandana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That you should realize. That is realization. We are trying to create a real spiritual path, not bogus, for livelihood. India's falldown is due to that spirit, that everyone takes everything for livelihood, that's all. Not only India, everywhere. India especially because poverty-stricken. So they take religion also as livelihood. Just like this Akhila Saheb. He wanted to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// for livelihood. Do you know that?

**Devotee (3):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
How? How it was? No, you do not know. He was proposing that "I know how to cure disease by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa." So he wanted to go to foreign countries to take this profession. That means an attempt to kill our movement in purity. Of course, nobody can kill our movement, but this sort of thinking is just against the purity of our movement: utilize Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// for curing disease. Oh, it will not stay.

**Haṁsadūta:**
No. If we put it on the window it will stay. It won't stay on the wall.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Haṁsadūta:**
If he puts it on the window it will stay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Window means it will be dark.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes. I think that [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It has to be done. Not only idea, it has to be done in practical sense. Now who will take charge of this task? That is to be found out. You write to the...

**Haṁsadūta:**
GBC?

**Prabhupāda:**
GBC.

**Haṁsadūta:**
[unintelligible] So many newspapers have come out within the last three or four years. Of course, most of them are hippie groups, but they have become... People are very anxious to read something from different angle of vision.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Haṁsadūta:**
They are tired of old newspapers. So if we present a newspaper with our angle of vision, Kṛṣṇa consciousness...

**Prabhupāda:**
So immediately you write to the GBC members.

**Haṁsadūta:**
But the articles that will be in the newspaper, they will be exactly like other newspapers? Who will write them?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, articles... Daily newspaper means there must be news. News you can purchase from the news collecting company. They will supply it. At very cheap price they'll supply. And you take advertisement. Yes. You'll cover your expenses by getting advertisements and make sufficient profit. Newspaper starting is not a losing business provided you can organize. Just like ordinary newspaper, they give... In daily news... People want to learn daily news, and they supply huge quantity. And those who are advertiser, they are simply concerned how many copies are issued. If you issue 100,000's of copies, then you can charge for each page thousand dollars. They will pay. Two thousand dollars they will pay.

**Haṁsadūta:**
That means in each city we would we have to have our own local press.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not necessarily. You can arrange with any newspaper place. You simply supply your matter; they will print. Just like we are getting from Japan, similarly, make your own layout and supply them. Immediately, within two hours, everything is complete.

**Haṁsadūta:**
But a daily newspaper has to turn out daily, so it takes time to transport it from one city to another city.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, from every city we can publish. Every city there is a newspaper place.

**Devotee (4):**
...national, just like the national...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So we have to organize. First of all let us publish in one city, big city like New York, like London, yes, Bombay, Tokyo. Big cities, world's big cities. In India only two cities are big: Calcutta, and Bombay, important. If you publish simultaneously, Calcutta... Delhi is given importance due to capital; otherwise not important as big city, as Bombay and Calcutta. Delhi, without government offices it is a dead city. Just like Washington. What is the value of Washington? It is nothing. Simply because it is headquarters of the President, it has got importance. Similarly, Delhi is that. Otherwise it is not important. But Calcutta, Bombay, is really important city in India, big business, port, all rich men, every kind of, all cultural, everything---Calcutta, and Bombay. Originally only Calcutta, now Bombay also. Because the Britishers, they made Calcutta capital. And Calcutta was very, very important city. But these Calcutta men, they create sometimes situation, very complicated. So once in 1905 the same situation was there, politically. Sir Surendranath Bannerjee made, Surendranath Bannerjee's movement, partition of Bengal. Lord Collier, he wanted to divide Bengal, made it East Bengal and West Bengal. And Surendranath Bannerjee... He is the practically father of Indian politics. Gandhi's not. He was. He was. And in the beginning, in European circles he was famous. He was called "Surrender-not." The spelling of the name, s-u-r-e-n-d-e-r, Surendranath. In Parliament he was known as "Surrender-not." He was a very powerful politician. So there was trouble in Calcutta; so therefore they transferred, 1911, capital to Delhi. Otherwise, from the very beginning of British occupation Calcutta was the capital. You have seen the government viceroy's house near that Hamilton building where you were trying to purchase.

**Haṁsadūta:**
The government house?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh yes. It is better than Buckingham Palace, such a big house.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Oh, the governor's house. The governor's house?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, governor's house.

**Haṁsadūta:**
It's surrounded just like a...

**Prabhupāda:**
A big garden. Yes. That was viceroy's house. Now it is dilapidated. Otherwise, formerly it was very, very nice. Huge palace in India. Lord Collier's policy was to bring one of the princes from England and make him king of India.

**Haṁsadūta:**
King of India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That was his policy. He favored that policy, that Indian people are in favor of monarchy. So introduce this system: one of the royal family's son should come and become king of India. That was good suggestion. If Britishers would have ruled India for the interest of India, making one king from the royal family, it would have been great success. That policy of Lord Collier was very nice.

**Haṁsadūta:**
That never happened.

**Prabhupāda:**
The same thing. The parliamentary members... Just like nowadays, party. India is suffering in party politics. And they did not like to give importance to monarchy. They wanted to rule according to their whims, and therefore the whole scheme failed. The so-called democracy under party politics is nonsense. Monarchy... I have said. That day I was in remarking that "This democracy is the government of the asses," because the population are asses and they vote another ass to be head of the government. So what you can do? //Sayuddhe kriyate rājan sa kim asnu pahanam.// These are instructions in Sanskrit. "If you make a dog a king, don't you think that he will still lap the shoes?" You cannot change his habits. //Sva... Yasya bhāvasya na sa sudurate kramaḥ.// Anyone's habits, even if you give good position, you cannot change it. The example is just like if you make a dog the king, he will immediately come from the throne and bite the shoes. You see? So materially you cannot change. Only by spiritual understanding one can be...

**Haṁsadūta:**
Canakya Pandit... I have see that book, and he says in his book that if a crow sits on a high [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. If you make a crow... The crow generally sits on the roof of the house, but that does not mean he has become a great man. "How great I am, a very beautiful bird."

**Revatīnandana:**
The symbol of the Democrat party in America is the ass.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere. As soon as you...

**Revatīnandana:**
Their symbol is an ass. They have a symbol.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Because they are asses.

**Revatīnandana:**
The Republican party is elephant and the Democratic party is ass, a donkey.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the value of vote by asses? According to Vedic civilization, there was democracy but that democracy is selected committee. Just like in England there was Privy Council. So selected body of learned //brāhmaṇas// and sages, they were guiding the king, and the king himself was properly educated how to rule over, under religious principles. He was trained from the beginning of his life as prince. As the future heir of the throne, he was trained, and at the same time, he was guided by a council of learned sages and //brāhmaṇas.// They were looking over the activities of the king. As soon as there was some mistake they will see. And there are instances; whenever there was a bad king they were dethroned. Not for political purpose. He was dethroned but his son was on the... Just like Lord Rāmacandra did. Rāmacandra killed Rāvaṇa but He never occupied the kingdom. His brother Vibhīṣaṇa proved to be faithful. He was enthroned. From the same family. And that was the system. Even a king was wrong, he would be dethroned but from his family, either his son or brother, or somebody would occupy there. Not that "Because I have conquered you, therefore I shall sit down." No. There are many instances. And therefore India was ruling all over the world. The emperor was in India, and the kings of different states, their family was. So there was no rebellion. And in every state a king was trained in the same process, guided by committee of learned //brāhmaṇa// and sages. How perfect this monarchy is. Monarchy... That Lord Collier studied that the Indian people like monarchy. Even these states, the so-called states... Now the Congress government has killed them; otherwise the Britishers were maintaining, necessary, and they were developed. Now see. The Indore was far better before. You can see from the buildings, from the whole city. It was very prosperous city. Still it is going on. So every state, the native prince, the Britishers maintained so many native prince. And because they maintained them, they were friends to the Britishers. They knew the policy, if you create //zamindar,// landlord. They created this aristocratic class to support them. So when Gandhi and other leaders started this movement all the princes and //zamindars,// they were in favor of British. Therefore it took so much time to transfer. And as a retaliation, the common people have bereft them of their kingdom. "No more kingdom because you always supported Britishers." It is a great politics. Therfore they have taken... The //zamindars,// immediately after this attainment of independence, all the //zamindars// and kings were bereft of their possessions. You were in Calcutta? Oh, none of you were with me. We saw one house for purchasing. That was a big //zamindar's// house, Tagore Thakur[?] You saw? Yes. If you have saw... How nicely it was. When they were in opulence in our childhood, oh, it was a house to be seen. There are many houses. Just like in England the lord families. In Ascot, where we stayed, that was also lord family's house. Now Yoko's house, a third-class Japanese girl. She has become the queen of the house. And how third-class, low-grade. It is the sitting room and a naked picture has... How much degraded people have become. How this man is daring to hang that picture in his sitting room so that everyone who comes sees. How much low-graded they are. They want change, but because they have no [indistinct] education they are going to the animal sphere. That is hippie movement. Yes. From animal standard they become civilized. The same story, //punar muṣika bhāvaḥ.// You know that story? "Again become mouse."

**Haṁsadūta:**
Oh yeah, I've heard that.

**Prabhupāda:**
The story is a mouse came to a saintly person: "Sir, I am in trouble. If you kindly release me?" "What is that trouble?" "A cat, they are after me. I am always at risk of life." "So what do you want?" "You also make me a cat." "All right. You become a cat." Then again he came. "Sir, again the complaint is here." "What is that?" "Dogs are chasing me." "Then what do you want?" "I want to become a dog." "All right. You become a dog." In this way he came up to the tiger by the benediction of the... And when he became a tiger, he was... [snarling sound-laughter] Just like our Brahmānanda Prabhu. "All right. Again become mouse." You see? So these civilization is like that. They became tiger, and they are so much badly trained up that they have to become again a mouse. That is the way. That is the way of nature. If you don't improve yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you again become stool worms. The human form of life is an opportunity to come out of the cycle of birth and death, but if one does not take---these are the statements in //Padma Purāṇa//---then he loses the chance. They do not know what is life, how life is rotating, talking nonsense, "I am God. Why Kṛṣṇa should be God? This is written by man." How much low-graded people have become. They are completely under the laws of nature. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]], stringent laws of nature, and still, they are claiming, "I am God. I am this. I am that. I am free. I am..." And they do not mind, even they are degraded to the position of the worm of stool. But there is possibility. What is this worm of stool? It is also living entity. It is not a different thing. //Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. One who knows, he knows that the worm of stool and Brahmā are the same living entity. Simply under different reaction of //karma// one has become Brahmā and another has become the stool worm. Now we begin. [break] It is not difficult. Simply the layout should be sent to different parts, and they will make immediately plate, and that will be paper. Daily you have to send it. Eh?

**Haṁsadūta:**
The best place to start is Boston.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, already. Even in small scale we can start from Boston.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Just like one or two pages.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Never mind. Just like I began in that way. You have seen the...

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes, I saw the original //Back to Godhead.// A lot of your articles were commenting about current events.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The editorial board must be very intelligent how to talk about //Back to Godhead// with current politics. Giriraja, you can do that?

**Giriraja:**
I could try.

**Prabhupāda:**
Try. You just try it immediately. You take one newspaper and comment on the current news. Any one of you... Every one of you can do. And show me how you have given. Then you start immediately. We have got many things to do. We have Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is the //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. What these petty politicians and three acres of land? Their stage is three acres of land; our stage is the unlimited. That I have mentioned in the second volume of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So what news they can publish? Three acres of land. We have got the innumerable universes. We can supply so much news, provided people are ready to read it. We have published so many books, they are not even able to read these books. So the other devotees, [laughs] they cannot ri..., come at five o'clock. That is the test. Yes. One who cannot rise early in the morning, he is not spiritually serious. That is test. //Brāhma-muhūrta,// this hour, one hour before sunrise, is very auspicious moment.

**Haṁsadūta:**
I can tell everyone that wants a program to come at five o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Haṁsadūta:**
If somebody wants a program, I can say "Come and see me at five o'clock." Because after they hear you and they have //maṅgala-ārati,// then they will be more thoughtful about our...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, tell them.

**Haṁsadūta:**
I think that's a good idea.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can say now, "If anyone wants to see us, please come at five o'clock, early in the morning." Then I shall see how much serious he is. Now I have decided to go to Delhi. Even Gurudāsa suggests rightly. All of us, we should go to Delhi.

**Yamunā:**
It might be difficult to make arrangements, Guru Mahārāja. The place where Gurudāsa is presently staying is not equipped for ten people at present. We'll have to arrange.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we can arrange in the Birla's house. He has a nice //dharmaśāla.// You know Birla's house?

**Yamunā:**
Yes. We were invited to stay there for ten days.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that's all right. So, who invited?

**Devotee (3):**
One of the people connected with the temple has associated with us in Delhi and [indistinct] has invited us.

**Prabhupāda:**
So first of all take information from the Pujari[?] in which train they have booked our seats for Delhi, and you write immediately one letter to Dhruva in Bombay and Tamal Kṛṣṇa also, that Dhruva may instruct the Delhi Birla's //dharmaśāla// to accommodate us immediately. So their //dharmaśāla.// It is Birla's //dharmaśāla.// First of all we have to see how they have made our seats.

**Revatīnandana:**
So the residential place belongs to Mrs. Birla?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is a temple, very big temple.

**Haṁsadūta:**
So we should book seats for Delhi on which day?

**Prabhupāda:**
Seventeenth.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Seventeenth you want to leave?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. What is the day, seventeenth?

**Devotee (3):**
Today is the fourteenth.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, day?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Today is Monday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Seventeenth is Thursday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thursday?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Thursday, seventeenth.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Thursday, before afternoon, we shall start.

**Devotee (3):**
You want to go by plane Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I am asking one ticket for plane.

**Devotee (3):**
You'll fly alone to Delhi?

**Yamunā:**
The Delhi airport?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is not difficulty. Ask Gurudāsa to take me. For two hours I can sit down. It goes direct to Delhi from here.

**Devotee (3):**
No, it makes two stops.

**Prabhupāda:**
That doesn't matter.

**Devotee (3):**
But the same plane.

**Prabhupāda:**
Same plane. And you come, all, by train.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Will we open a bank account here? Will we open an account in Indore?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Haṁsadūta:**
This morning with Mr. Holi.

**Yamunā:**
So when we find out your arrival time, Gurudāsa, we can inform Gurudāsa when you'll be arriving?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And then the next day you come, all, by train. Thursday we can wa...? What is that Thursday?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Thursday

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, industrial house. Industrial house.

**Guest (2):**
It's called "Industry House."

**Prabhupāda:**
Industry, that's all. Industry House. Industry House Dhruva's full name, you know?

**Devotee (3):**
R.C.

**Prabhupāda:**
R.C. Dhruva, Secretary to Mr. R.D. Birla, Industry House, Church Reclamation...

**Haṁsadūta:**
Bombay, West.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bombay.

**Yamunā:**
Is Parliament in session again?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Yamunā:**
I was thinking that Parliament goes in and out of session, and I wondered if they remembered this if Parliament was in session again.

**Giriraja:**
No.

**Yamunā:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Parliament is in session now?

**Yamunā:**
No. Out of session now. When it's in session then all of the politicians come from their castles and [indistinct] their most of the members of Parliament [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
So when the Parliament begins?

**Yamunā:**
It will be [indistinct] It separates for about a month and then comes together.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Aiye. Aiye.// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa...

**Giriraja:**
Insofar as seeing the prime minister, this is the best time because he is not so preoccupied.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Where is that picture? There was picture you prepared.

**Devotee (3):**
[indistinct] picture with a letter [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So... So how long you talked with the Prime Minister?

**Yamunā:**
Maybe ten minutes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So she took some interest?

**Yamunā:**
She took a courteous interest. As I say, there was no doubt that at the time that she saw him she was pressed with other matters. A very personal friend of hers that Gurudāsa is now staying with told us that she was very impressed, her personal secretary was very impressed, and that she said---we have it on tape---that she would like to see us again and she was sorry that she didn't realize that we had been waiting for so long. Otherwise we could have come earlier, she would have [indistinct] In that way [indistinct] some time in the future.

**Devotee (4):**
In [indistinct] we saw some yogi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Pressing nose. Nose-pressing philosophy.

**Devotee (5):**
Haṭha-yoga also.

**Yamunā:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
So what was his philosophy?

**Yamunā:**
You do some exercises and know God, be self-realized.

**Prabhupāda:**
You should have said to him, "Are you self-realized?"

**Yamunā:**
I'm such a rascal, I didn't even try.

**Prabhupāda:**
If they tell you then he's God...

**Devotee (5):**
[indistinct] exercise and breathing [indistinct] some type of meditation performed.

**Yamunā:**
He's social swami, a very social swami. He's very polished in a material way.

**Devotees (5):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
And smoking also?

**Yamunā:**
I didn't inquire into his vices.

**Devotee (5):**
In New York they call them "uptown swamis."

**Yamunā:**
His example of spiritual life is based on material prosperity.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why they should go to the yoga system? The science is more advanced. Before flying in the sky by a yogi he has to press his nose for so many years and the science has given us the airplane. He can purchase ticket, immediately fly. [laughter] What is use of pressing nose?

**Yamunā:**
You explain that in //Bhāgavatam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. What is the use, wasting time?

**Revatīnandana:**
[indistinct] about when you walk on the water, walking on the water is a bogus thing [indistinct] two cent yogi because for two cents he could have taken [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. If that is the ultimate end of life, to walk on the water or to fly in the sky, so science has given them all opportunity. And the material science is so advanced, that all this yoga system is now almost accomplished because that is material only, material prosperity. //Aiye.//

**Yamunā:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, eating flesh sumptuously and get fat. Flesh-eaters get fatty very quickly, flesh-eaters. //Māṁsa.// The skin becomes increased for flesh-eating. You see in your country, the Russia? Russian beauty-big belly, fat. That...

**Yamunā:**
Germans are like that too. Germans.

**Prabhupāda:**
Germans. If you eat meat, you very quickly can get fat. Also too much ghee also. That is also. But ghee will increase your belly only. Just the //Marwaris...// [laughter] But by eating flesh you'll get sturdy, good lump of muscles. That is... In //Āyur-Veda// there is a chapter which is called //Dravya-guṇa.// There is a book, //Dravya-guṇa.// So they have analyzed so many different kinds of flesh-birds, beasts, animals. How they have analyzed? That "If you eat this kind flesh you will get this kind of result." Hundreds of fleshes. What do they know? They can eat only cow's flesh or dog's flesh or hog's flesh. Yes. But there are so many, even birds, beasts, animals, and so many, analysis. And Bernard Shaw, I think, he wrote one book, "You Are What You Eat."

**Haṁsadūta:**
George Bernard Shaw.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So they are becoming animals, animals eating animal flesh. Bernard Shaw was vegetarian.

**Devotee (6):**
Except he would take liver for his health.

**Prabhupāda:**
Liver?

**Devotee (6):**
Yes. He used to take some liver periodically for his health.

**Prabhupāda:**
Medicine. There are many liver extract preparations.

**Devotee (6):**
No, not liver extract. Maybe. I don't know exactly. But I know he used to take liver. Not cod liver oil or anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, liver extract preparations there are many medicines. For anemic patient liver extract is recommended.

**Devotee (6):**
That's all right for us to take?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, but if you are going to die, then you can take.

**Yamunā:**
Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
When required for such trouble, if you are going to die, then, to save yourself, you can.

**Devotee (6):**
If that liver can be eaten raw...

**Prabhupāda:**
If you are going to die. Not ordinary. If it is clear that without liver extract you shall die, you can take.

**Devotee (4):**
You cannot tell. You can't tell until you actually [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Because when there is question of death it is recommended you may take anything to save your life.

**Yamunā:**
Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
But those who are rigid, they are prepared to die even.

**Yamunā:**
Vaiṣṇavas, wouldn't they just chant?

**Prabhupāda:**
Their proposal is "Death is sure today or tomorrow, so why shall I change my principles? Death will take place even if I live for ten years more, and what is the benefit? Why shall I change my principles? It is not that by taking that medicine or liver extract I shall be //amara,// immortal." That is not possible. If somebody gives some medicine that one can make himself immortal, that is another thing. Nobody is going to be immortal. Why he should be afraid of death? Death will take place. "As sure as death." So today, or tomorrow, or hundred years after. So if one moment is utilized for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that makes life successful. Why shall I live for hundred years, waste my time? One moment is sufficient for living.

**Himāvatī:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? I just have one question about the ending, that Ajāmila, he was calling the name of his youngest son.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nārāyaṇa.

**Himāvatī:**
He was thinking but he was calling out to him, and after calling, he was reminded of his early life, of his worshiping the real Nārāyaṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nārāyaṇa.

**Himāvatī:**
And therefore Nārāyaṇa saved him. Isn't that true?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes.

**Himāvatī:**
Not that he was simply calling and Nārāyaṇa had to save him...

**Prabhupāda:**
But simply calling, "Nārāyaṇa," he reminded, he remembered. Remembered. Yes.

**Himāvatī:**
He remembered the real Nārāyaṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because actually when one chants Lord Kṛṣṇa's name, Lord's name, immediately he remembers Lord's form, activities, pastimes, everything. That is natural.

**Himāvatī:**
Not that he was unconsciously just chanting and the Lord saved him in that way, but he actually remembered the Lord.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the remark of Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. But according to others' opinion, even simply by chanting, that is sufficient. In the //Bhāgavata// it is stated like that. But Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has remarked that this chanting referred to the context. Immediately he remembered Nārāyaṇa.

**Himāvatī:**
In that same connection, the story of Ṭhākura Haridāsa and the harlot. She began to chant and told him the reason that she was a prostitute, she was no good and simply by that association she began to chant or by previous association...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, by association. By the influence of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. For three days, three days she associated.

**Himāvatī:**
But Professor Sanyal was putting forward his theory that in previous lives she had had association; therefore she began to chant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why previous lives? That's not very good reason.

**Himāvatī:**
Subconscious, that she had subconsciously remembered.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. No, no. That is not.

**Himāvatī:**
In one of the //Back to Godhead// magazines

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not. He advocates that.[?] Direct association with Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Why previously?

**Himāvatī:**
We want to say that previously she had done some chanting.

**Prabhupāda:**
We don't find any such thing. Professor Sanyal was not very much advanced. He committed so many blunders.

**Himāvatī:**
You heard about that article?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Himāvatī:**
That was the [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, if that sort of remark is given it is not against the //śāstra,// but it was not necessarily previously. His direct association... Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,

> sādhu saṅga sādhu saṅga sarva śāstra kaya
> lava mātra sādhu saṅge sarva siddhi haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:54|[Cc. Madhya 22.54]]]

"Even a moment's association with a pure devotee---all success." Not necessarily that one has to acquire it previous, no. Generally it is so, but //sādhu sanga// has got its effect. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //lavamatra sādhu sanga sarva siddhi haya.// You have not read in the //Sanātana-śikṣā// in the //Teachings of Lord Caitanya?//

**Revatīnandana:**
Does that also apply to reading the words of a pure devotee?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Revatīnandana:**
Even a little association with your books has the same effect?

**Prabhupāda:**
Effect, of course, it requires both the things. One must be very eager to take it. Just like Mahārāja Parīkṣit heard //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and there are so many others. They are also reading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So Mahārāja Parīkṣit was very serious. So both things should be serious. Just like the example: the husband and wife must be potent; then there is pregnancy. Otherwise there is no pregnancy. So sewing the seed, the field also must be fertile or receptive, then the seed will fructify. It is reciprocal.

**Revatīnandana:**
If the seed starts to sprout and it lacks sufficient facilities, then it will die completely.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes.

**Revatīnandana:**
But if a spiritual seed sprouts, then whatever sprout is made is never lost. Right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is not lost, but it is checked. Sometimes he is checked.

**Revatīnandana:**
Because the tendency to revive again.

**Prabhupāda:**
In that way again one has to... That brings the question of previous life. One was advanced so much; it was checked by some reason; he again begins from that point. Just like Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura. Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura was advanced in his previous life up to //bhava-bhakti.// Somehow or other, it was checked. But as soon as he heard the words from the prostitute, "Oh, you are so much after the flesh and similar, and bones and skin. If you had been so much eager for Kṛṣṇa, how you would have been disposed," immediately he came to that point and immediately left. I'll take [devotees offer obeisances]

**Devotee (6):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? The other day you talked about the spirit soul and his position in the //brahma-jyotir,// that there's no shelter there. Just like we go up, up, up into the sky [indistinct] there's no shelter there so you have to go to some planet. So I was thinking that the reason why our position is shaky is due to this body, but spirit, being restless can remain anywhere...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, but there the shelter is transcendental bliss. The impersonal Brahman is not transcendental bliss. It is simply eternity. But we want three things: eternity, full knowledge, and blissful life. So there is no bliss.

**Devotee (6):**
Yes. Just as we require shelter because we have the body...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So similarly, this living entity also requires shelter of blissful life. That is this association of Kṛṣṇa. So unless he gets that, he wants blissfulness, but---there is some spiritual blissfulness; he has no information---he comes down again to this perverted blissfulness of this material world.

**Devotee (6):**
They don't take their pleasure in being there in the //brahma-jyotir?//

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no pleasure. Blissfulness is not there, //brahma-jyotir// is simply eternity, that's all. The same example can be given. Just like sunlight. There is only light. But on a planet the effect of the light is there---there are so many trees, so many flowers, fruits. We, we want varieties of pleasure. Variety is the mother of...

**Devotees:**
"Variety is the spice of life."

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Himāvatī:**
Spice of life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Yes. So therefore, we are living entities, life. We want variety. So this is the varietyless, no variety, one kind, sunlight. We require sunlight. We are so much anxious for sunlight. Not only sunlight.

**Revatīnandana:**
It must get very boring. It is very boring in the //brahma-jyotir?// You get very bored? There is nothing to do? Nowhere to go?

**Prabhupāda:**
Bore?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Boring, dull.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Himāvatī:**
But at first they are satisfied, aren't they, that they've achieved their goal?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. They do not know. They are after //brahmaṇanda,// transcendental pleasure, but they do not know what is actually transcendental pleasure, impersonalists. Therefore their intelligence is not clean. They go to the spiritual kingdom, transcendental platform, but they do not that know, how real transcendental pleasure can be achieved. Therefore their knowledge is not perfect.

**Revatīnandana:**
When they want to come back, is it very easy for them to come back or have they got to...?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they automatically come back because he is hankering after varieties. So that variety is not there, so he is attracted again in the material world. Just like so many //sannyāsīs.// Take Vivekananda. He wanted to lecture on Vedānta, which is liberation. He came again back to the hospitalizing and philanthropic work because he could not find the variety of pleasure in Vedānta. Of course, he was not very much advanced. There are many. There is a... //Sannyāsī// is here. he's a //Kārpātrī.// He is very learned and other... He was formerly speaking on Vedānta and other... Now he is in politics and cow protection. You see? There are many.

**Revatīnandana:**
I have a hazy memory that one time I heard that when a soul, when it finally does enter into //brahma-jyotir,// that he has to remain there for some long duration of time, a daytime of Brahmā or a lifetime of Brahmā. Is that correct? What is that duration?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not that. That is not like that.

**Revatīnandana:**
Not like that. Thank you.

**Prabhupāda:**
But he feels inconvenience without varieties of life. The //Bhāgavata// says, //tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ:// "Their intelligence is not clean." //Arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ:// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]] "Although they rise up to the //brahma-jyotir," patanty adho tataḥ,// "they again come back."

**Haṁsadūta:**
And the //nirvāṇa// conception of life is just before Brahman?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nirvāṇa// conception is marginal position between //brahma-jyotir// and this material world.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Just on the brink.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Kāraṇārṇava. Kāraṇārṇava.// The Kāraṇa Ocean wherefrom the beginning of creation, material creation, that is //nirvāṇa.//

**Devotee (4):**
//Virajā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Virajā,// yes.

**Revatīnandana:**
Is it possible to go there?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not? Yes.

**Devotee (4):**
Arjuna went there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Revatīnandana:**
What was Arjuna's purpose?

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa took him to show His friend. He did not go alone. That he could not. No. [laughter] It was Kṛṣṇa's chariot.

**Revatīnandana:**
So he went to the spiritual sky?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Then what is the use of making friendship with Kṛṣṇa if you cannot do so? There was a rich man in Calcutta, Motilal Sill. He was so rich that... Every man has different circle in younger days. So he would see. If any of his friends did not possess a house in Calcutta, he would purchase house. He said that, "If people say, 'Oh, you are friend of Motilal Sill. You have no your own house?' what people will say about me? He must have his own house." He purchased house for him. He was very big man. And there are many incidences also like, a very noble story. Actually it was not long ago, say about hundred years ago. He would not see that any one of his associates, friends, does not possess a house in Calcutta. Another Kṛṣṇa's friend, Sudama also. [chuckles] He could not recognize his own place, how it had happened, palatial buildings, garden. In //Kṛṣṇa,// you have not read Sudama? Give me water.

**Yamunā:**
[indistinct] mentions in the //Teachings of Lord Caitanya// that a devotee in attachment selects one of the Vṛndāvana..., the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, and follows in his footsteps in order to be successful in his own devotional service. Does that mean that one of our spiritual masters is an eternal representative of Vṛndāvana? [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that? Let me...

**Yamunā:**
It says, "All inhabitants of Vrajabhūmi, Vṛndāvana, are very dear to Kṛṣṇa. A devotee in attachment selects one of the inhabitants and follows in his footsteps in order to be successful."

**Prabhupāda:**
Devotee... Devoted to the Vṛndāvana inhabitants. You don't directly think of yourself that "I shall see Kṛṣṇa as my son."

**Yamunā:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Yamunā:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is //Māyāvāda.//

**Yamunā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have to follow the footsteps of Yasoda Ma.

**Yamunā:**
Yes. You've told me that before.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then it will be success.

**Revatīnandana:**
But you've said that you are always in Vṛndāvana, so we are following a Vṛndāvana inhabitant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [laughter]

**Yamunā:**
It says, "One should always remember the activities of that particular inhabitant of Vraja."

**Prabhupāda:**
Now you have got Kapoor[?] daughter?

**Devotee (4):**
Yes.

**Revatīnandana:**
Have we got an engagement this morning?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Haṁsadūta:**
He asked if we have an engagement this morning. 8:30.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Molpar[?], yes. They'll send car?

**Yamunā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
How far it is?

**Haṁsadūta:**
It's supposed to be just in the neighborhood.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's all. He was formerly prince.

**Revatīnandana:**
Of this area?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Haṁsadūta:**
He had given [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the sign of princely opulence.

**Revatīnandana:**
He's the son of the man we saw last week? This Mahārāja? It's not his son?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, he is also old man.

**Haṁsadūta:**
I won't be going to that place because I'll be waiting for Mr. Homing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Homing is coming?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes. [indistinct] we'll open a bank account.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it.

**Haṁsadūta:**
We'll open a one-sided account.

**Prabhupāda:**
Book fund account and one, International Society, checking account. [devotees offer obeisances] So what we have to do in that connection?

**Devotee (4):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
The water? [break] Where is your son? [Hindi] This is material conception. [Hindi] [end]
