**Prabhupāda:**
You understand what is the meaning of //Bhāgavata,// this word, //Bhāgavata?// You understand? These are the common questions. If you do not understand this common question then how you can instruct others?

**Guest (1):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right but do not take the position of a teacher unless you have assimilated the whole thing. Simply by hearing others you may misunderstand, you may not present the real thing. Therefore I'm asking you...

**Guest (1):**

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [indistinct] but you must know. Another thing is that you must know //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// from a //bhāgavata,// whose life is //bhāgavata.// First of all you must know what is //bhāgavata.// What is //bhāgavata?// Can you give me idea what you have understood? Instead of going through the instruction, first of all let me understand what do you understand about this [indistinct] //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// That is essential. So you cannot explain what is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// You have read //Bhāgavatam// from the beginning? //Dharma projjhita kaitavo atra.// You have read?

**Guest (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? You have not read even the first verse and you are going to give instruction on //Bhāgavatam?// Your life should be //bhāgavata.// You should understand what is //bhāgavata.// Simply by [indistinct] words from others how can you accept?

**Guest (1):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? So I bless[?] you that you try to understand. Then you write. That is my request. That's alright, alright. [end]
