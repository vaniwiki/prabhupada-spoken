**Prabhupāda:**
Mosquito?

**Devotee (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [laughter] Many, many? Without mosquito curtain you cannot sleep.

**Devotee (1):**
No, we can sleep. At Advaita Bhavan there's a fair amount of mosquitos at night, but there's not so many that you can't sleep without a mosquito coil burning.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. [break]

**Devotee (2):**
The rats in Hawaii are not so big as the rats here. They're only about this big, the body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Every house there is rats?

**Devotee (2):**
Not every house, no.

**Prabhupāda:**
At least Advaita Bhavan has got.

**Devotee (2):**
They were some but they cleaned them out. They got rid of them. I'm not sure rats actually are poisoned.

**Devotee (3):**
[unintelligible]

**Devotee (2):**
We were getting a cow but we joined ISKCON just before we got the cow. We were going to get one for four hundred dollars. It was giving sixteen quarts a day and had a calf.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sixteen quarts?

**Devotee (2):**
A day, yes. There was a small calf also.

**Prabhupāda:**
There must be grazing ground for cows. Then there is no problem.

**Devotee (2):**
There was a grazing ground. The lawn must grow.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that? Are they cutting? These are not important thing. [end]
