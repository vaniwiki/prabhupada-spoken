**Prabhupāda:**

> aho bhāgyam aho bhāgyaṁ
> nanda-gopa-vrajaukasām
> yan-mitraṁ paramānandaṁ
> pūrṇaṁ brahma sanātanam

I think I shall speak in Hindi? What is that? I shall speak in English? Then they will take advantage of. That is... Why you have gone?

**Yamunā:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, I see. So this was a part of the prayer offered by Brahmājī when he offended on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. The incident... Perhaps you know that Kṛṣṇa was a cowherd boy in Vṛndāvana. [speaks in Hindi with some Indians] Why you are back side? You can come this side. So Brahmājī is praising the fortune of the residents of Vṛndāvana, //vrajaukasām,// headed by... //Vrajaukasām// means the residents of the Vrajabhūmi, headed by Nanda Mahārāja. //Aho bhāgyam aho bhāgyaṁ nanda-gopa-vrajaukasām, yan mitraṁ paramānandaṁ brahma.// Kṛṣṇa was there.

So Brahmā is admitting that this Kṛṣṇa is //parabrahman sanātanam.// So we have to take evidence from the authorities. There are twelve authorities according to //śāstra.// Brahmā is one of the authorities. Twelve authorities means,

> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kapilaḥ kumāro manuḥ
> prahlādo janako bhīṣmo
> [balir] vaiyāsakir vayam
> [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]

//Svayambhūr nāradaḥ.// Svayambhūḥ is Brahmā; Nārada; then Śambhu, Lord Śiva. //Svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ kapilaḥ// [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]. Kapila. Kapila is incarnation of God, Kapiladeva, the propounder of the Sāṅkhya philosophy. Kumāra, the four Kumāras, ever //brahmacārī.// And Manu, Vaivasvata Manu, the father of Mahārāja Ikṣvāku. And Prahlāda, the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu. The father was atheist and the son was a devotee, great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Then Janaka Mahārāja, the father of Sītādevī. And Bhīṣma, the grandfather of the Pāṇḍavas. //Prahlādo janako bhīṣmaḥ.// Then Vaiyāsaki, Śukadeva Gosvāmī; and Yamarāja, they are authorities.

Now, here the Brahmā, the first authority, he is admitting Kṛṣṇa as Brahman, //pūrṇa-brahma sanātanam, pūrṇa-brahma, bhagavān.// Brahman realization, there are stages, three stages of Brahman realization: first, impersonal Brahman, then localized Brahman, then full Brahman. Localized Brahman is Paramātmā, who is situated in everyone's heart. The example is given: just like the sun. The sun is one and the sun is the abode of the sun-god, Vaivasvata. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// you have to admit,

> imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
> proktavān aham avyayam
> vivasvān manave prāha
> manu ikṣvākave 'bravīt
> [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]

So this Vivasvān, the sun-god, he heard from Kṛṣṇa for the first time about the yoga system stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa spoke and the sun-god heard; therefore he is a person. And the sun-god's abode is the sun planet. And from the sun planet, the effulgence, the sunshine, is coming. By this example one can understand what is Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān---//tattva-vastu,// the Absolute Truth. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The Absolute Truth... [aside:] Not like that. Don't sit... Not like that. Why don't you tell him? The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases. The first realization is impersonal Brahman, the next, higher realization is the Paramātmā, //antaryāmī,// and the ultimate realization is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

> vadanti tat tattva-vidas
> tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam
> brahmeti paramātmeti
> bhagavān iti śabdyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]

This is Absolute Truth in three phases.

So here the Absolute Truth, when He is realized as the Supreme Person, as Brahmā is realizing, //yan-mitram...// He is realizing that Kṛṣṇa, who is playing as a cowherd boy in Vṛndāvana, and He has become the most intimate friend of the residents of Vṛndāvana, headed by Nanda Mahārāja... Nanda Mahārāja was the //zamindar rāja.// He was //vaiśya.// He had 900,000's of cows, and he was the head of Vṛndāvana. All other cowherds men were his tenants or friends or family members. So Kṛṣṇa automatically became their very, very dear friend. That is the significance of the residents of Vṛndāvana. They... Their love for Kṛṣṇa was so ecstatic that they did not know anything except Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Brahmā says, //aho bhāgyam aho bhāgyam:// "How fortunate these residents of Vṛndāvana are that Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, has become their friend." And Kṛṣṇa is //pūrṇa-brahma sanātanam,// not that He has assumed a body like a human being and He is imperson. No. Just like Māyāvādī philosophers, they take it, they concoct like that, that "Ultimately the Absolute Truth is impersonal, but when He descends..." I do not know how the impersonal can be "He." So that theory is refuted hereby because it is the statement of Brahmā, and he says that Kṛṣṇa is //pūrṇa-brahma sanātanam.//

Then Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,

> apāṇi-pāda-śruti varje prākṛta pāṇi-caraṇa
> punaḥ kahe śīghra cale kare sarva grahaṇa

This is the process is describing a spiritual understanding, with reference to the Vedic injunction. Now, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu is giving Vedic reference. He says, //apāṇi-pāda.// This is a reference from the //Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad.// In the //Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// there is statement, impersonally, but referring to the person, transcendental person. The //mantra// is like this:

> apāṇi-pādo javano grahītā
> paśyaty acakṣuḥ sa śṛnoty akarṇaḥ
> sa vetti vedyaṁ na ca tasyāsti vettā
> tam āhur agryaṁ puruṣaṁ mahāntam

//Puruṣam. Puruṣam// means person, but the Vedic //mantra// begins, //apāṇi-pāda:// "Person, but has no leg and no hand." There are two kinds of statements: that He is person, //puruṣa, mahānta,// the greatest person, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is a person; but //apāṇi-pāda,// but He has no legs and no hands. So how is that? A person has no legs and no hands, and still, He accepts whatever we offer? Just like Kṛṣṇa says, //tad aham aśnāmi, bhaktyā upahṛtam aśnāmi:// "Anyone who offers Me anything," //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]], "with devotion," //bhaktyā...// The very word is //bhaktyā.// That means Kṛṣṇa is transcendental person, and the Vedic //mantra// confirms. When the Vedic //mantra// says, //apāṇi-pāda,// "no hands, no legs," that is not imperson. "Person, but His hands and legs are not like us," that is //apāṇi-pāda.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu explains that. //Apāṇi-pāda śruti varje prākṛta pāṇi-caraṇa:// "When the Vedic //mantra// says that 'The Absolute Truth has no legs and no hands,' that means that the Personality of Godhead's hands and legs are not material." That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's explanation.

> apāṇi-pāda śruti, veda-mantra, varje prakṛta pāṇi-caraṇa
> na kahe śīghra cale kare sarva grahaṇa

"And although the Vedic //mantra// says that 'The Absolute Truth has no legs, no hands,' still, it confirms that 'He can accept whatever you offer, and He can walk more speedily than anyone.' Then He walks; at the same time, He has no legs. And He accepts your offering; He has no hands." What does it mean? Apparently it is contradictory. If He has no leg, then how He can walk more speedily than anyone? These are Vedic //mantras.// "Nobody can capture Him, He is walking so speedily." But if He has no leg, how He is walking? But that, Caitanya Mahāprabhu explains that //varje prākṛta pāṇi-caraṇa:// "This means that the Supreme Personality of Godhead has no material body."

In the //Kūrma Purāṇa// it is said that the Supreme Personality, the Para-brahman, has no distinction between His body and self. There is no... Absolute means there is no duality as we have got duality---"I am," the soul, and this body, they are different. Therefore //śāstra// says, //yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke:// [SB 10.84.13] "If anyone accepts this body as self..." This body is made of three //dhātus: kapha, pitta, vāyu.// I am not this. And //Bhagavad-gītā// also says,

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
> tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ...
> [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]

So //dehi. Dehi// means possessor of this body, the owner of this body. So owner of this body is different from this body. But in case of Kṛṣṇa or //Viṣṇu-tattva,// there is no such difference, the self and the body, no difference. That is confirmed in the //Kūrma Purāṇa.// Unfortunately the Māyāvādīs, they, either due to their poor fund of knowledge of the //śāstras// or by their whims, they say that "Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu, when comes, or the Absolute Truth when He descends, He assumes, He accepts, a material body." That is not the fact. Kṛṣṇa says, //sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā// [[books:bg:4:6|[Bg. 4.6]]]. It is not that Kṛṣṇa accepts a material body. No. Kṛṣṇa has no such distinction, material world. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam:// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]] "Because I present myself, descend Myself as a human being, the //mūḍhas,// or the rascals, they think of Me or deride at Me." The Māyāvādīs, they will never worship the transcendental form of the Lord. They'll not worship. They will worship the imperson. And Kṛṣṇa has said, //kleśo adhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām.// Of course, impersonal, personal, is the same Absolute Truth. But if you try to reach the Absolute Truth through His impersonal attachment, then it will be more troublesome. The //jñānīs,// those who want to understand the Absolute Truth by their material, imperfect knowledge, how... //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. Our manipulation of the senses is not possible to understand what is Kṛṣṇa.

The Vedic //mantra// also it is said, //nayam ātmā pravacanena labhyaḥ:// "You cannot realize the //ātmā,// you cannot be self-realized, simply by talking. You may be very big speaker, nice speaker, but that is not the process---simply by speaking very nicely you can understand the Absolute Truth." //Nayam ātmā pravacanena labhya na medhayā:// "Neither you can understand the Absolute Truth because you have got a very nice brain, a great scientist." Then Sir Isaac Newton would have discovered what is God, or Professor Einstein or Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, they could have understand. No, they cannot. Because they have very nice, finer tissues of the brain, it does not mean. It is a different process. It is a... To understand God or Kṛṣṇa, it is not material process. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. Only through devotional service He can be known. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. Kṛṣṇa is covered by the curtain drawn by //yogamāyā;// therefore Kṛṣṇa cannot be understood by everyone, neither His teaching, //Bhagavad-gītā,// can be understood without becoming a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. This is not possible. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna that //bhakto 'si priyo 'si me:// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]] "Because you are My very dear friend, therefore I shall speak to you." //Rahasyaṁ hy etad uttamam:// "Without you, nobody can understand." Arjuna was a military man. He was not a //brāhmaṇa,// neither a Vedantist. You cannot expect a military man, a //kṣatriya,// to be highly learned in Vedic scriptures. That is not possible. They hear from the //brāhmaṇas.// The //brāhmaṇas,// they are expected to be highly learned scholars in //Vedas// because that is their department. //Jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. //Brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ. Brāhmaṇa...// Therefore we call //brāhmaṇa,// "//paṇḍita, paṇḍitajī.//" //Paṇḍitajī// has never seen the pages of //Vedas,// but still, he is going on under the name of //paṇḍitajī.// So that kind of //paṇḍitajī// not wanted. Actually a //brāhmaṇa// means he is truthful. And one of the greatest commentator of //Bhagavad-gītā,// Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, he says truthful means one should be truthful even to his enemies. Sometimes we have to hide something from the enemies. That is diplomacy. But Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa says, "A //brāhmaṇa// should be so truthful that he will disclose everything to his enemy also." //Satyam. Titikṣa ārjavam śuci śama dama//---these are the qualifications. //Jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]].

So without this brahminical qualification one cannot understand the Vedic knowledge. Therefore it is stated sometimes that a //śūdra// is prohibited from reading //Vedas.// That does not mean that reading of Vedic culture or Vedic knowledge is monopolized by a certain class of men. Not that. The idea is... Just like in our ordinary educational system, there is some prohibition that unless one is graduate, he cannot be admitted in the law college. That is not a prohibition; that is the necessary qualification to understand. Similarly, to understand the //Vedas,// the necessary qualification is that one must be a qualified //brāhmaṇa.// Not that Mr. Max Muller, he has got little knowledge of Sanskrit and he translates. That kind of translation is no use, just like so many commentaries on the //Bhagavad-gītā// without becoming a devotee of Kṛṣṇa is useless. It has no meaning, because Kṛṣṇa says that //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti:// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]] "Only through devotional service one can understand Me." How a nondevotee can understand Him? He has no scope to enter into the knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā.// So first qualification is that he must be a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Then it will be revealed.

In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata// there is a verse,

> athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-
> prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi
> jānāti tattvaṁ [bhagavan-mahimno]
> na cānya eko 'pi ciraṁ vicinvan
> [SB 10.14.29]

"My dear Lord, one who has a little, I mean to say, favorable connection with Your lotus feet, he can understand You." //Athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-prasāda:// "One who has got a little //prasāda// from Your lotus feet, such person can understand You." //Prasāda-leśānu..., jānāti tattvam:// "He can understand what You are." Kṛṣṇa says that,

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

To understand Kṛṣṇa is not very easy job. Kṛṣṇa says, "Out of many millions of men, one is trying to become perfect in this human form of life." Not everyone is trying. First of all one has to become //brāhmaṇa// or acquire the brahminical qualification. That is the platform of //sattva-guṇa.// Unless one comes to the platform of //sattva-guṇa,// there is no question of perfection. Nobody can understand, nobody can achieve perfection on the platform of //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// because one who is addicted with //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// he is always very greedy and lusty. //Tato rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. One who is infected with the material qualities of ignorance and passion, he is lusty and greedy. That's all. Therefore you will see, generally people are very much lusty and greedy. They are accumulating money, //crores// and //crores;// still, they are not satisfied. In Western country we see very usually. There are many, many workers, working very hard from very poor state. Just like Henry Ford, Mr. Rockefeller, they started life from a very humble state, but they accumulated immense wealth, and still, they were not satisfied. In our country also there are many Birlas and such, accumulating money, money, money. They are greedy because infected with the quality, modes of nature, ignorance and passion. //Vaiśya// means passion and ignorance, //kṣatriya// means passion, and //brāhmaṇa// means goodness. These are the different qualities. So one has to come to the platform of goodness. Then he has to transcend the platform of goodness, come to the pure transcendental platform, //vāsudeva, sattvaṁ-viśuddham, sattva-guṇa.// In this material world, //sattva-guṇa// is also sometimes mixed with //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// That is the nature. So one has to transcend the platform of //sattva-guṇa. Śuddha-sattva. Sattvaṁ viśuddhaṁ vasudeva-śabditam.// That is the //vasudeva// platform, when Kṛṣṇa appears.

So //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. So generally people are addicted, infected with the qualities of ignorance and passion. How he can understand Kṛṣṇa? It is not possible. So one has to engage himself this devotional service. Then you can... You may argue that "How these Europeans and Americans...? They are supposed to be in ignorance and passion. How they are coming to the platform of transcendental platform of pure goodness?" That is possible. That is possible by the execution of //Bhāgavata-dharma. Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. //Tato rajas-tamo bhāvāḥ.// There are verses in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. One has to hear. Therefore //śravaṇa// and //kīrtana,// hearing and chanting, is very important, //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ,// especially hearing and chanting of Kṛṣṇa. //Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet// [SB 12.3.51]. Simply by discussing and hearing and reciting //Bhagavad-gītā// purely, not by interpreting wrongly... As it is. As Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], you have to accept that. You cannot change that. You cannot say, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa; it is the Kṛṣṇa's self and this and that." So //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.// One who hears //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is or //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// from devotees... //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.// Because simply by hearing he achieves the result of pious activities... And Kṛṣṇa says also in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that "One can be engaged in My service, in devotional service, who is freed from all contamination of sinful life."

> yeṣāṁ [tv] anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmāṇam
> te dvanda-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ

Unless one is freed from all contamination of sinful life, one cannot concentrate in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa says.

So the process is, as it is recommended in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ:// simply you sit down and hear what Kṛṣṇa says. Don't comment wrongly, whimsically. Don't gratify your senses. Submissively, //namanta...// As Caitanya Mahāprabhu also recommends from //Bhāgavata, jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva.// Just be submissive, //bhavadīya-vārtām,// and try to hear Kṛṣṇa submissively. Then you'll benefit. If you make your own commentation, then you will be wrongly directed. You have too... Therefore Kṛṣṇa said,

> evaṁ paramparā-prāptam
> imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ
> sa kālena
> yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa
> [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]

Because the //paramparā// system was lost, therefore Kṛṣṇa said that "The system recommended in the //Bhagavad...,// is lost off. Therefore I am speaking again to you the same yoga system." So one has to receive the knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā// by the //paramparā// system. Just like Arjuna. Arjuna heard //Bhagavad-gītā.// And how he understood //Bhagavad-gītā?// He understood Kṛṣṇa as a person. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān, puruṣaṁ śāśvatam ādyam// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. That is real //Bhagavad-gītā// understanding. And Arjuna said, //sarvam etam ṛtaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi keśava.// As Kṛṣṇa says that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], so he accepted that. That is //Bhagavad-gītā// reading, not that "It is not to person Kṛṣṇa; it is to His self," and this and that. No. Therefore we are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.//

So it is very unfortunate that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, accepted by all the //ācāryas,// not only at the present age, previously also... Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Asita, Devala, they are all great //ācāryas.// And in the recent years, Śaṅkarācārya, he also admitted. Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Lord Caitanya---all these authorities, they are accepting Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Then how is that---a less intelligent class of men, they are commenting differently? That is not good. They may comment, they go on talking all nonsense, but no sane man will accept them. That is a different thing. But those who are sane, they should judge over this, that "Why we should deny, that 'God is impersonal'? God is person. Kṛṣṇa came." Kṛṣṇa exhibited His godly potencies, energies, when He was present. There is no... In the history you won't find another second person like Kṛṣṇa in the whole history of the world. Apart from other points of view, //Bhagavad-gītā,// that is admitted, spoken by Kṛṣṇa, such deep, profound knowledge---there is no second imitation or second copy like //Bhagavad-gītā// in the whole world. That is admitted by all scholars, all religionists. Therefore He is //pūrṇa-jñāna, pūrṇa-brahma. Bhagavad-gītā// is //pūrṇa-jñāna.// The Bhagavān's one qualification---He is fully wise. Nobody is wiser than Him. That is one of the qualifications. Nobody is richer than Him, nobody is powerful than Him, nobody is influential than Him, nobody is beautiful than Him, and nobody is renouncer than Him. //Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya.// That will be explained.

So Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, admitted by all //ācāryas.// And on the basis of that authority, we are preaching all over the world that "You are searching after God? Here is God." //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam. Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.// In the //Bhāgavata// has given different list of different incarnation of God but ultimately concludes that //ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam:// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]] "All the incarnations, they are parts or parts of the parts." //Aṁśa// means part, and //kalāḥ// means part of the part. "But //svayaṁ pūrṇa-bhagavān, ṣoḍaśa-kala pūrṇa, ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇa-bhagavān// is Kṛṣṇa." That is the verdict all //Vedas,// all //śāstras.// So we should also accept in that light. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. And Kṛṣṇa also says personally, //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ:// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]] "I am the origin of even Brahma, Śiva, and Viṣṇu also." //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.// So from any...

Now, here Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that Kṛṣṇa is person, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is person, but He is not a person like us. That is difference. But less intelligent persons, they think Kṛṣṇa, as soon as He is a person, "He is a person like us." That is a mistake. He is not a person like any one of us. Therefore He is confirmed by the Vedas, //apāṇi-pāda javano grahītā:// "This Absolute Truth has no leg or hand; still, He can walk very swiftly and He can accept anything you offer." That means His hands and legs are not like ours. That is transcendental. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu is trying to explain before Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya that the Absolute Truth is a person, a person like you and me. //Cetana... Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. He is the Supreme Person, the chief person. We are all also individuals, Kṛṣṇa is also individual, but He is the chief and we are subordinate. That is the way.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] God is not poor man, but you are mismanaging. [Hindi] [end]
