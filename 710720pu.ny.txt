**Prabhupāda:**
So you know this song //Jaya Rādhā-Mādhava?//

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can follow me?

**Devotees:**
//Jaya! Haribol!// (Śrīla Prabhupāda leads singing of //Jaya Rādhā-Mādhava//)

**Prabhupāda:**
So this is the-sit down-original nature of Kṛṣṇa, original nature of Kṛṣṇa. He is Rādhā-Mādhava. He is the lover of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. And //kuñja-vihārī,// always enjoying the company of the gopīs within the bushes of Vrdavana forest. //Rādhā-mādhava kuñja-vihārī.// So He's not only lover of Rādhārāṇī, but //braja-jana-vallabha.// The whole residents of Vṛndāvana, they love Kṛṣṇa. They do not know anything else. They do not know whether Kṛṣṇa is God, or not; neither they are very much harassed, that "I shall love Kṛṣṇa if He is God." "He may be God or He may be whatever He is. It doesn't matter, but we love God, Kṛṣṇa." That's all. That is called unnalloyed love. "If Kṛṣṇa is God, then I shall love Him"---this is conditional love. This is not pure love. Kṛṣṇa may be God or whatever He may be, but by His wonderful acts, the //Vrajavāsī,// they are thinking, "Oh Kṛṣṇa, He is very wonderful child, maybe some demigod. Maybe some demigod." Because people are generally under impression that the demigods are all-powerful. They're powerful within this material world. But they do not know that Kṛṣṇa is above all of them. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. The highest demigod, Brahmā, is giving his opinion, "The supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa."

So as the residents of Vṛndāvana, they love Kṛṣṇa without any condition, similarly, Kṛṣṇa also loves them without any condition. //Vraja-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhārī.// When the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana were in danger because they stopped //Indra-yajña// and Indra became very angry, and he sent very great, powerful cloud and rained over Vṛndāvana incessantly for seven days, so when the inhabitants became very much disturbed, Kṛṣṇa, although He was only seven years old boy, He saved them by lifting the Govardhana Hill. So He taught Indradeva, demigod, that "To stop your disturbance is the business of My little finger. That's all." So he came down to his knees. These things you'll find in //Kṛṣṇa// book. So as the //Gopī-jana-vallabha,// His only business is how to protect //gopī-jana.// So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is how to become one of the //gopī-jana.// Then Kṛṣṇa will save us from any danger, even by lifting a hill or mountain. Kṛṣṇa is so kind and so powerful. When Kṛṣṇa lifted the hill, He did not practice some yoga system. And that is God. Although He was a child, He was playing like a child, He was dealing like a child, but when there was need, He was manifesting as God. That is Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa, not that He has to go and practice some yoga system. Then He becomes God. No. He's not that type of God, not manufactured God. He's God.

So //gopī-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhārī.// And as a child, as beloved child of Yaśodā, Yaśodā-nandana,... Kṛṣṇa likes to be a child of a devotee. He wants to be chastised from His devotee father and mother. Because everyone worships Him, nobody goes to chastise Him, so He takes pleasure when a devotee chastises Him. That is Kṛṣṇa's service. If Kṛṣṇa takes pleasure being chastised, so the responsibility is taken by a devotee: "All right, I shall become Your father and chastise You." When Kṛṣṇa wants to fight, one of His devotees becomes Hiraṇyakaśipu and fights with Him. So all activities of Kṛṣṇa is with His devotees. He is... Therefore, to become associate of Kṛṣṇa, to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness... //Yaśodā-nandana vraja-jana-vallabha, vraja-jana-rañjana.// His only business is how to satisfy... As //braja-jana//'s business is how to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, similarly, Kṛṣṇa's business is how to satisfy //braja-jana.// This is reciprocation of love. //Yamunā-tīra-vana-cārī.// Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is wandering on the banks of Yamunā to please the //gopīs,// the cowherd boys, the birds, beasts, calves. They are not ordinary birds, beasts, calves or men. They are on the top of self-realization. //Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ// [[books:sb:10:12:7-11|[SB 10.12.11]]]. After many, many lives they got that position, to play with Kṛṣṇa.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so nice that everyone can go to Kṛṣṇaloka and become His associate, as a friend or so many other things, as a servant, as father, as mother. And Kṛṣṇa is agreeable to any one of these propositions. These things are described very nicely in our Teachings of Lord Caitanya. So Kṛṣṇa does not go even a step from Vṛndāvana. The original Kṛṣṇa is Vṛndāvana. That is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,//

> cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-
> lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
> lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambrahma-sevyamānaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ (tam ahaṁ bhajāmi)
> [Bs. 5.29]

Brahmā is accepting the Supreme Personality of Govinda, Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana. //Veṇuṁ kvaṇantam:// "He is engaged in playing flute."

> (veṇuṁ kvaṇantam) aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ
> barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam
> kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.30]

So take advantage of these books, this knowledge, and this //prasādam,// this chanting, and be happy and go to Kṛṣṇa. So nice thing. All right. (end)
