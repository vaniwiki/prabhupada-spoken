Vārāṇasī dāsī. Vārāṇasī, the sacred conjunction of two rivers, Vāruṇī and Asī. Vāruṇī is Ganges, and Asī. So combination of two sacred rivers flowing from the lotus toe of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Puṣpavana. Puṣpavana is the name of Cupid. He throws the arrow of flower. And Kṛṣṇa is the supreme Cupid. You know the rules and regulation? Yes. Come on. (sings softly) //Rādhe jaya jaya mādhava dayite, gokula taruṇī maṇḍala...// Hm?

**Aravinda:**
Puṣkara.

**Prabhupāda:**
Puṣkara dāsa. There is a sacred lake in India, Puṣkara tīrtha. Puṣkara tīrtha. So anyone who takes bath in that lake, he becomes a devotee. So you try to bring all people of the world to take bath in Puṣkara.

**Aravinda:**
Tapas.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tapas. From //tapasya.// You have to perform severe austerity. Without severe austerity nobody can achieve Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ// [[books:sb:10:12:7-11|[SB 10.12.11]]]. After many, many births' pious activities and austerity one can understand Kṛṣṇa. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānām// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. //Siddhānām,// those who have attained perfection, out of many of them, one can understand Kṛṣṇa. So by Lord Caitanya's grace we are distributing freely such thing, Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]], Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Hare Kṛṣṇa. You know the rules and regulation? Then you come. [break] Open. You take this and... Yes. First of all take this. Then care of... Stand up. This side. Now where is that //mantra?// You chant this //mantra.// (Trivikrama repeats) //Etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām upāsitāṁ pūrvatamair maha...// What is this? It is not properly... Oh. //Pūrvatamair mahadbhir ahaṁ tariṣyāmi duranta-pāraṁ tamo mukundam aṅghri niṣevayaiva.// Yes. //Etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhā.// This vow-today you are taking //sannyāsa//---so keeping oneself steady and fixed up in this position, //etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhā... Parātmā,// the Supreme Lord... //Jīva,// living entities, they are //ātmā,// and Kṛṣṇa is //parātmā. Paramātmā// and //parātmā.// So //parātmā-niṣṭhām,// to serve Kṛṣṇa. So "Taking //sannyāsa,// from this day my vow to serve Kṛṣṇa is more fixed up, steady." //Upāsitāṁ pūrvatamair mahadbhiḥ:// "This practice, this process was accepted by my previous //ācāryas.//" Your spiritual master, his spiritual master, his spiritual master, they all accepted this. Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted at the age of twenty-four years. Therefore it is not a new introduction. //Pūrvatamaiḥ. Pūrvatamaiḥ// means previous //ācārya,// they accepted it, //sannyāsa āśrama.// That is Vedic civilization. Everyone has to accept //sannyāsa āśrama// at a certain period, generally at the end. But one who is advanced, he can take //sannyāsa// even at young age. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu took //sannyāsa,// Rāmānujācārya took //sannyāsa// very young age. My Guru Mahārāja took //sannyāsa// at very young age. So it is not that only old men should take //sannyāsa,// but there are many instances. Why? Now, //parātma-niṣṭhā. Etāṁ sa āsthāya ahaṁ tariṣyāmi:// "I shall cross over." //Tariṣyāmi// means cross over. //Duranta-pāram:// "which is very difficult to overcome." //Tamo:// "this darkness." This material world is dark. //Tamasi mā jyotir gama.// Vedic injunction is, "Don't remain in this darkness. Go the other side, //jyoti,// where there is..." //Na tad bhāsayate sūryaḥ.// There is another nature, where there is no need of sun, no need of moon, no need of electricity. There //jyoti... Jyoti// means effulgent light, only light. So we have to cross over this ocean of darkness and reach that //jyotir dhāma. Jyotirmāyā dhāma, brahma-jyotir. Tamo mukundāṅghri.// How it will be possible? Mukunda. Mukunda means... //Muk// means //mukti,// or liberation. So one who gives liberation and gives //ānanda...// Unless one is liberated, one cannot understand what is //ānanda,// or pleasure. Here in the material world we are trying to be happy by false pleasure. Actual pleasure... Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure. When we serve Kṛṣṇa, //mukundāṅghri... Aṅghri// means lotus feet, leg. When we appoint ourself, engage ourself in the service of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who can deliver liberation and transcendental bliss... //Tamo mukundāṅghri niṣevayaiva:// "Only by serving Him I shall be able." This //mantra// you shall take copy. Also Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja, you can read this portion and...

**Kīrtanānanda:**
[break] "...they misunderstand the purpose of //tridaṇḍa,// and by such deviation..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Our, this //daṇḍa,// there are four sticks. One stick is representing the //jīva// soul, another stick is representing body, another stick is mind, and another stick, speech. //Kaya mana vākya.// So the //jīva// engages himself with his body, mind, and words for preaching work. Go on. So there is another sect of //sannyāsī, Māyāvādī sannyāsī.// They take one stick, //eka.//

**Kīrtanānanda:**
"They misunderstand the purpose of //tridaṇḍa,// and by such deviation..." (indistinct)

**Prabhupāda:**
Śiva Swami? What is that?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
S-i-v-a?

**Prabhupāda:**
Śiva Swami. All right.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
"...accepted //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsa// order, but His acceptance of //tridaṇḍī-sannyāsa// is understood. This //mantra// was first chanted by a learned //brāhmaṇa// of Avantipur after being too much disturbed with the materialistic way of life. (reads //sannyāsa// speech---very faint)"

**Prabhupāda:**
The //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsī// and Māyāvādī //sannyāsī,// they think that accepting //sannyāsa,// they become one with Nārāyaṇa or the Supreme Lord. But our process is different. Our process is that we give up everything material and simply engage ourself in Kṛṣṇa's service with body, mind, and speeches, and as I am, soul. This is the difference. So we should not mix up this //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsī// and //tridaṇḍī sannyāsī.//

**Kīrtanānanda:**
"They have no inclination to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Being very much disgusted with the materialistic way of life, they do not understand the purpose of the //sannyāsa// order. But those who are strictly followers of the Vaiṣṇava principles, they do not accept Māyāvādī way of //sannyāsa.// In the sect of Lord Caitanya..." (indistinct)

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bas.// So you'll get a copy of this. So from this day your only business is to preach and collect alms for Kṛṣṇa. Give me that mango. So I give you first of all. Take this flower. And where is your...? Yes. Give him that flower garland.

**Trivikrama:**
All glories to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Devotee:**
It's something for Your Divine Grace.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. Oh. Chant //govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ.// (end)

Go on. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (initiation begins) (end)
