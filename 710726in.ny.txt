**Aravinda:**
Yogamāyā dāsī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yogamāyā. Yogamāyā, the internal energy of Kṛṣṇa. You are the servant of internal energy. Come on. What are the rules and regulations?

**Yogamāyā:**
No meat-eating, no illicit sex, no gambling, no intoxication.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you agree?

**Yogamāyā:**
(laughs) Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. Come on. Next. (//japa//) [break]

**Aravinda:**
Chāyadevī dāsī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Aravinda:**
Chāyadevī. Chāyadevī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Chāyadevī. Chāyadevī. Chāyadevī means material nature. That is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. Acts according to the direction of Kṛṣṇa. Come on. You know the rules and regulation? All right.

Kaumadakī, born of lotus flower. Come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gandharvikā. Another name of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Come on. You know the rules and regulation?

**Gandharvikā:**
No illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. Thank you. Right hand. Right hand you should... Yes.

**Aravinda:**
Charaṇi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Charaṇi devī. Celestial singers. Come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa. You know the rules and regulations?

**Charaṇi:**
Yes. No illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Come on. (//japa//)

**Aravinda:**
Kapindra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kapindra means Hanumānjī, servant of Lord Rāmacandra. Come on. You know the rules and regulations? That's all right.

**Aravinda:**
Virendra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Virendra. Virendra means Arjuna or Kṛṣṇa. Come on. The supreme hero. Virendra. (//japa//)

**Aravinda:**
Surendra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Surendra is also Kṛṣṇa's another name. Sura means gods, demigods, and the chief, the chief is Kṛṣṇa. Come on.

**Aravinda:**
Viṣṇugadā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Viṣṇu?

**Aravinda:**
Viṣṇugadā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Viṣṇugadā. You know Viṣṇu has got the club? //Śaṅkha cakra gadā padma. Gadā,// the club. So you are that. You have to punish all the demons.

**Aravinda:**
Mahendra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mahendra. Mahā-indra. Mahā-indra is the heavenly king. //Yas tu indra-gopa-mahā indra.// There are two kinds of //indra.// One is a small insect which is called indra-gopa, and beginning from this //indra// up to the //mahā-indra,// the king of heaven, they are all under the reaction of fruitive activities. //Yas tv indra-gopa-mahendra-mahā-sva-karma-phala-bhājanam āta...// Everyone is enjoying and suffering the result of his fruitive activities. //Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām// [Bs. 5.54]. But those who are in devotional service, they have no reaction of their work because they do not work for themselves. They are for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore there is no reaction. So Mahendra means the greatest king within this universe. So because he is representative of Kṛṣṇa, therefore we accept him as one of the devotees. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (aside:) Don't take this. (end)
