**Prabhupāda:**
//...athāpi manaso muni-puṅgavānām. Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo// [Bs. 5.34]. The sky is so vast. This is material sky. We cannot even travel all over the sky. The modern scientist says that you go to the end of the sky cover, it will take forty thousands of years by the light year. This sky is only insignificant portion of the whole sky. You have no information of the whole sky. Nobody has information, the unlimited. The balance sky is spiritual sky. So if you have got any plane which is running on the speed of mind and air... You know the speed of mind, it can run millions of miles in a second. So, if you have got any airplane which runs on the speed of mind, //panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo vāyor athāpi manaso,// either on the plane of air speed or even the mind speed, and you go on with that mind speed, //koṭi-śata-vatsara,// not only forty thousand years, but millions and hundreds of millions of years, and not forty thousand years, //koṭi-śata... Koṭi// means ten million. //Koṭi,// hundred millions //koṭi// means. One //lakh// equal to..., ten //lakh// is equal to one million. Ten millions, //koṭi,// and multiply by hundreds. For that period, if you go on with the speed of mind, still you'll find, //avacintya-tattva,// inconceivable. //Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo vāyor athāpi manaso muni-puṅgavānām.// And that plane made of not ordinary man. //Muni-puṅga,// highest learned, I mean to say, scientist, philosopher. Still //avacintya tattva.//

> panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo
> vāyor athāpi manaso muni-puṅgavānām
> so 'py asti yat-prapada-sīmny avicintya-tattve
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.34]

Still it will remain //avacintya-tattva.//

Avacintya means beyond our conception. Even though you are able to go in high speed, and for so many years, still Kṛṣṇa remains //avacintya-tattva.// Nobody can find out where is Kṛṣṇa's abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana. Therefore, the Māyāvādīs, in desperate frustration, they say that Kṛṣṇa is impersonal, because they want to approach Kṛṣṇa by mundane activities, by mental exercise, mental gymnastic. Kṛṣṇa is not available in that way. Kṛṣṇa is available only to His devotees. Kṛṣṇa is the property of His devotee.

**Prabhupāda:**

**Devotee:**
(chants //praṇāma mantras//)

**Prabhupāda:**
So those who are initiated now, you're path is now open to Kṛṣṇa's abode. //Satāṁ prasaṅga:// by association of devotees. //Satām, satām// means devotees. //Sat, sat// means, that exists eternally, is called //sat.// Kṛṣṇa is //sat, om tat sat.// So devotees are also //sat.// So //satāṁ prasaṅga,// by association... //Prasaṅga// means very intimate association. //Saṅga// means association, and //pra// means still elevated or intimate association. Kṛṣṇa's words, Kṛṣṇa's teachings, Kṛṣṇa's topics, they become very palatable in the association of devotees. In the association of nondevotees one can not understand Kṛṣṇa, neither it becomes very palatable. //Bhagavad-gītā// is well known in your country, since a very long time. There are so many editions of //Bhagavad-gītā// in your country, Indian and foreign editions. Many. But nobody could become a Kṛṣṇa conscious, a Kṛṣṇa's devotee, because they were not discussed amongst the devotees. They took it, //Bhagavad-gītā,// as table talks or some sort of philosophical... They could not seriously understand Kṛṣṇa, because the writing or discussing or discourses took place amongst the nondevotees. //Satāṁ prasaṅgāt.// But if you actually (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa, then you have to talk of Kṛṣṇa amongst devotees. We are opening different centers just to give people chance. They may have intimate association with the devotees. //Satāṁ prasaṅgāt mama vīrya-saṁvido. Vīrya-saṁvida. Vīrya// means full potency. //Mama vīrya-saṁvida bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ. Hṛd// means heart and //karṇa// means ear. //Rasāyanāḥ// means pleasing, very pleasing, tasteful, //rasāyanāḥ.//

So //satāṁ prasaṅgam mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ.// First of all, in order to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness one has to be engaged about Kṛṣṇa. Just like //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa is preaching a philosophy to Arjuna. People try to understand. That is Kṛṣṇa //kathā.// That Kṛṣṇa //kathā// becomes effective when they're discussed within the circle of devotees. //Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]. Actually it is full of potency. Just contrary to this, there is another injunction by Sanātana Gosvāmī: //Avaiṣṇava-mukham gīrṇaṁ puṇyaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam na suryatram.// When Kṛṣṇa //kathā,// Kṛṣṇa topics, is discussed by a person who is not a //vaiṣṇava,// dedicated life to Kṛṣṇa, that is not to be heard. //Avaiṣṇava mukhodgīrṇaṁ pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam śravaṇaṁ na kartavyam.// One fashionable speaker is teaching //Bhagavad-gītā.// Just like the other day a rascal came. He, he's announcing that he's the authority of //Bhagavad-gītā.// You know that rascal? Very well. Yes. He wanted to study from Sanskrit from the rascal. You could not understand that I see. So //śāstra// says, //śravaṇaṁ na kartavyam.// One should not hear from. Why? Kṛṣṇa //kathā// is nice. Why should not be heard from a person who is not a devotee, but he may be scholar? But Sanātana Goswami says, //śravaṇaṁ na kartavyam.// Never. So the reason the example here is given, //sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payo yathā.// Milk, everyone knows milk is very nourishing food, but as soon as it is touched by a serpent it is poison. You can say "Milk is very nice. What is the wrong if it is touched by the serpent?" But Sanātana Goswami warns that it is not to be touched, because it has become now poison. Instead of milk it has become poison. So you should be very careful not to discuss. It is meant for the //kaniṣṭha adhikārī,// those who are neophytes. They may be affected, but those who are strong enough, advanced, they are not affected. But that is different thing, generally.

So we should not discuss Kṛṣṇa //kathā// with a person who is a nondevotee. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has also said like that. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was enquired by one nice householder devotee, "What is the general behavior of a Vaiṣṇava?" He immediately answered, //asat-saṅga-tyāgī vaiṣṇava-ācāra:// "One has to give up the association of //asat.//" //Sat,// I have told you, //sat// means devotee, and //asat// means nondevotee. //Asat-saṅga...// Simply to give up the association of nondevotees. That is //vaiṣṇava-ācāra.// How a Vaiṣṇava should behave, how he should maintain his standard, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says in one word: //asat-saṅga-tyāgī avaiṣṇava-ācāra.// Just like Kṛṣṇa says, //satāṁ prasaṅga mama vīrya-saṁvido.// One can develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness in association with devotee. The same thing Caitanya Mahāprabhu said in a different way, //asat-saṅga-tyāgī,// not to associate with nondevotees. That is //vaiṣṇava-ācāra.// So in future we shall be very careful, all the devotees, not to talk with rascals, nondevotees. It will be impure, it will have poisonous effect, and that will kill Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I do not know how this man was allowed to stay here for so many months. Nobody could detect that here is a serpent?

So you should be very careful in future. That is very easy to understand, who is a serpent. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, because one may inquire, "Who is //asat?// How can I understand?" //asat eka strī-saṅgī kṛṣṇābhakta. Asat// means who is attached to, very much attached to woman. You see that man, he was posing himself as yogi, and he is living with one woman. It was God's grace that he came with that woman so that he disclosed himself. By Kṛṣṇa's grace. //Asat eka strī-saṅgī kṛṣṇābhakta. Strī-saṅgī.// One should not be attached to any woman except his wife. Then he becomes //asat. Asat eka strī-saṅgī kṛṣṇābhakta.// So we should be very careful, //asat,// who is //asat.// It doesn't matter if one is very highly educated; still he should not be associated. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has given instruction that //vidhayalam krto 'pi san// (?) //tyaja durjana-saṁsargam. Durjana-saṁsargam,// association of rascals, nondevotees; //tyaja,// give up. "Oh, he is very learned scholar in Sanskrit, but //vidhalayaṁ kṛto 'pi san,// in spite of his being very learned scholar, you should kick him out." //Vidhalayaṁ kṛto 'pi san.// How is that? Yes, he is giving example, //maṇinā bhūṣitaḥ sarpaḥ kim asau na bhayaṅkaraḥ.// A serpent, you know some serpent has got jewels on the head. Does it mean a serpent with jewel on hood is not ferocious because he has got jewel? He's as ferocious as ordinary serpent. That these things we should know. So I do not know how this man was given shelter in our temple. Nobody could understand that "Here is a serpent," and he was accepted as Sanskrit scholar. So you should be very much careful about this thing in future.

Thank you. (break---followed by lecture, [partially recorded]

You are spirit soul. Woods and stone will not give you any pleasure. That is not possible. You are not wood and stone. You are spirit soul. You must have spiritual food. Therefore, in America especially, despite all material opulences, they..., you are becoming confused and frustrated and disappointed. Because wood and stone will not satisfy you. You must have spiritual food. That is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

Thank you everyone. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)
