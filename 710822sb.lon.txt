**Pradyumna:**
"...by performance of sacrifice at this place, the strength of demoniac people is curtailed. Thus //brāhmaṇas// prefer Naimiṣāraṇya for such sacrificial performances." [[books:sb:1:1:4|[SB 1.1.4]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
So the Vedic literatures, one cannot say that it is concocted. One reference is there, one reference in another place. Sometimes there are some rascal philosophers, they say that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// has been compiled for, I mean to say, eulogizing Kṛṣṇa, who was the son of a leader, [indistinct] like that. So many they manufacture. But you cannot do so, because the reference is there. Very old //Purāṇas.// Some rascal philosopher says //Bhāgavata Purāṇa// was compiled recently. How there is a reference within the //Purāṇas?// So this rascaldom has spoiled the whole Vedic culture. The so-called Westernized scholars... Because the real purpose was that the rulers[?], they did not want to present Indian culture as very old, because then their Darwin's theory will be spoiled. That was their nonsense proposition, that they are proposing that human brain is being developed. But if they accept that millions of years ago the brain was already there, then their rascals theory of Darwin will be spoiled.

So actual fact is this, that this verse //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// was compiled five thousand years ago. Not that Vyāsadeva manufactured something. All Vedic literatures were existing. Vyāsadeva only... Just like I am presenting. I am presenting the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is not it is manufactured by me, it is concocted by me, that I have introduced... Just like so many things are there---this //samāja,// that //samāja,// this //samāja.// We are not like that. As Kṛṣṇa is old, so this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is also old. It is as old as Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says that "Forty millions of years ago I spoke this //Bhagavad-gītā// to sun-god." So where is the history? Where your history stands? Your history cannot give chronological table more than three thousand years.

So Vedic culture is very old. It is not a concocted thing or a new pattern. It is eternal. Therefore it is called //sanātana. Sanātana// means eternal. It has no beginning, no end. //Sanātana.// So Vedic culture means //sanātana,// eternal. Kṛṣṇa is eternal. We living entities, we are eternal. And our relationship and exchange of loving service with Kṛṣṇa is also eternal. Kṛṣṇa is eternal, we are eternal, and our dealings with Kṛṣṇa is also eternal. But sometimes it becomes interrupted by the //māyā,// which is called //svapna. Svapna// means dreamlike. As dream has no fact, it is all hallucination, similarly our detachment from Kṛṣṇa is also a hallucination. Actually, there is no detachment. And when we are covered by this hallucination... Just like in dream we cry, "Oh, here is a tiger! Here is a tiger!" Tiger. Where is tiger? Similarly, this forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa is like that. So if we simply follow the rules and regulations given by the great //ācāryas,// then immediately we can revive our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It doesn't take even second. The method...[?] Just like you are dreaming, crying, "There is tiger, tiger." And if somebody pushes you, "Why you are doing that?" And if you immediately become awake "Oh! All tiger finished." [laughter] "All tiger finished." So one has to give the push that "There is no tiger." Then immediately the whole hallucination will go.

So this pushing method is given by Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally, Kṛṣṇa personally. //Jīv jāgo jīv jāgo gauracānda bole.// Gauracandra, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is asking everyone, "Wake up!" The same dreaming. "Wake up."

> jīv jāgo jīv jāgo gauracānda bole
> kota nidrā jāo māyā-piśācīra kole

"Why you are sleeping on the lap of this //māyā,// illusory energy? Why you are sleeping?" //Jīv jāgo jīv jāgo gauracānda bole.// "Get up."

> bhajibo boliyā ese saṁsāra-bhitare
> bhuliyā rohile tumi avidyāra bhare

When we were in the womb of our mother, the situation was so troublesome that we remembered at that time Kṛṣṇa. "Kṛṣṇa..."Just like when we are in great trouble we sometimes remember God. Similarly, that condition, packed-up condition, when the child's in the belly... You get consciousness back... Death means unconscious for seven months. That's all. That is death. There is no death. Death means I give up this body, enter the womb of another mother's body. And the mother nourishes by the materials..., the intestine joined with the belly. So mother supplies it through the pipe and the child grows. When it is fully grown, then he gets back his consciousness. So at that time it becomes very much troublesome to remain in that packed-up condition. So those who are pious, virtuous, they remember at that time, "O Kṛṣṇa, I am again put into this condition of..."[laughter] Oh, don't laugh. It is very serious subject. Try to understand.

So everyone has passed this condition, but by the influence of //māyā// forgets. //Bhajibo boliyā ese saṁsāra-bhitare.// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, "At that time again I promised: 'This time by coming out of my mother's womb, I shall become a devotee.' " But as soon as he comes out, he becomes forgetful. This is going on. This is going on. There is no science, so-called science, who know, the scientists, who know these are facts, how we are passing through repeatedly unpleasant condition. When, as soon as we get a little light with this body, we forget everything. That is called //māyā.// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said the pushing, the point pushing, //enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro lāgi':// "Now I have brought this."

Just like... You have no experience in your country. In India still there are snake charmers. If one is bitten by a snake he remains unconscious. By //mantra// he can be brought into consciousness, in life. If a man is snakebitten... [aside:] He's sleeping. Why? Don't sleep and you can sleep at the end. Don't in the front. It is disturbing. //Enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro lāgi'.// Lord Caitanya said that "I have brought the medicine." //Māyā nāśibāro lāgi'.// Just like the snake charmers, they chant //mantra.// That is factual. It is not story. One medical practitioner friend of mine, when he was student in Lucknow, he stated that there is a palace building, Satar Manjil. Satar Manjil, in Lucknow. There is some government office. So there were several snakebite cases. Several men were killed by snakebite. So they could understand that there is a venomous snake in this building; at the opportunity he bites. So one snakecharmer was called, and one Muhammadan snakecharmer, he came, and he captured that snake and took it away.

Now these medical students, they do not believe in these //mantras.// They were surprised. They think that snakebite means finished, there is no medicine. So they were very much, because they were students, very much inquisitive. They went to that charmer at his place and wanted to know from him what is the secret, is it a fact that //mantra...// So he said, "All right, I shall show you." So he opened one box, and several hundred snakes immediately came out. And all the students, they became so disturbed. Some were crying, some were this way, that way... [laughter] Yes. And the charmer said, "Don't be worried. So long I am here they will not bite. And don't think that these snakes are without poison teeth." He took some of them and showed that "Here is a poison teeth. Not that the poison teeth has been taken away. The poison teeth is there. But by our //mantra,// we subdue it. He cannot do any harm." So the doctor students, medical students inquired that, "Can we not use this //mantra?//" Said, "No. You cannot." Because it has to be... [end]
