**Prabhupāda:**
So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement... They are trying to go to the nature. Just like there is a propaganda, nature means to become animal. They live like animals, naked. They have sex life on the street. They say it is freedom. But the rascals do not know there is no freedom at all. Where is freedom? So long you are under the grip of material nature, //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]], where is freedom? By nature does not mean that you have got freedom. There is no freedom. We are all conditioned. Simply falsely we are thinking of freedom. It requires little brain. Where is freedom? Nobody wants to die, and where is the freedom not to die? Who has got the freedom? Nobody wants to become old, and where is the freedom? Everyone becomes old. But I have got the desire. Even old man, old woman tries to remain young by cosmetic help, to be good looking, and where is the freedom? By nature he is becoming bad looking. So there is no freedom. It is false idea, freedom. Nobody wants to die; death is sure. [aside:] He's sleeping. Nobody wants to become old; he's becoming old. Nobody wants to take birth... Of course, that is very higher stage. //Jñānī,// they want //mukti;// that is also not possible. Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa says, //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]? To stop death, to stop birth, is not possible unless one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unless one [sic] does not come to the position of loving Kṛṣṇa, there's no question of freedom. That is the nature's law. We have forgotten Kṛṣṇa. Instead of loving Kṛṣṇa, we have habituated, we have developed a consciousness to love dog. Just like in your country they say, "Dog is the best friend." So instead of loving God, they have learned to love dog. But nature ways is that you have to forget loving dog, you have to come to the position to love God. That is nature's way. Therefore there is no freedom. There is no freedom. Just like a citizen becomes criminal. The criminal department, the prison, just to correct him: "Unless you become a good citizen, you'll have to be punished in this prison house." Similarly, our real position is to love God, to love Kṛṣṇa. Unless we are on that platform of loving God, the nature will give us trouble. There is no freedom. We should try to understand it. There's no question of freedom.

So the time is up? No. [break] By initiated process one is elevated to the highest position in this material world. //Brāhmaṇas'// position, in this material world, is the highest position. So this is a training to come to the brahminical stage. Then one has to surpass that brahminical stage also. That is called pure goodness. //Brāhmaṇa// is goodness, but there is chance of being contaminated with passion and ignorance, because it is material world. But when [one] surpasses that brahminical stage and becomes pure Vaiṣṇava, then Kṛṣṇa becomes revealed to him. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's name is Vasudeva. Pure stage of life is called //vāsudeva// stage. Just like Vasudeva was father of Kṛṣṇa. That means when one is situated in the Vāsudeva stage, //śuddha-sattva,// pure goodness, Kṛṣṇa is born. Kṛṣṇa born means Kṛṣṇa becomes visible, revealed. So this initiation process is gradually to raise a devotee to that platform. Go on. [break] There is a list of lowborn human beings. //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. So many. So even they are born in low-graded family, still, they can be elevated to the highest position by purificatory process. The example is given by Sanātana Gosvāmī: just like bell metal, if one can mix with it mercury, it becomes gold. Anyone can try it. Bell metal. Bell metal means mixture of copper and tin. That makes bell metal. Eighty percent copper, eighty percent tin. And along with it, if some suitable percentage of mercury is mixed, it becomes immediately gold. This chemical suggestion is there in the Vedic //śāstras.// So it is clear that they were quite aware of all these chemical method. So the example is given, as the base metal or bell metal can be transferred into gold by mixture of mercury under certain process, //yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti kāṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ... Rasa, rasa// means mercury. //Tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena.// Similarly, any lowborn, it doesn't matter what he is, if proper initiation is conducted, then //tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇām,// he becomes a //brāhmaṇa.// He becomes a //brāhmaṇa. Dvijatvam. Dvija// means twice-born. Any man. In India there are many rascals who think that without being born in a //brāhmaṇa// family nobody can become //brāhmaṇa.// That is not the verdict of //śāstra.// Here is a verse in the //Bhāgavata, kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ ye 'nye ca pāpā// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. Not only all these mentioned, //kirāta-hūṇāndhra... Hūṇa. Hūṇa// class is found still on the northern side of Russia and Germany. When I went to Moscow I have seen, they're so much addicted to meat-eating. They're simply eating meat. In Russia also. They do not eat much fruits or vegetables, or not available. So these... Low class means the more they are addicted to meat-eating. Just like animals. They may be very strong. A tiger is also strong, but what is the use of it? Nobody cares for the tiger. Although tiger is very strong, one is afraid of it, but if you become a tiger what is the use of it? So this material civilization, they are trying to make this body tigerlike strong. They do not know that what is the usefulness of tiger. No use for... At least, for human society they are simply meant for being killed, shooting. So this demonic civilization is simply meant for being shooted by the laws of nature. Therefore you'll find revolution, war, in the western part of the world. They are being shooted by the laws of nature. They are thinking, "If we become tigerlike, our life is successful." But they do not know that if you become tigerlike, demon, you are just become suitable for being shooted. That's all. [laughter] They do not know this.

So it is not the aim of human life, to become a tiger. It is, the aim of human life is to become a devotee of Viṣṇu, Vaiṣṇava. That is perfection of life. So we are, this movement, we are giving the highest benediction to the human society. They are becoming Vaiṣṇava. There is great necessity of Vaiṣṇava at the present moment because everyone has become //śūdras. Kalau śūdra sambhava.// And because it is, everywhere the //śūdras// are there, how there can be peace? They do not know. They have no brain how to make the society peaceful and prosperous. They are //śūdras.// They have no intelligence. There is necessity of creating //brāhmaṇas// and Vaiṣṇava. This movement is meant for that purpose. So be careful. Don't be turned again to //śūdra// and //mlecchas.// Go on making progress to become pure Vaiṣṇava. Then your life is successful and you'll give the best service to the human society. [aside:] You can... But what can be done? Still you have to remain a Vaiṣṇava. And perhaps you know it, the tigers cannot eat daily. Tiger life means almost starvation. You'll find, if you have ever seen a real photograph in forest of a tiger, the belly is... There is no food. They cannot get food. Because they are ferocious, by nature's law, it is not allowed by the..., he'll take food every day. No. After fifteen days, one month, gets a prey and eats the blood. They cannot eat. So tiger life is not very comfortable life. [laughter] You'll have to starve. And if you become Vaiṣṇava, three times you get nice //prasādam.// [laughter] This is practical. You see. [laughter] You see. All these tigers, they are eating in the restaurant. What they are eating? Nonsense. And come here and see what we are eating. Practical. There is no theoretical. Practical, see. And we have no practically doctor's bill. All these tigers, they have to to pay half the income to the doctors in medicine. So many tablets advertised, in your country especially. For this disease, one tablet, for that disease, one tablet. Dozens of tablet he has to take daily. And at the night also, sleeping tablet. [laughter] But our devotees, they get good opportunity, sleeping very nicely without any tablet. Go on. [break] The centers, they should learn how to conduct this priestly work. You have practically seen, and gradually, you should take charge of everything. All right. [end]
