**Prabhupāda:**
...how to make progress in //bhakti-yoga,// or //bīja-nirharaṇam.// I have explained several times, //bīja-nirharaṇam// [[books:sb:7:7:28|[SB 7.7.28]]]. There is //bīja,// the propensity for lording it over the material nature, resources, that is the //bīja// of materialistic life. How to become a very great personality within this material world. The //bhakti-yoga// is just the opposite. Here everyone is trying to become greater than the other. But //bhakti-yoga// is so nice, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu teaches us, //gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. //Dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ,// servant of the servant of the servant of the servant. The more you become servant of the servant, the more you advance. And here in this material, the more you become greater than your friend, then you are [indistinct]. That means more you become implicated. More... Just like the same example, the more you increase your temperature, you are facing death. Certain temperature is required, 98 degrees. But if you simply increase your temperature, "Oh, it is very nice," then at 107 degrees you finish. So this material improvement means meeting death. Let us come to the point. The nationalism is competition, which nation is greater. Now they have manufactured atomic bomb. That means finishing point they have come to.

So //bīja-nirharaṇam.// This propensity we should always remember that "I shall be greater than him, I shall overlord him." Just like my Godbrothers. The propensity is that "Oh, he has become greater than us," they are very envious. Their propensity is to become but they could not, they are therefore envious. This is materialism. There is no spiritual sense here. In the material..., spiritual world, if somebody is greater in service, others, they appreciate, "How great he is, how he has advanced in Kṛṣṇa's service. We could not do it," the Rādhārāṇī's spirit. Why Rādhārāṇī is worshiped by the devotees? His [her] spirit is like that. If anyone, She finds a nice devotee of Kṛṣṇa, She immediately recommends to Kṛṣṇa, "How nice this devotee. He can render better service than Me. Please accept him." This is spiritualism. This is spiritualism. Who can give better service than Rādhārāṇī? She is so great that She is captivating Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa captivates Madana, Cupid. But Rādhārāṇī captivates Kṛṣṇa. How great She is. //Rādhe jaya jaya mādhava-dayite.// We pray always,

> tapta-kāñcana-gaurāṅgi
> rādhe vṛndāvaneśvari
> vṛṣabhānu-sute devi
> praṇamāmi hari-priye

**[I offer my respects to Rādhārāṇī, whose bodily complexion is like molten gold and who is the Queen of Vṛndāvana. You are the daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu, and You are very dear to Lord Kṛṣṇa.]**

The most dear, most beloved by Kṛṣṇa is Rādhārāṇī, and She is so humble. As soon as a humble devotee approaches Rādhārāṇī by glorifying Kṛṣṇa, immediately She accepts, "Oh, how great he is, he is doing greater service than Me." That is //mahā-bhāgavata's darśana. Mahā-bhāgavata// sees that everyone is engaged in service, therefore he has no discrimination. But don't imitate like that. So //bīja-nirharaṇam,// the //bīja// you should always understand. Material //bīja// means the propensity to rule over this material world better or greater than others. That is materialism. And therefore, Kṛṣṇa's first condition is that "You give up all this nonsense, please surrender unto Me." They are [indistinct] Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //bīja-nirharaṇam, bhakti-yoga.// The more one advances in //bhakti-yoga,// he is become humbler, because he has nothing to do with this material world. Suppose a devotee is addressed by ill names. What does he care for it? Or if he is addressed by some good names. What does he care for it? One should be callous to all these so-called good names and bad names, because we do not belong to this material world. If I say that "I am so great, I am this, I am //brāhmaṇa,// I am..." So what shall I do, taking this brahmanism of greatness of this material world? //Bīja-nirharaṇam,// yoga. This //bhakti-yoga// is called killing or importing the seed of ruling over this material world.

So the beginning is //guru-śuśrūṣayā,// we have explained, by service to the spiritual master with love, //bhaktyā,// not officially. Officially doing something and internally doing something, then that will not be successful. Actually with brain and with love and affection, service.

> guru-śuśrūṣayā bhaktyā
> sarva-labdhārpaṇena ca

//Sarva-labdhārpaṇena.// Śrīdhara Swami comments on the //sarva-labdhārpaṇena// means //sarveṣāṁ sādhyanam ātmanena. Sādhya// means respect. Whatever highest respect you have got, that should be offered to the spiritual master. //Sarva-sādhya-paṇena[?].// Then //tat-pādāmburuha..., tat-pādāmburuha-dhyānāt..., tat-pādāmburuha-dhyānāt tat liṅga ārhaṇa ādi. Īkṣa ārhaṇa ādi.// So the //linga. Linga// means the form, the Deity. //Tat-pādāmburuha-dhyānāt.// Always meditating upon the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma... As soon as we hear this sound, immediately we remember the form of Kṛṣṇa. Immediately we concentrate on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This chanting is perfect. But I am chanting and I am thinking of and planning something else, that is //aparādha.// But that does not mean we shall stop. But we should try, //abhyāsa-yoga,// we should try to make it our habit by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// we should immediately remember the form, quality, pastimes of Kṛṣṇa. //Tat-pādāmburuha-dhyānāt.// The lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, //dhyānāt,// that is meditation. //Tat-pādāmburuha-dhyānāt tal-liṅgekṣārhaṇādibhiḥ.// To come to the temple, Deity worship is meant for that purpose, just to see the form of Kṛṣṇa so that we may remember. Always, 24 hours we can see. It is not idol worship. The rascal atheists, they can say like that, but our process is this. //Guru-sevā,// offering all respect to guru, and always thinking of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, seeing His forms in the temple, worshiping Him as they are described, as they are prescribed in the //śāstras,// this is the process. //Tal-liṅgekṣārhaṇādibhiḥ. Tasya liṅgānām mūrtinām īkṣaṇa, īkṣaṇam ca arhaṇam ca ādi yeṣām bandhanādinam tasya//[?].

So this is one of the process that not only one should serve the spiritual master with faith and love, but he should always think of Kṛṣṇa. The Māyāvādī philosophy is..., they say that "You think of the spiritual master, he is God." That is Māyāvādī. Just like we have been in Surat, there is some Rāma Mandir without Rāma. This is rascaldom. They have placed their photo of spiritual master but no Deity. This is Māyāvādī. Ours is not like that. Ours is side by side. Not only spiritual master, his spiritual master, his spiritual master, along with the Deity. //Tat liṅgam,// we are calling[?] the form. So //tasya liṅgānām mūrtinām. Liṅga// means //mūrti.// The //liṅga// is sometimes... Some //liṅga// is also... Just like //śrī-liṅga, pūr-liṅga,// the feminine gender, masculine gender. So here //liṅga// also means the //mūrti,// the form. //Liṅga// means whether he is a //puruṣa,// or he is a woman or man, or his form. //Liṅgānām mūrtinām. Mūrtinam īkṣaṇa. Īkṣaṇa// means seeing. Therefore, the Deities should be very nicely decorated, the temple should be very much cleansed, all-attractive. People may come and immediately become attracted by the Deities, //īkṣaṇam,// with devotion. That is the system of temple worship. Unclean temple worship or no decoration, no flower, this is useless. If you want to introduce temple worship, that should be properly done so that any man who comes immediately become attracted with the form, //īkṣaṇam.// That facility should be given to the ordinary man. If he comes and he hears the chanting, the //kīrtana,// the bell sound, the //karatāla// sound, in this way gradually he becomes attracted. As we have seen, many students come in this way. They live and they become devotee. So these chances should be given. These chances should be given, according to //śāstra,// according to Prahlāda Mahārāja's instruction. //Tat liṅga īkṣa arhaṇa-ādibhiḥ.//

> hariḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> bhagavān āsta īśvaraḥ
> iti bhūtāni manasā
> kāmais taiḥ sādhu mānayet
> [[books:sb:7:6:32|[SB 7.6.32]]]

Another thing is //harīḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu bhagavān ananta īśvaraḥ.// So we should practice to see every man as the temple, every man, every living entity, because Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Antaryāmī or Paramātmā is residing with every living entity. So in higher status, a devotee sees everybody as temple of God, because the God is there. So this should be also practiced. As we respect a temple or a church, similarly, we should give respect to all living entities. //Harīḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu bhagavān ananta īśvaraḥ. Bhagavān ananta.// If some foolish person says how God can be in every..., within everybody? No, He is //ananta,// He is unlimited, He can be, that is His omnipotency. //Bhagavān ananta īśvaraḥ, iti bhūtāni manasā kāmais taiḥ sādhu mānayet.// In this way, we should offer respect to everyone. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also says, //amāninā mānadena,// give respect to everyone and for yourself don't expect any respect. One may insult you, don't mind, but you give respect to others. Just see how //bhakti-yoga// is perfect.

//Evaṁ nirjita-ṣaḍ-vargaiḥ kriyate bhaktir īśvare.// This practice will gradually enhance your devotion, at the same time your strong senses eager to enjoy this material world will be cut down. That is called breaking the poison teeth of the serpents, sense serpents. //Durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta-daṁṣṭrāyate.// For a devotee there is no danger from the senses because his senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. So he is the greatest yogi. Yogi means who are trying to control the senses. That is by practice, by mechanical practice, that's all. But here there is no mechanical practice. Here it is factual activity, how to control the senses. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Hṛṣīka// means the senses. The senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. If one thing is already engaged, it cannot be..., especially when one is engaged in the service of the Lord, he cannot be dragged to the service of //māyā.// Therefore, that is sense control. Sense you cannot extinguish. The living entity, you must have your senses. Living means you have got your senses. But they should be purified. They are now engaged in the service of //māyā,// and now, by //bhakti-yoga// process you have to purify and engage the senses in the service of the Lord. The eyes and hands, the legs, the tongue, the ear, all the senses. The eyes, instead of seeing very beautiful woman, see Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī. That sense perception is there, but it is spiritualized. The tongue wants go to restaurant and eat meat and drink wine, but engage the tongue in eating //prasādam,// that is control, that's all. Controlling, not that stop, lock up the tongue. Everything, every sense. Sex life. All right, if you can beget child to take care to raise him a Kṛṣṇa conscious, all right, have children. This is our sense control. Not artificially stopping them. No question of stopping. But utilize it for Kṛṣṇa's service, that is //bhakti.// That is //bīja-nirharaṇam.// You will never like to control over. Being controlled by the Supreme Lord, you will feel so much satisfaction that you will never like to control over, that is materialism.

> kriyate bhaktir īśvare
> vāsudeve bhagavati
> yayā saṁlabhyate ratiḥ
> [[books:sb:7:6:33|[SB 7.6.33]]]

In this way, when he is fully engaged in the service of Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, at that time he is fully satisfied, he is no more disturbed.

> protkaṇṭha udgāyati rauti nṛtyati
> [[books:sb:7:6:34|[SB 7.6.34]]]

In this way, as he makes advance in spiritual life, then simply by //niśamya karmāṇi guṇān atulyān,// simply by hearing about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, immediately he will be filled up in ecstasy and he will cry. These are the symptoms. //Niśamya karmāṇi guṇān atulyān, vīryāṇi līlā-tanubhiḥ kṛtāni. Vīryān līlā,// Kṛṣṇa is killing so many demons, Kṛṣṇa is dancing with //gopīs,// Kṛṣṇa is playing with His cowherd boys, Kṛṣṇa is going there, this is //līlā, smaraṇam.// The //Kṛṣṇa// book reading means remembering all these activities of Kṛṣṇa. Simply go on reading //Kṛṣṇa// book, repeat it, you are in the perfect stage of transcendental position. Simply read our Nectar of Devotion. //Līlā, atulyān. Niśamya karmāṇi guṇān atulyān, vīryāṇi līlā-tanubhiḥ kṛtāni, yadātiharṣotpulakāśru-gadgadam. Pulakasru,// in ecstasy. //Pulaka// is trembling and faltering voice and tears coming down, perspiring, these are [called] //aṣṭa-sāttvika-vikāra// [[books:cc:antya:14:99|[Cc. Antya 14.99]]]. //Protkaṇṭha udgāyati rauti nṛtyati.//

//Nirjita sāmyam kāma krodha lobha moha mada mātsa jana indriyāṇi nirvā varga jay bhagavat rathe liṅga saha//[?]. The symptoms of advancement, these are stated here. [end]
