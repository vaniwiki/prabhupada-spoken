**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the taste of the water." So everyone has got, everyone has knowledge what is the taste of water. Why do you say he does not know Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the light of the sunshine." So who has not seen the sunshine? So when you see sunshine, if you think, "It is Kṛṣṇa," what is the difficulty? There is no difficulty. //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi sūryayoḥ// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. There is no difficulty. //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi sūryayoḥ.// When you see some moonlight...

**Reporter:**
It's very, I think, sir, that we must, as you say, live and have our being in Kṛṣṇa...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is already, but you have forgot.

**Reporter:**
It is unique. It is so unique. Of course, I mean to say...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Why it is not easy?

**Reporter:**
It is not easy to be able to live, everybody... You know what a //pāpī// I am. I don't think the Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so easy...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no. Even if you are //pāpī,// if you see... Don't you see the sunlight?

**Reporter:**
It's very easy to see.

**Prabhupāda:**
Suppose you are //pāpī.// Do you think that you don't see the sunlight?

**Reporter:**
Yes, we do.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if Kṛṣṇa says, "The sunlight is Myself," what is the difficulty, even if you are //pāpī?// If..., don't... If you say, "I won't understand like that," that is another thing. But if the statement is clear, even if you are //pāpī,// what is the difficulty to understand? Simply if you say, "I won't understand," like this, that is a different thing.

**Reporter:**
No, no, no. So how do you explain to a Muslim, he's...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no. You say one after another.

**Reporter:**
Yes, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't make me distressed. So try to understand.

**Reporter:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have raised that "I cannot understand." What is the difficulty to understand?

**Reporter:**
I mean to be able to actually live it, day to day, like.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is a question of... Even suppose Kṛṣṇa says, "This beautiful flower I am." So you are seeing this beautiful flower. So why do you not understand if Kṛṣṇa says like that? This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa says, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ buddhiḥ manaḥ eva ca bhinnā me prakṛtiḥ aṣṭadhā:// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]] "These eight [indistinct], eight kinds of material elements, they are My energy." So you are sitting on the ground, //bhūmiḥ,// so if you understand that it is one of the energy of Kṛṣṇa.... Just like the electric fan is running on, everyone knows there is electric energy. Similarly, if you see the ground, //bhūmiḥ,// as expansion of Kṛṣṇa's energy, what is the difficulty? //Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vayuḥ.//

**Reporter:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Reporter:**
It is very easy to... Sir, what is difficult to...

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know what is the difficulty. [Hindi]

**Reporter:**
[Hindi] [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is very simple, you see. Actually one who does not understand what is Kṛṣṇa, for the neophyte, the prescription is there, that "You understand Kṛṣṇa like this." Because you are dealing with //bhūmiḥ,// you are dealing with water, you are dealing

with fire, you are dealing with air, you are dealing with sky, you are dealing with mind, you are dealing with intelligence. You are dealing with all these things. Well, Kṛṣṇa says, "They are display of My energy." And then again says //apareyam:// "These energies are inferior," //itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām,// "and there is another energy superior." What is that? //Jīva-bhūta,// the living entity, //mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]. So what is the difficulty? I do not understand. He is explaining everything in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Simply we have to take it as it is. Kṛṣṇa says that "I am this," and if you say, "No, Kṛṣṇa is not like this," so that is your nonsense. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am this." If you want to understand, just like if you want to understand me, I say that "I am a //sannyāsī,// I am a preacher," and if you say, "No, you are not a preacher," then how you can understand? I am giving my identification that "I am this." So you have to understand. You are writing also, understanding like that. So why do you deny it when Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the origin. This is My energy"? What is the reason you deny it? What is the reason?

**Reporter:**
Sir, nobody is denying. Only we are trying to comprehend, understand.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there is no question of comprehension. When you see a snake, call it a snake. There is no question of comprehension. This is a fan, everyone knows. When I will say, "This is a fan," everyone understands it. Law of identification. Kṛṣṇa is identifying Himself, that "This is my energy."

**Reporter:**
Let us understand you first of all.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have no personal presentation. I am speaking only what Kṛṣṇa... Therefore we are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.// Here is the book, you see. This book, //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,// which we are presenting, and publisher is Macmillan Company, and every year they are printing at least fifty thousand copies. This is for our fifth edition. They are printing this book since 1968. '68, '69, '70, '71, that, I think, I know they have, they are fifth edition, and people are reading it, //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.// Our..., we don't change. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the Supreme," and we are saying Kṛṣṇa is the same, Supreme. Even I do not understand what is Kṛṣṇa, I am simply presenting what is written in the //Bhagavad-gītā. mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya:// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]] "There is no superior element above Me." So we say, "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. There is no other Supreme." Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. We say that "You follow, think of Kṛṣṇa, you become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, you offer your respect to Kṛṣṇa." So we are not [indistinct], because we are presenting Kṛṣṇa as He is speaking in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that's all.

**Reporter:**
How do you feel the modern world...

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the feeling. You see the effect.

**Reporter:**
What's your feeling?

**Prabhupāda:**
My feeling, I am very satisfied that Kṛṣṇa is accepted by presenting as He is. I must be very satisfied, because before me, who did not present Kṛṣṇa as He is, there was not a single Kṛṣṇa conscious person in the Western world. Now I have got thousands. So why I shall not feel satisfied? Those who misinterpreted //Bhagavad-gītā//---"This is this, this is that, this is that"---they could not get even one Kṛṣṇa conscious person, and by presenting //Bhagavad-gītā,// they are selling fifty thousand copies per month, and I am getting every year one thousand, two thousand Kṛṣṇa devotees. So why it is not practical?

**Reporter:**
In India?

**Prabhupāda:**
In India everyone is Kṛṣṇa conscious. They are trying to forget Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Reporter:**
Oh, we are. I see.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone Kṛṣṇa conscious. Who does not know Kṛṣṇa?

**Reporter:**
That's right, sir, that is we are very poor specimens. I mean every...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. By force you are trying to forget Kṛṣṇa, that's all.

**Reporter:**
Sir, I beg your pardon, sir. We are very poor specimens.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Reporter:**
If, as you said, sir, we are all, everybody is Kṛṣṇa conscious in India, still I can say we are to [indistinct] problems here. We are very poor specimens. I won't talk in all other...

**Prabhupāda:**
But you do... Don't you... You have not heard Kṛṣṇa's name?

**Reporter:**
We have heard...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. You have not heard Kṛṣṇa's name? Then why you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious?

**Reporter:**
We are conscious of the Kṛṣṇa's existence.

**Prabhupāda:**
Outside..., out of India they ask us this question, that "In India, how many Kṛṣṇa conscious?" Every Indian is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Every Indian is Kṛṣṇa conscious. But he's trying to forget by artificial means.

**Reporter:**
So you mean by Kṛṣṇa conscious...

**Prabhupāda:**
By nature every Indian born is Kṛṣṇa conscious, but at the present moment they are trying to forget Him. That is the problem, going on.

**Reporter:**
What part of Kṛṣṇa? Or just part of His life?

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa, there is no part. Kṛṣṇa is absolute.

**Reporter:**
He doesn't have form. For me, and for my child, Kṛṣṇa's here child life is very better.

**Prabhupāda:**
For child, and for me or for you, simply try to understand that there is a person Kṛṣṇa. That's all.

**Reporter:**
So, sir, are we rightly understanding that by "Kṛṣṇa" you mean some eternal principle, not as...

**Prabhupāda:**
Not principle. A person, like you, like me.

**Reporter:**
A person?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Just so you are talking with me, I am talking with you, you are person, I am person, similarly Kṛṣṇa is a person.

**Reporter:**
Person in the ordinary sense of the word, or...?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. He is Supreme Person.

**Reporter:**
Supreme?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Just like we are sitting here in Delhi City. Now here is Lalaji. He is supreme personality, mayor. [laughter]

**Reporter:**
So we, we can see and feel and touch Him and be something also like...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. I am taking for example India, the president is the supreme personality. The president is the supreme personality. You have to admit it. You may accept him or not, but officially you have to admit. So in this whole creation, cosmic manifestation, there must be some Supreme Personality. That is Kṛṣṇa. That is confirmed by Kṛṣṇa and the //Bhagavad-gītā, mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid as ti dhanañjaya:// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]] "There is no superior personality than Me." And we accept it. There is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness: "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person." So our knowledge is very easy. We don't make any research. Here is Kṛṣṇa says that He is the Supreme Personality---we accept it. That's all. It is very simple.

**Reporter:**
Can we see Him, just as we see Lalaji?

**Prabhupāda:**
And why not? Why not?

**Reporter:**
But with these eyes or the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, with these eyes. Simply you have to purify. Just like Lalaji, now he is known here. We can see. But he goes in the streets, nobody knows him. So you mis..., might have seen Lalaji; he cannot see. Is it not? Tell me this? One who does not know Lalaji, Lalaji on the street, then even Lalaji meets him he does not see him. Why?

**Reporter:**
Question of eyes and knowing, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Then he has to make prepare his eyes to see Lalaji.

**Reporter:**
So, sir, how do we prepare eyes to see?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is, that is the question.

**Reporter:**
[indistinct] [laughter] He said it's easy. I said, well, I know what is...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. It is easy. It is easy. Suppose I say, you say that "I have never seen Lalaji," and if I say, "Here is Lalaji. Why don't you see?" and if he accepts, that is... That's all right. What is the difficulty? If you say, "No, I cannot believe you. I don't think that he is Lalaji. Lalaji, why he is walking on the street? He must be in a big, nice car." But if you put all this argument, then it is very difficult for you. But if you believe me that "Here is Lalaji," then the matter is very simple.

**Reporter:**
The question is faith versus the...

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not faith. It is not Lala... When I speak "Here is Lalaji," it is not faith. It is fact.

**Reporter:**
I guess because you have...

**Prabhupāda:**
But you don't believe me.

**Reporter:**
Because you have personally witnessed, you see, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. It is not faith.

**Reporter:**
Oh, yes, sir. You are [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
If you believe me, then it is all right. If you don't believe me, that is different.

**Reporter:**
Then, sir, if everybody [indistinct] and that comment, "Believe me," that...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Why do I say...? You have to, you have to see whether, whether this person is worthy of believing. [laughter]

**Reporter:**
Whether the //guru// is right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Therefore //guru, guru// cannot be any ordinary man.

**Reporter:**
That's right.

**Prabhupāda:**
That //guru// cannot be. That //guru's// designation is there in the //Vedas,// that //tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. Anyone who is inquisitive for understanding... Suppose if you are inquisitive to understand really what is Lalaji, then you must approach to a person who knows Lalaji. Then you will understand Lalaji. And if you approach somebody who does not know Lalaji, then he may give you misinformation. So //guru// is that who knows Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise you will not be able to understand what is Kṛṣṇa. That Kṛṣṇa also very easily you can find out. Take what Kṛṣṇa says. Kṛṣṇa teaches //Bhagavad-gītā// to Arjuna directly. Now if you believe Arjuna, then you understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa taught //Bhagavad-gītā// to Arjuna, and why Arjuna was taught, that is also said by Kṛṣṇa, that //bhakto 'si priyo 'si:// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]] "Because you are My devotee." Kṛṣṇa did not go to teach //Bhagavad-gītā// to a Vedantist. He went to teach to Arjuna. He was a family man, he was a soldier, but why he was selected? He, Kṛṣṇa said, //bhakto 'si.// So if you approach a Kṛṣṇa //bhakta// like Arjuna, then you will understand Kṛṣṇa; otherwise you will not. They are understanding Kṛṣṇa through me, not before me. But if they or some of them, "something," some of them "something," they may be very big scholar, but they did not know what is Kṛṣṇa.

**Reporter:**
So first there should be direct...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Reporter:**
...apprehension by...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. One must be //brahma-niṣṭham, śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham. Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. //Abhigacchet// means //must.// You //must// find out a //guru// who knows Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise there is no possibility of knowing Kṛṣṇa.

**Reporter:**
So, sir, for we poor mortals it is very difficult to immediately, you see, to...

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not a subject matter to understand immediately.

**Reporter:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not subject matter to understand immediately. It is a science.

**Reporter:**
Yes, a science.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is a science, //jñāna sa vijñāna.// So you cannot understand a science in five minutes. That is not possible.

**Reporter:**
Yes. So we were trying to understand... No. We have just come to understand you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That was others you cannot understand. [laughter]

**Reporter:**
[indistinct] He is trying to tell some kind of parochial [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
If you kindly accept what I say, then it is possible. If you are simply, what I say, if you have faith in me, and if what I say you believe, then you can understand. Other, it is not possible.

**Reporter:**
Can there be an existence without a faith, sir?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Faith is the beginning. But you have to... If you don't increase that faith scientifically, then that faith will not help you.

**Reporter:**
My [indistinct], sir, that without existence, without faith, there can not be [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. That I say: faith is the beginning. Faith is the beginning.

**Reporter:**
Because I take the word of my father, of my mother, that he is my father...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Reporter:**
...I cannot prove it. Nobody can prove it that he is my father.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. Therefore that is the beginning of knowledge. That is the beginning, //adau śraddhā.// That is stated in the //śāstra: adau śraddhā,// faith. Then if you have got //śraddhā,// then //ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]. Suppose if you are, if you are very much anxious, you have got faith to understand Kṛṣṇa, then next step is to associate with persons who know Kṛṣṇa. Just like you are doing some business, so you have to enter into some association, businessmen, to understand the business from them. Similarly, if you have faith in Kṛṣṇa, then you have to understand Him through the association of devotees. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgau// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]. //Atha bhajana-kriyā.// Then as soon as you have... Just as these boys, they came to me. After association they wanted to be initiated: "Swami, please initiate." That is called //bhajana-kriyā. Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ atha bhajana kriyā.// And if you are performing //bhajana kriyā// nicely, then //anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt,// then all misgivings will go away.

**Reporter:**
//Anartha visya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.// Then nobody will question. All questions will be //anartha-nivṛttiḥ,// all doubts gone. Then //niṣṭhā,// firm faith. Then firm faith, //niṣṭhā.// Then taste. Whenever there is Kṛṣṇa topics, immediately you go. //Tato niṣṭhā...//

**Reporter:**
Taste?

**Prabhupāda:**
Taste, //ruciḥ.//

**Reporter:**
//Accha.// Taste, //ruciḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tato niṣṭhā tataḥ ruciḥ athāsakti ,// then attachment.

**Reporter:**
//Tathā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Āsakti.//

**Reporter:**
//Āsakti.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// That is Kṛṣṇa says, //mayi āsakta.// We have to increase our //āsakta,// attachment, for Kṛṣṇa by this process. //Tathāsakti tataḥ bhāvaḥ.// Then you will see Kṛṣṇa everywhere. That is //kṛṣṇa prema.//

**Reporter:**
That is //bhāva.// That is at last...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, not last. Last but one. The last stage is you can not live without Kṛṣṇa.

**Reporter:**
What do you call in Sanskrit, sir?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is called, first of all //bhāvaḥ,// then //prema, prema, kṛṣṇa prema.// That is our high perfection. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu is speaking that "I am seeing everything vacant without Kṛṣṇa." //Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.// That is the last stage of perfection. You become mad about, after Kṛṣṇa. So that will take time. This is the process. But faith is the beginning. Yes. And that faith is also explained by the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta: śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya.// Faith means such faith that firm faith, //sudṛḍha, niścaya,// certain. //Kṛṣṇa bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya.// This is faith. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. So faith means to believe in the word of Kṛṣṇa, that "Surrendering to Kṛṣṇa I will get everything. Now, I am free. This is my perfection." That is called faith. Kṛṣṇa said that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Now, if I say unto you that "You give up everything, come with me," unless you have got firm faith, how can you do it? That is faith. That faith has to be increased, and then it will reach to the stage of love.

**Reporter:**
Sir, just now we are coming from the press conference of another saint, Bala Yogesvara. He said, his slogan is, "Give me love, I'll give you peace."

**Prabhupāda:**
What?

**Reporter:**
He wants immediate this thing. Yours, in your case, //prema// comes last. He says, "Give me love, I give you peace." //Śānti-prema go śānti lo.// [sound of siren] [discussion on siren sound]

**Prabhupāda:**
I think blackout is over. [more discussion on blackout]

**Devotee:**
Shut the shutters on the doors and we'll go right [indistinct].

**Reporter:**
Sir, this is the real present ugly reality here. We are being threatened.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Reporter:**
This siren is a, shall I say, a very ugly reality before us.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are already in ugly reality always, twenty-four hours. [laughter] Suppose there is no blackout. Still, if you go in the street, is there guarantee that you will go home?

**Reporter:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is that guarantee?

**Reporter:**
No, no.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you are always in ugly reality. Why do you say this blackout? This is one of the features of that ugly reality. That's all.

**Reporter:**
Yes. At the moment I see, but has it...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? [laughs] You are all, you do not realize that, that you are twenty-four hours in ugly reality! [break] ...attended. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām// [SB 10.14.58]. Every step danger. Why taking this?

**Reporter:**
I know, sir, but this is collective, national danger here. Have you anything to offer to us as a, as a...

**Prabhupāda:**
This Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Our only remedy is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You take to this and you will be happy. That's all.

**Reporter:**
We'll..., yes, sir. I think somebody should go to [indistinct], to those who are threatening us. Some, I wish...

**Prabhupāda:**
What benefit you will derive by going to [indistinct]?

**Reporter:**
But, well, he'll go to the... Supposing somebody is out to kill me. That's changing, if you can't tell him...

**Prabhupāda:**
But suppose [indistinct] does not kill you. Will you be safe?

**Reporter:**
No, sir. That I can see, but...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then what is the use of going to [indistinct]? You will die today or tomorrow. That's all. If you want to save yourself, then go to Kṛṣṇa. That is our proposal. [laughter] As soon as you go the [indistinct], he does not fight, do you mean to say you will live forever?

**Reporter:**
No, no, sir. I've got...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then what is the use of telling [indistinct]? Trust Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa so that you may perpetually be saved. Why don't you take that?

**Reporter:**
I was only thinking in terms of collective security, not... I can see your point now.

**Prabhupāda:**
You should know that you are always in danger.

**Reporter:**
Yes, sir. We agree.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Reporter:**
The great Einstein said the same thing when he was actually... He said there was no question...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is our position.

**Reporter:**
I could many times fall from here...

**Prabhupāda:**
And Kṛṣṇa says, "I will save you." Therefore let us go to Kṛṣṇa. Why [indistinct]?

**Reporter:**
Changing, because he is disturbing, that's all.

**Prabhupāda:**
Disturbing... Your mind is also disturbing always.

**Reporter:**
Yes, yes. You are...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is always with you. Your body disease always with you. Are you not suffering from bodily pains---"Oh, I'll [indistinct]"? Why don't you go to [indistinct] to cure your [indistinct]? [laughter]. So why you do? You are already in danger. If you... Why don't you realize that point?

**Reporter:**
That I... Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore...

**Reporter:**
But we are talking of national problems.

**Prabhupāda:**
These are symptoms. Just like one man is diseased and he is saying, "Oh, [indistinct]." Real thing is his disease. These are symptoms. So people are trying to cure patchwork. We are giving the supreme cure. That is the difference. No patchwork, no patchwork disease cure will help you. Complete cure.

> janma karma [ca] me divyam
> [evaṁ] yo janati tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti mām eti
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

**Reporter:**
//Mām eti.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. That we want. No more repetition of birth and death. //Mām eti.// That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. If you go to Kṛṣṇa, then you don't come back again.

**Reporter:**
Sir, I..., mine was a very hypothetical question. Supposing hundred pure saintly Kṛṣṇa conscious people are meditating or discussing or just serving together, and there comes somebody, some //duṣṭa[?]// who drops a bomb, and at the end of all...

**Prabhupāda:**
So those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious, he has not afraid of bomb. They are not afraid of bomb.

**Reporter:**
How to [indistinct] such people? We are such, sir, we are...

**Prabhupāda:**
Now they receive bomb, then it is Kṛṣṇa's desire that bomb has come.

**Reporter:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [laughter]

**Reporter:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is never afraid of anything. //Bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād.// One who has conception of anything other than Kṛṣṇa, he is afraid. One who knows everything is Kṛṣṇa, why he should be afraid? If bomb is coming, he will see, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is coming." Yes. That is the vision of the devotee. So he thinks, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa wants to kill me as bomb. Oh, that's all right. I will be killed." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Reporter:**
We do not fight?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Reporter:**
We do not fight?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he will fight. He will fight. By the direction of Kṛṣṇa.

**Reporter:**
By God inside?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He is not..., he is not afraid of fighting, but he will fight under direction of Kṛṣṇa.

**Reporter:**
On that, sir, he has put the real question which I was fumbling to ask. So...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Kṛṣṇa fought. Kṛṣṇa...

**Reporter:**
In the Kṛṣṇa conscious scheme there is also active struggle and activity?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Certainly. //Niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ.// Instead of sitting idle, if you act badly, that is good.

**Reporter:**
Ah. There you are, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Kṛṣṇa's advice. Kṛṣṇa does not say sit idly. Neither Arjuna was advised like that. Neither... Arjuna wanted to be nonviolent, sit idly. Kṛṣṇa never did so. Kṛṣṇa said, "Oh, you fight. You are //kṣatriya.// It is your duty." And in order to raise him to that fighting position, this position, He taught him //Bhagavad-gītā.// So don't think that Kṛṣṇa //bhaktas// are idle, sitting only. No. That is mistaken idea. //Kṛṣṇa bhakta// can do anything under the direction of Kṛṣṇa.

**Reporter:**
You are not escapists?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Reporter:**
Maharaja, please go on here helping us. You know, we are [indistinct]. [laughter] [Hindi] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...me that "Your Vaiṣṇavism has killed India." And why? "No, Vaiṣṇava means inactive. They say simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and do nothing." Then "You have not seen a Vaiṣṇava," I told him.

**Reporter:**
Pardon?

**Prabhupāda:**
I told him that he has not seen a Vaiṣṇava.

**Reporter:**
Vaiṣṇava.

**Prabhupāda:**
In India there are two major war, //Rāma-rājya yudha// and //kurukṣetra yudha,// and there the hero is a Vaiṣṇava-Arjuna and Hanumān.

**Reporter:**
Hanumān?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hanumānjī. //Rāma-rājya.//

**Reporter:**
He was perfect Vaiṣṇava.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I told him that "You haven't..., you have, have not seen a Vaiṣṇava."

**Reporter:**
Your permission, may I ask one question? Do we offer any solution for socio-economic problems that you can...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Provided you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, everything will be solved.

**Reporter:**
Will it come by itself, or will it come through you?

**Prabhupāda:**
Immediately. Immediately.

**Reporter:**
How, sir?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? That you have to take it.

**Reporter:**
The condition is to follow the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like Kṛṣṇa says, //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ:// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]] "These four //varṇas//---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra//---it is created by Me." But you are trying to kill it. Why? If you try to kill Kṛṣṇa's program, then how you will be happy?

**Reporter:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? There is no question of preference. Kṛṣṇa's creation, it is there. You are creating [indistinct] caste, //jana-saṅgaś// caste. Caste is already given, in a different name. How you can make casteless? That is not possible. The whole world---"I am American," "I am Indian"---this is caste, bigger caste. //Yasyātma-buddhi-kuṇa.// So long you will be under the concept of this body, there must be caste division. So we have to come to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then there will be no caste. Just like these boys, Americans, Europeans, Africans, Canadians, they have no caste, they have no nationality. They are simply for Kṛṣṇa. That is casteless.

**Reporter:**
So are they //brāhmaṇas?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Reporter:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Kṛṣṇa conscious means //brāhmaṇa. Brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.//

**Reporter:**
Not by birth?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not by birth. They are //brāhmaṇas// by quality. They have got sacred thread. That is also there in the //śāstra. Yasya hi yad lakṣaṇaṁ syat. Varṇa// has been given. //Varṇa. Varṇa,// we want to compare symptoms. The //brāhmaṇas// are this: //satya, samaḥ, damaḥ, titikṣa, ārjavam, jñānam vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. This is the symptom of //brāhmaṇa.// That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// If you find these symptoms anywhere, he is a //brāhmaṇa.//

**Reporter:**
Except those who believe in //Bhagavad-gītā,// not [indistinct], sir. They don't believe in that. They believe caste by birth.

**Prabhupāda:**
He does not know what is //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Reporter:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
I say he does not know what is //Bhagavad-gītā.// If he believes in that way, that he does not know about //Gītā.//

**Reporter:**
He says he's Hindu.

**Prabhupāda:**
Maybe your Hinduism. You lick up your Hinduism. But we are creating real //brāhmaṇa// all over the world.

**Reporter:**
I can see. What Lord Kṛṣṇa has stated, sir, that "I have created these four castes of //āśrama...//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Reporter:**
And I as myself, just, as not somebody told me, just my...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. Not by birth. Kṛṣṇa never says...

**Reporter:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. These four castes... Not caste. We say caste, but //varṇāśrama varṇa. Varṇa.// Anyway, it is division. That division, //vibhāga,// the exact word is "division," not "caste." How you can say caste, it is not there, difference? Division, these four divisions are there. So these divisions are not made by birth. Just like if you are a lawyer. So in the society there are lawyers, engineers, medical men, they are divisions. But these lawyers, medical men or engineers, they are not born as engineer or as lawyer. That is mistake. Anyone who is qualified by the real knowledge, he is a lawyer. Not by birth. Suppose a lawyer's son, a big, big lawyer's son, does it mean that he's lawyer?

**Reporter:**
No. But this is what we have been [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
So you have been something mistake. That should not be accepted.

**Reporter:**
Well, sir, you should know the problem all that there is a...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that problem?

**Reporter:**
All the [indistinct], //harijanas// will [indistinct] you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Reporter:**
If you proclaim that this is the real Hinduism, the people are getting fed up with Hinduism.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. No Hindu. Why you are bringing Hinduism?

**Reporter:**
Our, this system...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Reporter:**
...is only by Hindu...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Hinduism is a foreign word, given by the Muslim. We don't find any word "Hindu" in the Vedic literature. Why do you call Hinduism? We are not preaching Hinduism. We are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Reporter:**
By such a social system, social...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is, that you satisfy [indistinct]. But this is a broad Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is broader than any system, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are not preaching. We don't go to preach that "Oh, we are preaching Hinduism." But because those who are accepting this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, mostly they are Hindus, then you can call it like Hinduism. But this is not Hinduism.

**Reporter:**
Sir, we are in illusion.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is an illusory...

**Reporter:**
Not illusory. I don't know how far Lalaji will go with you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Lalaji is already with me! [laughter]

**Reporter:**
[laughter] [reporter makes jokes] [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Give them //prasāda.//

**Reporter:**
Sir, would you like to give any message to the Indian people?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You take... My message is you take //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is seriously, you will be happy.

**Reporter:**
That's all? Take it as is?

**Prabhupāda:**
Take it AS IT IS. Don't try to interpret foolishly. That is my message.

**Reporter:**
But, sir...

**Prabhupāda:**
So long they are simply foolishly interpreting, therefore they did not get any benefit. But if you take AS IT IS you'll get the benefit.

**Reporter:**
But sir, what are we to do with the [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I say I don't [indistinct] name.

**Reporter:**
Who will name it? Who will [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no question of //bhāṣya.// I say take it AS IT IS. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the Supreme." //Gītā// gave. Why //bhāṣya?// Why //bhāṣya?// They, Kṛṣṇa, in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]. //Kurukṣetre// is still there, you know. There is a station. Why do you interpret in different way?

**Reporter:**
Sir, it is a joy to be with you.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the use of interpreting Kurukṣetra as different? That is a simple waste of time.

**Reporter:**
Are you a skeptic, sir?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Reporter:**
Have you been to Russia [indistinct] and [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Reporter:**
They allowed you to preach?

**Prabhupāda:**
So why not? We are not afraid of anybody.

**Reporter:**
Because they have their own [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
They may have, but the public is not their own. Public is different.

**Reporter:**
That's all right. But you've got to get a visa. How do you... How can you get?

**Prabhupāda:**
Then one Russian professor invited me already.

**Reporter:**
Ah. And to receive visa. Did you give some...

**Prabhupāda:**
Professor Kotovsky.

**Reporter:**
Kotovsky?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You know his name?

**Reporter:**
Well, I have heard of him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He, not invited me officially, but he, we had correspondence. He said, "Swamiji, you come this side, I shall be very glad to meet you."

**Reporter:**
So you went there?

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore, therefore I got the visa.

**Reporter:**
When was this?

**Reporter:**
Twentieth of June.

**Prabhupāda:**
Twentieth.

**Reporter:**
Twentieth.

**Reporter:**
Only this year?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Reporter:**
How long were you there?

**Prabhupāda:**
Only one week.

**Reporter:**
One week. With your disciple?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I have created some disciple.

**Reporter:**
Were you always in Moscow?

**Prabhupāda:**
Moscow, mostly.

**Reporter:**
I see. You..., what did, do they allow some lectures or...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. I had meeting with Professor Kotovsky. That's all.

**Reporter:**
Only?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Reporter:**
Kotovsky only. That's all. He couldn't bring some people? Just his...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He had his assistants, I had my assistants.

**Reporter:**
...and some other people who said "All right, we'll hear, like to hear..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, that professor wanted to hear, that's all right. So I... My conclusion was that "Your communistic idea has not very much improved from our idea, because you cannot do without surrendering. Our Kṛṣṇa philosophy is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. So your surrendering process is there. You have not improved. You say God consciousness or Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not good, but you have not improved, because instead of Kṛṣṇa, you have surrendered to Lenin. That's all. So you have to surrender in any circumstance. Either you become communist or this 'ist' or that 'ist,' you have to surrender."

**Reporter:**
That's it. And you will go to [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
This is a fact. This is a fact. You have to surrender to your senses. That's all. And we are simply recommending surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. That's all. By surrendering to senses you are not happy, but if you surrender to Kṛṣṇa you will be happy. Your surrender is there always. You cannot say that "I don't surrender to anybody." That is nonsense.

**Reporter:**
There should be right surrender.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Reporter:**
There should be...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because you are [indistinct], it is better to surrender and be peaceful. [break] ...here, there, here, there, here. Kṛṣṇa says, "No. That surrender will not help you. Just surrender to Me, you will be happy." So intelligent person will feel that "If I have to surrender, why not to Kṛṣṇa? Why surrender to some foolish man? Let me surrender to Kṛṣṇa. If my business is to surrender, I cannot do without surrender." That is intelligence. That Kṛṣṇa says,

> bahūnāṁ janmanām ante
> jñānavān māṁ prapadyate
> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti
> sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ
> [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]

Therefore who surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, he is //mahātmā.// It is very rare //mahātmā, su-durlabhaḥ.// So anyone who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, they are //mahātmā.// They are not ordinary men. So //mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ.//

**Reporter:**
Sir... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
We have to surrender, that's a fact. But we refuse to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. That is our disease. He is not free, just like in a state, just like in Mahatma Gandhi's time, so many started civil disobedience, but the government brought them all into prison, and they obliged them to obey. Similarly, our position is that... [end]
