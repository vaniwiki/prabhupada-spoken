**Prabhupāda:**
So only you have got only //mṛdaṅga?// Why?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think more are coming from Calcutta. Śyāmasundara called me.

**Prabhupāda:**
At least four //khols// you want to have. Four //khols// and sixteen men, that is party. Yes. And one leading singer and one dancer. That makes complete party. Twenty, twenty-two men. So where is Śyāmasundara?

**Devotee:**
I didn't find him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee:**
I didn't find him anywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is not here? Huh? Resting? [background discussion among devotees] He went to bed very late last night?

**Devotee (2):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm.

**Devotee (2):**
He was trying to finish the Māyāpur thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, oh, that's all right. Let him remain. So you can speak some discussion from our books? You can see he is very great speaker, Viṣala prabhu.

**Viṣala:**
Me?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Viṣala:**
I cannot speak. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Viṣala:**
I've been reading the //Brahma-saṁhitā,// and uh, by His Divine Grace Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, and he mentions that to receive the mercy of..., Kṛṣṇa's mercy, one has to be free of all mundane desires, and also he has to receive the grace of God at the same time. So it's all, it's like the son, he mentions. He doesn't know how wealthy his father is, but by the grace of his father, he says, "My dear son, I have a lot of money and I..., you will be in my will, and you will have this all and I will give you all these instructions." So similarly, by finally gradually becoming free of all mundane desires and completely being influenced by the //cit// potency, by the superior cognitive energy of Lord Kṛṣṇa, one will receive the mercy of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. But the most important thing is to receive the mercy of the spiritual master, because only by the guru's mercy can one be blessed by God. So that means we have... [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's been reading your //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// every morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We've been reading Śrīla..., //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, read.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should I get a copy of that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So here is microphone. You did not know? Śrīmatī has brought two microphones.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yours?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, just see.

**Devotee (2):**
There's tapes also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (2):**
Some tapes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's nice. Yes. Whenever somebody comes from there, something must be brought, because these things are not available. [break] ...Indian, you cannot excel in mechanical knowledge the Europeans, American. That is not possible. We will always remain hundred years back. Everyone has got some special talent given by God. We should cooperate. That's it. The hand can work in this way. We cannot walk with hands. That is the business of the hand. Similarly, I cannot cut the papers with leg. So all living entities are endowed with special... We should cooperate. The hand and leg should cooperate for maintaining the whole body. Similarly, everyone should use his talent for satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection. Not compete with one another. That is mistake.

**Devotee (2):**
[unwrapping package] It's not the microphone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (2):**
I don't think it's the microphone. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They never reply.

**Devotee (2):**
It's such a big company, they...

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know what kind of big company, and their publication we do not get in India. Why? [indistinct] We cannot get in Macmillan Company. Sometimes somebody inquires, the reply, "They..., we have not published this book, this, here." They have no information.

**Devotee (1):**
We can show that one copy of that letter, and what can they do to us?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (1):**
If they try to stop us from printing, we can show them the copy of that letter that says they do not publish, and then what can they do? We have a copy of...

**Prabhupāda:**
I think we can publish all books here, because the agreement is made in USA. They have nothing to do within India. Indian law is different.

**Śyāmasundara:**
I think it's a world copyright, or else we could publish in Japan also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
I think this is a world copyright, or else we would be able to publish in Japan, in...

**Prabhupāda:**
So Japan is out of world?

**Śyāmasundara:**
It's out of U.S.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
It's out of the U.S.A.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Like India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
I think their copyright...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no.

**Śyāmasundara:**
...is binding around the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
If they want to publish, let them publish.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That I offered them, that "We are going to publish." So there was no reply.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
They did not comment and...

**Śyāmasundara:**
You already offered.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hum?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should we go chant our rounds now?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] But one thing is that all right, he can go as my relative, because as visitor if he goes, then he cannot be admitted in school.

**Guest:**
That's right.

**Prabhupāda:**
But if he goes as my unmarried grandson...

**Guest:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then he can get. So that will be done. [Hindi] So your sons are very good sons. I have got all blessings for them. [Hindi]

**Guest:**
[Hindi] You have so many grandsons, but I am the one erratic son, bad son.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] What is that problem?

**Guest:**
Material problems. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] I never told you that you give up your family life, but in family life you just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [Hindi conversation] There, there is a similar case in Lord Caitanya's time. The son became first a great devotee. So when the father came, then Caitanya Mahāprabhu, [indistinct]. Then father said, "No. He is my father." [laughs] So [Hindi conversation] Political economics and...

**Guest:**
Indian literature.

**Prabhupāda:**
Indian Literature. That's nice. So their work is proposed to...

**Guest:**
I think he should go there to study something, earn some money. That's all. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Guest:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tridhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ. Bhauma ijya-dhīḥ.// These are nationality, //ye bhauma ijya-dhīḥ,// the conception of worshiping the land, //bhauma. Bhauma// means land, //bhūmi. Ijya, ijya// means worshipable. So one who thinks that //bhauma, bhūmi,// anything made of //bhūmi,// earth, worshipable...

**Guest:**
I don't call it worshipable, Prabhupāda, but I have, I have more [indistinct] with this name, because...

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] This is all illusion. This //jananī janma bhūmi,// huh?

**Devotee:**
I'm going for Guru dasa.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Accha.// This //ijya-dhīḥ,// to worship the land of birth, but //bhārata-bhūmi// has special, it is //pūjā...//

**Guest:**
That is my contention.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not, not as nationality.

**Guest:**
Not as nationality. There are more...

**Prabhupāda:**
But the land where Lord Kṛṣṇa came, Lord Rāma came, Lord Caitanya came, that land is certainly worshipable. That is another thing. In that way...

**Guest:**
In that way I was saying that we talk more of spiritualism here. I don't know whether they talk it in other countries or not. But we do here more.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Other countries all they have got high respect for India as spiritual land. But we are killing, our present government and so-called leaders, killing that state. This is regrettable. They could hold this //Bhārata-varṣa// to the topmost summit all over the India if after independence they would have organizedly preached //Bhagavad-gītā// and the Vedic culture. That is my mission. Now whatever you may think of //Bhārata-varṣa,// outside, India is known as a poor, poorest country, because our ministers go there to beg.

**Guest (2):**
Prabhupāda, you have said that, really, what I read this morning, that if [indistinct] comes, we have to fight. Did you say to the people...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They asked me; I said.

**Guest (2):**
That's what we want to hear now, you know.

**Prabhupāda:**
So these messages are very nice?

**Devotee (3):**
What did you say to them, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
What was the language?

**Guest (2):**
When the war comes, Kṛṣṇa also said, asked Arjuna to fight.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guest (2):**
If it's a just war, you have to fight.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guest (2):**
So that if it's a just war we are going to fight. And the war is coming, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that's all right. Why should we be afraid of fighting?

**Guest (2):**
We are not afraid!

**Prabhupāda:**
We never... The //Bhagavad-gītā// never says that when enemy attacks, you become nonviolent. No, no. Never. Rather, Gandhi said that "Yes, I shall..." Somebody asked Gandhi that "If in your presence your wife or your daughter is ravaged, what you will do?" That question was there, actually. But he said that "I say nonviolence upon..."

**Guest (2):**
No, no, no. Another part. Then he said, "I'll hit him back." On that condition. He said, "If that comes all right, hit him back."

**Prabhupāda:**
He said that.

**Guest (2):**
He said, "If a //duṣṭa// does that to you, you hit her back."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is our policy. Our //ātatāyinaḥ,// the //śastra ātatāyinaḥ. Ātatāyinaḥ// means a person who usurps my property.

**Guest (2):**
A tyrant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Guest (2):**
A tyrant, //ātatāyinaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Aggressor, aggressor.

**Guest (2):**
Aggressor.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guest (2):**
//Ātatāyinaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Who sets fire in my home and who wants to kill me, they're called //ātatāyinaḥ.// So they should be immediately killed. There's no question of nonviolent. And if the Vaiṣṇava is insulted, he should be killed immediately. That is also, Caitanya Mahāprabhu who advised that we should be humbler than the grass, but practically when Nityānanda Prabhu was insulted, He immediately wanted to kill Jagāi and Mādhāi. So these messages...

**Guest:**
This has touched people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha, ha.

**Guest (2):**
This is what they're worried about. Did you know last time there were these signals practicing black-out and all that sort of thing? So now whole country is full of it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Lord Rāmacandra's father, Daśaratha Maharaja, about him it is written, //samūla vartham nava dhṛt ariṁśca[?].// There are many qualifications. Out of that, one qualification was //samula avartham nava dhṛt hariṁś ca.[?]// Enemy will come, then he will uproot the whole generation. //Samula vartham nava dhṛt hariṁś ca[?].//

**Guest:**
After the festival, Prabhupāda, are you going to //Vṛndāvana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I am thinking of. I have not gone for many years.

**Guest:**
Your room is very well kept there. I have been to that place myself.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Guest:**
We have seen that your room is kept well.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Guru dasa is keeping? So I can go and live in my room. The difficulty is that whenever I go, at least another half-a-dozen or dozen will go.

**Devotee:**
The entourage.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] So what shall I do? Therefore, otherwise I liked Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, but...

**Guest:**
We can find a place for them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Guest:**
We can just go and arrange it if you allow us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Guest:**
We go while the festival is on. We can arrange for your place for you and for devotees...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guest:**
...to stay. I can do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Guest:**
I'm going a couple of days earlier anyway.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. So [Hindi].

**Guest:**
Rohita.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Guest:**
Rohita.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rohita, yes, I remember.

**Guest:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Rohita. Rohita was the son of...

**Guest:**
Hariścandra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hariścandra, yes. And daughters?

**Guest:**
Daughters they will be bringing with them this evening also, the two daughters.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So how old they are?

**Guest:**
One is about seventeen.

**Prabhupāda:**
One I think ten years.

**Guest:**
Yesterday the two younger ones came. Of the two elder ones, we'll bring this evening. They are eighteen..., seventeen and eighteen.

**Prabhupāda:**
So...

**Guest:**
One is studying to be...

**Prabhupāda:**
You are trying to find out some groom? Not yet.

**Guest:**
Not yet. I have not done anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think you can get them married if you find out good boy.

**Guest:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Working.

**Guest:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Good health and working. Never mind rich or poor.

**Guest:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
You should see that he is good health and working. That's all. Not idle. So in your community I... [end]
