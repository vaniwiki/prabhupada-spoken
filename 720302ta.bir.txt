What is the use of proprietorship?

**Śyāmasundara:**
What do we care? [laughs] Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor.

**Prabhupāda:**
99 years, our life, your life, your grand your son’s life... We have to give some service so long the body is there, otherwise what shall I do with the property? Everything will remain here.

**Śyāmasundara:**
He knows that you are in a position to develop it until some.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, 99. So one bucket cold water and one bucket hot water and one soap.

[indistinct discussion] [break].

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhavānanda is a good massager.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes. How big is the property here? Does it extend around some distance?

**Prabhupāda:**

**Śyāmasundara:**

**Gurudāsa:**

**Prabhupāda:**

[break]. I was I always used to dream that you would take us to these places. [laughs] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So we require a few cars from America.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Devotee:**
Jeeps.

**Śyāmasundara:**
I think heavy Jeeps.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Cars like that rough.

**Devotee:**
Like UNICEF Jeeps.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Or Land Rovers.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all right. There is bathroom? No?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes... And some more men also I think are required.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
[indistinct] they’ll all come out.

**Gurudāsa:**
They don’t want to come anyway.

[indistinct conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
I’ve got enough for...[break]

**Devotee (2):**
Jagannath Purī also.

**Gurudāsa:**
Dvārkādīśa, where the boats.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Where is Dvārakā dhāma

**Devotee:**
Dvārakā dhāma.

**Gurudāsa:**
Dvārakā dhāma when we get some amphibious Kṛṣṇa conscious. Hare Kṛṣṇa... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
... And was purchased by Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura at Rs.150.

**Acyutānanda:**
All of it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Per biga?

**Prabhupāda:**
No for the whole plot.

**Acyutānanda:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
That was 20 //bigas.//

**Śyāmasundara:**
In Mayapur that man from the Caitanya Math has bought 150 acres.

**Acyutānanda:**
That’s about Rs.10. Less than Rs.10. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] who had some excess money in hand. [break]. After producing they want cash in their hand. The capitalist will take, hold it for some time naturally the price will increase and they will sell it. That system is still going on but it is very dangerously made.

People do not bring out the commodity they simply speculate, "I purchased it from you, you purchase it from me," so the goods are there and transaction is going on. I sell to you, you sell to him, you sell and so on and people do not get the goods. There is scarcity and it is lying somewhere and the speculation is going on.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Somewhere else.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And because the goods are not coming the market is increasing, you see. This rogueism is going on and there are so many banks although I have no money. Suppose I want to purchase one //lakh// worth of grains. Somehow or other if I have Rs.20,000 the bank will give me 80,000.

So the market is increasing, I’m not selling and when it is to my full satisfaction I sell, I pay the banks money and take a large huge profit. This is going on, in every commodity. Things are not coming out it has become gold exchange. But they will sell just at the beginning of the next season.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise they will be put into knots. [break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
No, no as long as you are here I’m not afraid.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, the population has decreased.

**Śyāmasundara:**
They have driven them away. Or killed them.

**Prabhupāda:**
When there is... Just like you do not go to the forest [indistinct] infested with many animals. Similarly they also do not come to the human society and the bigger population.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the safe, //bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syād// [SB 11.2.37], for forgetting Kṛṣṇa all the living entities they are afraid of one another.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all. They have forgotten that Kṛṣṇa is the centre he is our father. So there is no fear but that they have forgotten. Now, //īśād apetasya viparyayo 'smṛtiḥ,// they have forgotten that we are brothers. Therefore fight, we have got equal rights to enjoy the father’s property but no, I am taking more you are starving. And this is going on. Kṛṣṇa consciousness will solve all these questions.

If everyone has got the right to enjoy father’s property why one should take more? This is the best idea of communism, these things are there in //Bhāgavata. Bhāgavata// says whatever is there in the sky, whatever there is on the land and whatever there is on the water they belong to the Supreme Lord. So every living entity has the right to enjoy it as it is allotted by the Lord. This is //Bhāgavata’s// contribution.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hm. In other words if a man is born a King he is allowed to enjoy like a King?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes King is to manage these affairs.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
If everything is property of God, you are all sons of God. So King’s business is to see that nobody is encroaching upon other’s property. Nobody is fighting and he equally distributes the produce, that is the King’s duty. He has to see that whether //brāhmaṇas// are executing their duty, //kṣatriya’s, vaiśyas// according to their division, this is King’s duty. To make him Kṛṣṇa conscious but King is simply interested with the tax. No education, so-called King, and the King is finished, now the people have taken in the name of people’s government but it is an oligarch.

It is for the interests of a few men and all of them rogues and thieves just like Gandhi started indigenous manufacture. Buy sell car, by manufacturing one’s own cloth, now that became a show and the government started big big factories owned by capitalists. So Britishers were taking one //rupee// and eight //annas// per pair and they are now taking twenty-one //rupees// eight //annas.// Twenty times increase, government does not say anything because they are getting tax in different ways, excise tax, sales tax, income tax and the tax is distributed amongst the government servants. People do not get any benefit.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
20% of the tax collected, they distribute for the people’s welfare and 80% divided, divided by the governors, rajputies, secretaries and government servants---this is the position. One side the capitalist is exploiting and the government is taking tax from them and the government means a few men they are enjoying, that’s it. This is all over the world I can see, and they want that the people should be engaged in fighting in the name of nationalism and they will enjoy that’s all.

They have no good idea for the betterment of the position of the citizens. What we are doing every government should have done it---Kṛṣṇa consciousness but the rascals they simply plunder the citizens and enjoy. Wine women and flesh---this is the position. [break] [indistinct], they are //mlecchas// and taking the dress of the King, killing the whole world. [break].

[Bengali conversation]

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
[Bengali].

12 //lakhs// and all under the [indistinct] and putting a temple on that land only to get rid of it. 30 //bigas// to get the site, your site[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
Not tomorrow. The press reporter?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Oh is there a press meeting?

**Gurudāsa:**
I don’t know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
The press reporters from Navadvīpa will come.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
After four. So we must reach there by five, it will take 2 ½ hours. So by half past two we must get out.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
Half past two [Bengali].

**Prabhupāda:**
Let us...

**Lalitā Prasāda:**

**Prabhupāda:**

**Lalitā Prasāda:**

**Śyāmasundara:**
So at about 2 o’clock I will begin working on the car and try to make that horn work.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Without horn, not possible?

**Śyāmasundara:**
No, well we can do that again. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
What’s wrong with that?

**Śyāmasundara:**
It’s dangerous.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
Bell, ringing a bell.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Dinner plate.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
Bell. Hanging bell [Bengali].

**Śyāmasundara:**

**Lalitā Prasāda:**

**Śyāmasundara:**
Only from the side?

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
All the back.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Only from the side?

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
On the back.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Ah.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
Full of cataract.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Ah.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
[Bengali] This side I can see.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Ah... One eye is better than no. A one-eyed uncle is better than no uncle.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
[Bengali] this eye I had no view [Bengali]. I want a doctor to test my eye. Well life is shortened that way. Life is shortened.

**Devotees:**
Yes.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
If I operate with the cataract life will be shortened.

**Gurudāsa:**
Oh yes, yes.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
The affect on the whole system.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, yes that’s a fact.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
And even if I live for 100 years [indistinct] have to die 40 years ago. [indistinct]... Any operation lessens the longevity of life.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
Longevity of life. Because then something else has to replace that...

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
[Bengali] you are no young men [Bengali]

**Śyāmasundara:**

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hm... But when you are speaking on religious subjects then your strength comes out?

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
Beg your pardon?

**Śyāmasundara:**
You said that when you are speaking on religious subjects then your strength comes out.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
Yes, yes. On religious, I don’t see any difficulty. A sense of ploy from heaven. God sends His, I don’t know. [Bengali]. So that it is possible to sing the name of God and know what is holy.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hm.

**Lalitā Prasāda:**
They’re fond of //māyā.//

**Gurudāsa:**
Servants of //māyā.//
