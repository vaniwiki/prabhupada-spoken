**Prabhupāda:**
...or one is situated in his external existence, if he happens to remember Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu, //puṇḍarīkākṣam, sa bahyābhyantara-śuciḥ// [Garuḍa Purāṇa], he immediately becomes purified internally and externally.

So you are getting initiation in this auspicious day when Lord Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, His eternal consort, is now being situated, er, established, installed, on this auspicious moment, and you will be initiated to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// in the beginning:

> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare
> Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

As it is indicated in this verse, one who remembers the Supreme Personality of Godhead always, he remains always purified, //śuci. Śuci. Śuci// means... Another meaning of //śuci// is //brāhmaṇa,// purified.

A //brāhmaṇa...// According to nature's division, there are four classes of men: the //brāhmaṇa,// the //kṣatriyas,// the //vaiśyas// and the //śūdra. Brāhmaṇa// means the intellectual class of men who knows hygienic rules, keeps himself always purified and engaged in studying Vedic literatures for understanding this world, God, himself, the interrelation. They are called //brāhmaṇa.// And the //kṣatriya// means those who live their life under the instruction of the //brāhmaṇa// but they are engaged in administration of the state, they are called //kṣatriyas.// Then //vaiśyas,// still less intelligent class.

The //brāhmaṇa// is the first-intelligent class of men, the //kṣatriyas// the next intelligent class of men, and the //vaiśyas,// or the mercantile class of men, interested in money by trade, commerce, agriculture, industry, they are called //vaiśyas.// So next, the last class is called //śūdra. Śūdra// means workers. They haven't got much intelligence, neither they can work as administrator or traders, but they work and get some salary. They are called //śūdras.//

So //śuci// means the first-class intellectual class of men. So anyone who is always chanting the holy name of God and keeps himself purified, he is //śuci. Śuci// means the first-class purified intelligent class of man. So they are called //brāhmaṇas// in Sanskrit. So it is not that the //brāhmaṇas// are to be found in India only. Any intelligent class of men, anyone who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is //brāhmaṇa.//

In this initiation ceremony there will be some persons who will be initiated for chanting the holy name, and some of them will be initiated for the second time. They were initiated before for chanting the holy name; now they will be initiated with a sacred thread. Sacred thread means recognition of complete brahminical culture.

So a //brāhmaṇa// is, the qualification of //brāhmaṇa// is,

> satya śama dama titikṣa ārjavam
> jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyam
> brahma-karma svabhāva-jam
> [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]

So a //brāhmaṇa// should be truthful in any circumstances. He will never speak lie. Truthful, //satya. Śama. Śama// means keeping the mind always in equilibrium. And //dama, dama// means keeping the senses under control. //Śama dama titikṣa. Titikṣa// means toleration. There may be so many tribulations, but a //brāhmaṇa// is supposed to be very, very tolerant. Toleration.

The first-class example of toleration in the Western country: Lord Jesus Christ. He was being crucified; still, he did not take any steps. If he wanted, he could take steps, but he was tolerating. So this is the sign of brahminical symptom. //Titikṣa ārjava. Ārjava// means simplicity. A //brāhmaṇa// is not supposed to be crooked and duplicity. No. Simple.

It is said even the enemy wants to know something from him, he will clearly say, "It is this." That is called simplicity. Then //jñānam. Jñānam// means knowledge, full knowledge. And //vijñānam// means scientific knowledge, practical application in life. That is called //vijñānam. Āstikyam. Āstikyam// means to have full faith in Vedic literature. That is called //āstikyam.// These are the signs of //brāhmaṇa.//

So those who are going to be initiated with this sacred thread, they must always remember to follow all these rules and regulations. We should always remember that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for purifying the human society. Unless the human society is purified, there will be so many problems and disturbances in the human society.

At least a certain percentage of the human society must be //brāhmaṇa;// otherwise the society cannot make any progress in spiritual life. And if we cannot make progress in spiritual life, then our human life is frustrated. After 8,400,000 species of life, evolution, one gets this human form of life. And if he does not properly utilize it, then he is committing suicide.

So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the greatest welfare activity for the human society because this movement is educating everyone how to fulfill the aim of life. The purport of the verse:

> apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣam
> sa bahyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ
> śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu
> [Garuḍa Purāṇa]

Hare Kṛṣṇa. Now give them beads.

Stand up [indistinct]?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Translation of this [indistinct] mantra, this mantra is especially meant for those who are taking sannyas, the renounced order of life [indistinct] human society.

Translation: "I shall cross over the insurmountable ocean of darkness of ignorance simply by taking shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Mukunda, who gives all kinds of liberations and was worshiped by many great previous //ācāryas.//"

Purport. "There are sixty-four kinds of rendering service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, out of which, to accept the uniform dress of a //tridaṇḍī-sannyāsa// is also an important item. One who accepts this order of life, surely by rendering service unto the Supreme Lord, becomes eligible to cross over the insurmountable ocean of ignorance. All previous sages used to accept such order of life, and later //ācārya,// Viṣṇu Svāmī, adopted this order of life and firm conviction in the matter of devotional service.

Those who are unalloyed devotees, they add one more staff along with the original three. This extra one is representation of the living entity. There is another sect who are known as //ekadaṇḍī// sect. They misunderstand the purpose of //tridaṇḍa,//

[Śyāmasundara's purport]

...and by such deviation, Śrīvāsa Swami //sannyāsa,// who proclaimed to belong to the Viṣṇu Svāmī sect, turned to be impersonalists and follow the footsteps of Śaṅkarācārya, accepting only the //ekadaṇḍa.//

Instead of naming themselves out of the 108 names of Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsīs,// this Śrīvāsa Swami sect accepts ten names of the //sannyāsī,// following Śaṅkarācārya. Lord Caitanya, although in terms of the practice at that time, accepted //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsa// order, but He acceptance the //tridaṇḍi sannyāsa// is understood.

This //mantra// was first chanted by a learned //brāhmaṇa// of Avantipur after being very much disgusted in this materialistic way of life. This happened long, long years ago because it is mentioned in the //Bhāgavatam,// which was composed by Vyāsadeva at least five thousand years ago. So it is to be concluded, therefore, that this //tridaṇḍī sannyāsīn// order is coming down since a time long, long years ago. And within five hundred years of time Lord Caitanya adopted this order of life.

And in the latest years His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Thakur Prabhupāda adopted it personally and he made many of his disciples //tridaṇḍī sannyāsīs.// We are also following his footsteps, and the purport of this //mantra// is that the //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsī// is devoid of //paramaṁ niṣṭha,// which is explained above. In other words, impersonalists cannot have any faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they prefer to merge into the impersonal Brahman effulgence.

In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// we do not find any mention of //ekadaṇḍa sannyāsa.// This //tridaṇḍa sannyāsa// is accepted, therefore, as standard. Lord Caitanya accepts //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// as the supreme authority. Under the circumstances, persons who accept Lord Caitanya as //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsī// are mistaken. So following the footsteps of Lord Caitanya, still the //tridaṇḍī sannyāsīs// are in existence, keeping the sacred thread and //śikhā// intact, distinct from the //Māyāvādī ekadaṇḍī sannyāsīs,// who give up the sacred thread and //śikhā.//

They have no inclination to render service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Being very much disgusted by the materialistic way of life, they do not understand the purpose of the //sannyāsa// order. Those who are strictly followers of the Vaiṣṇava principles, they do not accept the //Māyāvādī// way of //sannyāsa.// In the sect of Lord Caitanya, the most venerable learned scholar known as Gadādhara Pandit Gosvāmī accepted this //tridaṇḍī sannyāsa// order, and he offered this facility to his disciple known as Śrī Mādhava Upadhyaya.

This Mādhava Ācārya is the origin of the Vallabhācārya sect. One of the Six Gosvāmīs, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, who is the authority of Vaiṣṇava regulations, was initiated by another //tridaṇḍī sannyāsī// known as Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī. Therefore this //sannyāsī// order is completely in pursuance of Vaiṣṇava authority.

**Prabhupāda:**
