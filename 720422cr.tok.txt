====== Conversation in car ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Almost they have become Europeanized.

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
In every respect.

**Sudāmā:**
The president seemed very interested, somewhat, in our philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. He's a nice gentleman. [pause] They are still satisfied with wooden house?

**Sudāmā:**
The Japanese people?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Practically our sales are improving only for their printing. Their printing is very attractive, I think.

**Sudāmā:**
Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh. You must admit that. Eh?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes. The attracting cover of a //Back to Godhead// magazine, done so nicely, and the presentation and the devotees there---a man is just inclined, "Yes, let me see. Let me see what it's about." [break]

[Prabhupāda sings //hari hari biphale// in the car]

> hari hari! bifale janama goṅāinu
> manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,
> jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu

[Pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
We say that in whatever occupation you may be, try to find out some time and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is our preaching. So it will help you. At least you will get, even if you are attached to the material activities, you will get next birth a human body, rich family, another chance, or Vaiṣṇava family. That is also great benefit. Even there is no salvation, but he gets opportunity again. [sings another line] So Karandhara Prabhu, what advantage you will get by opening that office there?

**Karandhara:**
Well, all of the communications can be done with the liaison officer. He'll have a telex, so I won't have to wait for two weeks to get a letter back. I'll just speak with him, and he can telex. And we can save the money we're spending now on telex. And sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's hard for them to understand my English, and it's hard for me to understand their English. It takes a little elaboration. So if there's a person there to speak with and he can speak with them in Japanese and with me in English, it's simpler.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Oh, there will be a great many advantages, but they have to expend for that service. They will expect some more business. That will... We think we shall be able to give him.

**Karandhara:**
Also, they should be able to... There's no reason why they can't find lots of business there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Karandhara:**
They will probably be able to find lots of other business.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā.// Oh, yes. Therefore they are... Not that they are coming for our business.

**Sudāmā:**
Right. Because they are businessmen, they have intelligent mind to use.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are... This is only starting. Otherwise, they'll have enough business.

**Karandhara:**
We've introduced them... Mr. Oyage, he's in Los Angeles now. We've introduced him to a big printing agent. So he may make some more business also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. They will get. Automatically they will get.

[//japa//] [sings //hari hari biphale//]

> hari hari! bifale janama goṅāinu
> manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,
> jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu

Is it far?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[//japa//] Some new devotees are joining us in our all centers?

**Karandhara:**
Yes. Not so many as before, but the ones that are coming are much more fixed up. Before, some would... Ten would come and seven would leave. But now they don't come so much, but when they come, they stay.

**Prabhupāda:**
They stay.

[sings softly]

> hari hari! bifale janama goṅāinu
> manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā

The students dress like policemen?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes. They all wear uniform. Girls as well. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Karandhara:**
Right now there are twelve //brahmacārīs// in Los Angeles who are getting ready to go to India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Karandhara:**
They'll be going on about the 5th of May, the 6th of May. I think also the same number in New York are preparing to go.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now we have got enough place. Yes. Very nice place, Vṛndāvana. And we are expected to get another place at Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's birthplace.

**Sudāmā:**
Ohhh.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that is very nice place also. [pause] [//japa//] [end]
