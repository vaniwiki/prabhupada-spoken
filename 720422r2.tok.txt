**Prabhupāda:**
..."Necessity and Chance"?

**Pradyumna:**
"Chance and Necessity."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is whole theory of the atheist class men.

**Pradyumna:**
Ohhh.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Aparaspara... Aparaspara...// Just like one man and woman unites all of a sudden, and there is pregnancy. This is chance.

**Pradyumna:**
Ohh. By sex desire alone the world is created by...

**Prabhupāda:**
Sex. Yes. //Kim anyat kāma-haitukam// [[books:bg:16:8|[Bg. 16.8]]]. //Kim anyat kāma-haitukam:// "Except sex desire, where is the other cause of creation?" That is atheistic theory. //Kim anyat kāma-haitukam.// So all of a sudden two opposite parties become sexually inclined, and by chance there is pregnancy and there is production.

This is their theory. There is no plan. It is like this. Because they are creating like that, there is no plan. Then why there is...? Therefore they say, "It is legalized prostitution, marriage. There is no need of marriage."

**Pradyumna:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
"Why should we go under legal?"

**Pradyumna:**
"Why should there be a plan when it comes..."

**Prabhupāda:**
This is... This is their atheistic theory. But our Vedic civilization is, //putrārthe kriyate bhārya putra-piṇḍa-prayojanam. Prayojanam. Piṇḍa, piṇḍa-dāna,// offering //piṇḍa// by the son, is necessity, //puṇyena narakāt trāyate,// because the son delivers the forefathers from the hellish condition of life. There are so many plans, and they say, "Oh, there is no plan." Ignorance.

We say that there is necessity of a //putra,// or a son; therefore to have a son, a wife is necessary. Therefore wife is accepted. This is a plan. But they say that it is... "Whenever you feel, just like cats and dogs, sexually inclined, have sex." That's all. Where is plan?

This is difference between atheist and theist. They have no plan. Sex desire is necessity of the body we have, and all of a sudden there is pregnancy. Avoid. Try to avoid pregnancy by contraceptive. Or if it takes place by chance, that's all right. There is no question of plan.

These rubbish theories are going on, and they are getting Nobel Prize. They are educated. They are philosopher. John Lennon is a philosopher. [laughs] You see? This is going on. Ginsberg is a big man. George Harrison is a big man. You see? //Eraṇḍāpi dhūmayate//[?]. When there is no tree, that, what is called? Castor tree, castor.

**Devotee:**
Castor

**Prabhupāda:**
Castor. //Eraṇḍa.// It doesn't become higher than this [gesticulates]. "Oh, here is a big tree. Here is a big tree." Where there is no tree, that tree is big tree. So when the world is finished of all intelligent men, George Harrison is big man, George [sic] Ginsberg is big man, John Lennon is big man. Just see. According to Vedic civilization they are fourth-class men.

This dramatic art was being done by a professional fourth-class man. //Nāṭaka, vidagadha//[?]. Just like Kṛṣṇa was taking bath with His friends, and there were some professional musician. They were playing music. And after taking bath, all the clothes were given to them. [break] [end]
