**Prabhupāda:**
[//prema-dhvani//] Thank you very much. [devotees offer obeisances] Hmm. So, where is Pradyumna?

**Devotee:**
He's typing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why? One //śloka.// Yes, you can... Anyone can chant.

[//japa//] [pause] One verse.

**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting]

> dharmārtha uttama-ślokaṁ
> tantuḥ tanvan pitṝn yajet
> rakṣā-kāmaḥ puṇya-janān
> ojas-kāmo marud-gaṇān
> [[books:sb:2:3:8|[SB 2.3.8]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where are those books? These small books?

[pause] My spectacle? Nobody's here?

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Nanda-kumāra? Sleeping? As soon as there is opportunity, sleep. [laughter]

[break] [//japa//]

//Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau.// One has to conquer over sleeping, eating and sense enjoyment. //Nidrā, nidrā// means sleeping. //Āhāra// means eating or collecting more. Collecting. Eating, sleeping and //vihāra,// sense gratification. //Vijitau:// the Gosvāmīs, they conquered over that.

**Śyāmasundara:**
He said he's making //kacaurīs// right now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

> rājya-kāmo manūn devān
> nirṛtiṁ tv abhicaran yajet 
> kāma-kāmo yajet som...
> [[books:sb:2:3:9|[SB 2.3.9]]]

No, not this. [leads chanting] [devotees repeat]

> dharmārtha uttama-ślokam
> tantuḥ tanvan pitṝn yajet
> rakṣā-kāmaḥ puṇya-janān
> ojas-kāmo marud-gaṇān
> [[books:sb:2:3:8|[SB 2.3.8]]]

Hmm. Repeat, repeat again.

**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of //śloka//] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

> dharmārtha uttama-ślokam
> tantuḥ tanvan pitṝn yajet
> rakṣā-kāmaḥ puṇya-janān
> ojas-kāmo marud-gaṇān
> [[books:sb:2:3:8|[SB 2.3.8]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Next, anybody? [devotee chants]

That's all right. So, word meaning?

**Pradyumna:**
//dharma-arthaḥ//---for spiritual advancement; //uttama-ślokam...,// er //rājya-kāmaḥ//---anyone desiring an empire or a kingdom...

**Prabhupāda:**
No...

**Pradyumna:**
//...tantuḥ//---for offspring; //tanvan//---and for their protection; //pitṝn//---the residents of the Pitṛloka; //yajet//---must worship; //rakṣā-kāmaḥ//---one who desires protection; //puṇya-janān//---pious persons; //ojaḥ-kāmaḥ//---one who desires strength should worship; //marut-gaṇān//---the demigods.

[08:40]

Translation: "One should worship Lord Viṣṇu or His devotee for spiritual advancement of knowledge, and for protection of heredity and advancement of the dynasty one should worship the different demigods."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Other line is not translated? Hmm. Then?

**Pradyumna:**
Purport?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm.

**Pradyumna:**
Purport: "The path of religion entails making progress on the path of spiritual advancement, ultimately reviving the eternal relation with Lord Viṣṇu in His impersonal effulgence, localized Paramātmā feature and, ultimately, in His personal feature by spiritual advancement of knowledge. And one who wants to establish a good dynasty and be happy in the progress of temporary bodily relations should take shelter of the //pitās// and the demigods in other pious planets. Such different classes of worshipers of different demigods may ultimately reach the respective planets within the universe, but he who reaches the spiritual planets in the //brahma-jyotir// achieves the highest perfection."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. So, now... [devotees chant //japa//] [break]

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] water [indistinct]. After every //mantra// I will chant //oṁ apavitraḥ.// [leads devotees in chanting]

> oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bahyābhyantara-śuciḥ
> 
> śrī-viṣṇu śrī-viṣṇu śrī-viṣṇu
> [Garuḍa Purāṇa]

**Prabhupāda:**
The word is //abhyantaram.// The word is //abhyantara. Abhyantara// means inside. [//japa//]

**Devotee:**
[leads devotees in chanting]

> oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bahyābhyantara...

**Prabhupāda:**
//abhyantaram.//

**Devotee:**

> -śuciḥ
> śrī-viṣṇu śrī-viṣṇu śrī-viṣṇu

> oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
