**Prabhupāda:**
Chant.

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// Page 141, text number 13. [leads chanting of verse] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

> śaunaka uvāca
> ity abhivyāhṛtaṁ rājā
> niśamya bharatarṣabhaḥ
> kim anyat pṛṣṭavān bhūyo
> vaiyāsakim ṛṣiṁ kavim
> [[books:sb:2:3:13|[SB 2.3.13]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
[interrupts the chanting of the verse to correct devotees] It should be pronounced like "//it yabhi vyāhṛtaṁ rājā." It yabhi vyāhṛtaṁ rājā.// [devotees repeat] //It yabhi vyāhṛtaṁ rājā niśamya bharatarṣabhaḥ.// Like that. Go on. [chanting continues, with corrections]

That's all. Now, word meaning.

**Pradyumna:**
[reads synonyms]

//iti//---thus; //abhivyāhṛtam//---all that was spoken; //rājā//---the King; //niśamya//---by hearing; //bharata-ṛṣabhaḥ//---Mahārāja Parīkṣit; //kim//---what; //anyat//---more; //pṛṣṭavān//---did he inquire from him; //bhūyaḥ//---again; //vaiyāsakim//---unto the son of Vyāsadeva; //ṛṣim//---one who is well versed; //kavim//---poetic.

[08:10]

Translation: "Śaunaka said: The son of Vyāsadeva, Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, was a highly learned sage and was able to describe things in a poetic manner. What did Mahārāja Parīkṣit again inquire from him after hearing all that he said?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm. So Vaiṣṇava, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, is learned and poet. So these are the qualification of Vaiṣṇava. As you know, there are twenty-six qualification mentioned in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// and one of the qualification is //kavi,// poet. Every Vaiṣṇava in our disciplic succession, all the Vaiṣṇavas... In the later ages, within two hundred years... During Caitanya Mahāprabhu's time there were Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, Vaiṣṇava; Locana dāsa Ṭhākura; Kavi-karṇapūra. They were all big poets. Later on, Vidyāpati, Caṇḍīdāsa. No, Caṇḍīdāsa before Lord Caitanya. Jayadeva. He also, before Lord Caitanya. All big, big //kavis.// The Jayadeva //kavi's,// this //pralaya-payodhi-jale dhṛtavān asi vedam.//

So a Vaiṣṇava devotee of the Lord is expected to have all good qualities. The more you become advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all the good qualities that were covered by the cloud of //māyā// will come out. Good qualities are already there. Just like Kṛṣṇa has got sixty-four good qualities in full, and we are minute particles of Kṛṣṇa; therefore we have got also those good qualities in minute particles. But these good qualities are now covered. Just like fire is covered by the ashes, so it does not act. Although there is fire, but when it is covered with ashes, it does not act.

So we are fire. Kṛṣṇa is fire; we are also fires, in quality. Just there is a very... There is a big fire, blazing fire, and the sparks, the sparks are also fire. Therefore we sometimes desire to imitate Kṛṣṇa. Because we have got these qualities in minute quantity, so we think that "I am God. I have become." But we do not know the quantitative difference. That we forget. We can say we are God, but teeny God, not the Supreme God. Spark. Fire, blazing fire, and the spark. Now this quality, fire, this also becomes almost unseen when we are in this material world. Just like if the fire sparks fall down out of the blazing fire, it becomes extinguished. So in order to ignite again our fiery quality, we must go back to the original fire. Then the fiery quality, the brilliant fiery quality, will again be exhibited.

This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So when we are in the process of going back to home, back to Godhead, out of so many qualities, twenty-six quality becomes very... At least, they become manifest. And out of the twenty-six qualities, one quality is to become a poet. Poet he is. Nobody can become poet unless he is poet. So //kavi.// And //ṛṣi. Ṛṣi, muni-ṛṣi,// those who are philosophers, learned scholars, they are called //muni-ṛṣi.//

So? Read the purport.

**Pradyumna:**
"A pure devotee of the Lord automatically develops all godly qualities, and some of the prominent features of those qualities are as follows: He is kind, peaceful, truthful, equable, faultless, magnanimous, mild, clean, nonpossessive, a well-wisher to all, satisfied, surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, without hankering, simple, fixed, self-controlled, a balanced eater, sane, mannerly, prideless, grave, sympathetic, friendly, poetic, expert and silent. Out of these twenty-six prominent features..."

**Prabhupāda:**
So with the advancement of our spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we should verify, "Whether these qualifications are becoming manifest in my person." Just like when you eat, you understand that you are getting strength, or your appetite is being satisfied. Nobody can... Nobody requires to ask certificate. You can understand, yourself. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. If we are advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then our detachment for material things will..., attachment for material things will decrease.

This is one side. //Viraktir anyatra syāt.// Just like our students, they have become averse to so many things. You are all young boys and girls. So many young boys and girls are going to restaurant, to cinema, and so many other things, but you have become detached; you have no more attraction. So one side... Progress of //bhakti// means one side we shall be detached, and another side we shall increase our attachment. So these are the qualification.

The first qualification is "kind." Just like these //sannyāsīs.// Our Rūpānuga Gosvāmī, he has got a nice child, wife, nice wife. But, being kind to the humanity, he has accepted //sannyāsa.// This is kindness. No homely comfort. This is kindness. //Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.//

> tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat 
> bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna-kanthāśritau
> [Śrī Ṣaḍ Gosvāmy Aṣṭaka 4]

Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, they were ministers. Ministers, not ordinary men. And therefore their association was most aristocratic. //Maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīm. Maṇḍala-pati// means big, big man, who have got many followers, leaders of the society. So he gave up that association, //tuccha-vat,// "Eh, what is this nonsense?" Gave up, Rūpa Gosvāmī. //Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat. Tuccha// means very insignificant, "What is this?" Then what did they do? What he became? //Bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna-kanthāśritau.// You have seen Rūpa Gosvāmī's picture---only a little cloth, //kanthā. Kanthā// means handmade quilt. All rejected cloth, they are put together and sewn; it is called //kanthā.// They utilize even rejected cloth. That is called //kanthā.//

So this Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī accepted this mendicant life although they were ministers, very rich men. Not only Rūpa Gosvāmī; all the Gosvāmīs. Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī was the only son of his father and uncle, and in those days the income was twelve //lakhs,// twelve hundred thousands of rupees. Almost king. So for being compassionate with these poor fellow who have forgotten Kṛṣṇa and working simply unnecessarily so hard to get some bread, that's all---//mūḍha//---so by becoming kind upon them, they took this mendicant order. Therefore kindness. And peaceful. Vaiṣṇava is never turbulent. But the demons, they create disturbance. Vaiṣṇava is peaceful. Peaceful, truthful. Truthful. A Vaiṣṇava knows the ultimate truth: Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he's truthful.

And equable. He has no distinction, "Oh, here is a man, here is an animal. The animal has no soul; the man is soul." They have no such conclusion. Every living entity has soul. As Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. So he's kind not only to the human society. These philanthropist, altruist, nationalist, this-//ists,// that-//ist,// this..., they are partial. First of all, they are..., may be kind---they are not kind; they are all selfish---but even though they are kind, they are kind to their own men, not even outsiders. Not to the outsiders. In your country, they will throw away grains. But there are so many hungry people; why they should not give? Produce more, if you have got land, you have got men. And they are not producing, they are not engaging. The men are becoming hippies, and they're lying idle, without any production. God has given so much land. Work. Produce. Distribute //prasādam.// This is kindness. But because they are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, they cannot be kind.

Faultless. You cannot find any fault of the devotee. Faultless. Magnanimous: thinking of all living entities. There is no distinction, "Oh, I am American, I shall think for the Americans," "I am Indian, I shall think for..." No. Magnanimous. And the most magnanimous is Lord Caitanya. //Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. Magnanimous, giving //kṛṣṇa-prema,// which is very rare. Kṛṣṇa says, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. It is very difficult to understand what is Kṛṣṇa, and Lord Caitanya is distributing Kṛṣṇa like anything. Therefore //mahā-vadānyāya,// magnanimous.

Mild. Mild and meek. Clean. Always cleanliness. Because they have surpassed the stage of brahminical life. Therefore, must be very clean: by taking bath, by washing cloth, keeping the kitchen very clean, everything clean. Temples... //Tan-mandira-mārjanādisu.//

//Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārjanādau.// The temple should be, I mean, bright, always clean. Then nonpossessive. Materialistic person, they are trying to possess more, more, more. A Vaiṣṇava, simply what is absolutely necessary must have. Just like we don't keep any furniture in our hou... What is the use of furniture? We can lie down on the floor. So many things, materialistic persons they possess. But we try to simplify the matter, plain living.

Well-wisher to all. Well-wisher. Just like we are advising our all student that "Save your country. They are becoming hippies. It is not... Future is very gloom. Try to save them." So Vaiṣṇava will always think like that, how people will be happy. //Sarve sukhino bhavantu.// A Vaiṣṇava desire is not exploitation. Vaiṣṇava desire is that "How others will be happy. How they will understand Kṛṣṇa. How they will get happiness in this life and next life." This is Vaiṣṇava.

Satisfied, in any condition. Not that "I must have all these things; then I'll be satisfied. Otherwise, I'm going from the temple." [laughs] No, this is not Vaiṣṇava qualification. You must live with the devotees, even if you are not satisfied. Any condition, you should be satisfied. Because as soon as you leave the company, you become again rogues, again demon. At least you'll be saved if you keep with the company of the devotees. //Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvidaḥ// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]. If you give up the company, then you again become rogues and demons. Therefore you must be satisfied, in whatever condition. "Whatever Kṛṣṇa has given, that's all right." Satisfied.

Surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. And that satisfaction can be achieved only when one is fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. If I have surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa has taken my charge, Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], then why shall I bother myself? If I am thinking, "I am suffering," it is also Kṛṣṇa's grace. We should take like that. Even in my consideration I am in a position which is apparently suffering, we must accept as Kṛṣṇa's grace: "All right, I have surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa is giving me suffering, that's all right." That is surrender. "Oh, I have surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, and now Kṛṣṇa is giving me suffering? Oh, leave Kṛṣṇa consciousness," that is not surrender. Surrender means in any condition you'll remain surrendered. That is surrender. Not that I put my own condition, and if you satisfy me, then I shall... That is business; that is not surrender. Surrender means in any condition, fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa.

Without hankering. What is the hankering? Why shall I be hankering? I know Kṛṣṇa will give me all protection; otherwise, why shall I hanker? Without hankering. Simple; no duplicity. Simple. The worldly men, they are duplicitous, speaking something cheater. That is the..., one of the qualification of materialistic man. He must be a cheater. There are four defects: commit mistake, to be illusioned, to become cheater, and imperfect senses. This is called material life, conditioned life. He must commit mistakes. However a great philosopher...

We are talking about the philosophers; so many contradictory things they say. Because he's an ordinary man. How he can say the right thing? It is not possible. The right thing can be said only by liberated person. Therefore we take advice from the liberated person. Just like we are understanding all these from Vyāsadeva, from Śukadeva Gosvāmī. They are liberated. We are not reading some Mr. John R. Meade's book. No. Liberated soul. So that should be our source of knowledge.

Mannerly, prideless, grave. Grave means don't talk nonsense. Don't talk nonsense. Don't waste time. If you have got time, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, but don't talk nonsense. Grave. That is called gravity. Grave. Sympathetic. We should be very much sympathetic. If some of our fellow men fall sick, we must take care of him, give help him.... Because, after all, we have got this body. Sometimes we may fall sick. So one..., we should be sympathetic. And friendly. Everyone friend. As Kṛṣṇa is friend of everyone, //suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]], so if we are Kṛṣṇa's representative, how I can be enemy of anyone else? I must be friendly. Friendly. Poet. And expert. And silent. Silent worker, not advertising. Silent. These are the qualifications of Vaiṣṇava. So we must try to follow; not imitate, but follow. Follow, that is nice.

Then?

**Pradyumna:**
"Out of these twenty-six prominent features of a devotee, as described by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja in his //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// the qualification of being poetic is especially mentioned herein in relation to Śukadeva Gosvāmī. The presentation of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// by his recitation is the highest poetic contribution. He was a self-realized, learned sage. In other words, he was a poet amongst the sages. "

**Prabhupāda:**
