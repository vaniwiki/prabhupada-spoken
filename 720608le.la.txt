**Prabhupāda:**
The person in knowledge, he must see that "I cannot avoid death, I cannot avoid birth, I cannot avoid old age, I cannot avoid disease so long I have got this material body." But Kṛṣṇa says, //janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]: "Anyone who understands Me in reality, what I am, then he immediately becomes immune from these four things." //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. After giving up this... This body we have to give up. And then next body, //tathā dehāntara-prāptir...// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]] So a devotee at least is not going to be cats and dogs or trees.

The nondevotees, they are. Now they are... Now the modern advancement is to be naked. So these people are going to be trees. You know Yamalārjuna. You have seen the picture. They were dancing, and they were taking bath naked, and they were not ashamed when Nārada Muni was passing. So he cursed them that "You are so fool, you have lost your sense. All right, next life you become a tree, immediately."

So these senseless, shameless persons who are advancing in their knowledge by becoming naked, they are going to be tree next life. The naked tree is standing naked for many thousands of years. Or animals---they have no shame. So if human being becomes so shameless, then next life is to become animal and trees. But in the universities, they say that "What is the wrong if I become an animal?"

I asked them, "Do you like to be animal?" "Yes." "Then all right, next time you become animal. [laughter] This is your... I give you this blessing. That's all." [laughter] Flatly said, "Yes, yes, I will be happy." All right, say it. Kṛṣṇa is so kind: "You want to be naked? All right, you become naked for ten thousand years and stand up."

So therefore to save ourself from degradation, to save our this life... We are actually, we are all eternal, but because we don't want Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we want animal consciousness, tree consciousness, animal consciousness. So Kṛṣṇa is very kind: "All right, you become tree. What can I do?" Kṛṣṇa is always ready to give you all facilities.

Now it is up to you to make your choice whether you are going to dance with Kṛṣṇa or you want to become naked tree standing for ten thousands of years. That is your choice. A living entity has got this independence. Just like Kṛṣṇa asking Arjuna, //yathecchasi tathā kuru// [[books:bg:18:63|[Bg. 18.63]]]: "I have spoken to you about things as they are. Now it is up to you to make your choice. Whatever you like, you can do."

So Kṛṣṇa is so merciful, //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante...// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. If you want from Kṛṣṇa that you want to become a tree, so it is not very difficult for Kṛṣṇa to make you a tree. He's all-powerful. He can do that. But if you want, "Kṛṣṇa, I want to be with You personally," that also Kṛṣṇa can give you.

So now make your choice. This is the human form of life. The animal cannot. The //śāstras,// the messages are not for the animals; it is for the human being. Therefore don't spoil your life. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you.
