**Pradyumna:**
...name of the Lord is identical with the Lord Himself.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that great rascal says that Kṛṣṇa...

**Devotee:**
"Kṛṣṇa is the chief of the tribe that lived in Central India."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see, and he's passing on as a great scholar, such a rascal.

**Devotee:**
He had 10,000, ah, subjects. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
All the //ācāryas//---Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Lord Caitanya---all of them become nullified, and this rascal comes forward to defy all the //ācāryas// and push some new theory. Just see. This is going on. [Sanskrit] In the //Varāha Purāṇa// it is stated that some of the //rākṣasas,// they will take advantage of Kali-yuga and take birth in //brāhmaṇa// families, so he is one of them, this //rākṣasa.// And now he is suffering for that. Greatest calamity, you see? And according to Vedic injunction, the king, if he levies tax from the subjects who are sinful, then he has to partake of the sinful action and he'll have to suffer.

So, this rascal became the president of India. It is the position of king, and on the [indistinct] of him he supported the slaughterhouses and levied taxes, and he took high salary, enjoyed it. Now he is suffering the effect, sinful effect. Now in his living condition he has lost his brain. He, practically dead, but living condition, it is very precarious condition. One is living actually, but his brain is not acting. Worse than a madman. So this is the result of the //rākṣasa// statement.

Yes, go on. [end]
