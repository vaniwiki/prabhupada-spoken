**Prabhupāda:**
So I am going out of station for few days. I shall come back again very soon.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
In the meantime, you go on holding this class, morning, regularly, one //śloka// from //Bhāgavata;// thoroughly discuss for one hour; //kīrtana.//

Besides that, our other regular program should go on. Nothing should be hampered. That is my request. Live peacefully and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
