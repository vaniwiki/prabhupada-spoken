**Devotee (1):**
A brush.

**Prabhupāda:**
No soap?

**Devotee (1):**
I don't think so. It's wire, metal.

**Prabhupāda:**
What?

**Devotee (1):**
It's a metal brush. It would be too hard for the nails, for the body.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yeah. For toes? For toenails.

**Devotee (1):**
For feet?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Toenails, perhaps.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] cord?

**Devotee (1):**
Silk cord?

**Prabhupāda:**
What is it meant?

**Devotee:**
Round the neck. Some brass shoes. [loud noises of fireworks exploding]

**Prabhupāda:**
You [indistinct]?

**Devotee (1):**
Match your bead bag.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (1):**
It will match your bead bag.

**Devotee (2):**
Handkerchief.

**Prabhupāda:**
Popularly. [laughter]

**Devotee (1):**
//Time// magazine, special issue.

**Prabhupāda:**
[devotees are laughing as they look at magazine] First name [indistinct]? What is that?

**Devotee (1):**
It says "Vai..., Vaikuṇṭha Playhouse, statement of purpose." There's a theatrical group called the Vaikuṇṭha Players. [break]

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
...Śrīla Prabhupāda, Fourth of July.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
It's Fourth of July.

**Prabhupāda:**
Today?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Keep it all in //almirah.//

**Devotee (1):**
This is some peanuts.

**Prabhupāda:**
Distribute.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
It's a very sad day for us, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
It's a sad day for us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sad day?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Sad.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
You have, [indistinct] very limited opportunity for associating, so offensively. You'll be leaving today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
You'll be going away.

**Prabhupāda:**
Home-made soap you can make?

**Devotee (1):**
I could make it if I found out how. I don't know the ingredients.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Devotee (1):**
I don't know the ingredients, but I could find out the ingredients and the process. I could try.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who can make home-made soap. You can?

**Devotee (3):**
We will be making in...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (3):**
...the Spiritual Sky business. We'll be making. It's the same business, this soap, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is not needed.

**Devotee (1):**
[indistinct] [fireworks explode]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is [indistinct].

**Devotee (1):**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...a cheater is not disqualification in this country.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
It's a good qualification.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Good qualification.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Biggest cheaters are in control, in charge.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the disqualification? Not to become cheater?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes, then they will be stupid.

**Devotee (4):**
To be an honest man.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
See, then they call you stupid.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. The standard is different, completely. Human intelligence means you must be a big cheater.

**Devotee (1):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah?

**Devotee (1):**
What would you like to take for lunch today?

**Prabhupāda:**
I'm not feeling very much hungry. Don't prepare now. If I feel hungry, it can be done. Call Śyāmasundara.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Would you have any instructions as to how I could serve you better? For me?

**Prabhupāda:**
By convincing people of... [end]
