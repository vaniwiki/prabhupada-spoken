**Prabhupāda:**
[leads singing of //Jaya Rādhā-Mādhava//] [//prema-dhvani//] Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [devotees offer obeisances]

**Prabhupāda:**
[hums] Wait. Yes.

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [leads chanting of verse] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

> munayaḥ sādhu pṛṣṭo 'haṁ
> bhavadbhir loka-maṅgalam
> yat kṛtaḥ kṛṣṇa-sampraśno
> yenātmā suprasīdati
> [[books:sb:1:2:5|[SB 1.2.5]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. Thank you. Yes? [more devotees chant]

Now, word meaning.

**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of synonyms]

//munayaḥ//---of the sages; //sādhu//---this is relevant; //pṛṣṭaḥ//---questioned; //aham//---myself; //bhavadbhiḥ//---by all of you; //loka//---the world; //maṅgalam//---welfare; //yat//---because; //kṛtaḥ//---made; //kṛṣṇa//---the Personality of Godhead; //sampraśnaḥ//---relevant question; //yena//---by which; //ātmā//---self; //suprasīdati//---completely pleased.

[11:54]

Translation: "O sages, I have been justly questioned by you. Your questions are worthy because they relate to Lord Kṛṣṇa and so are of relevance to the world's welfare. Only questions of this sort are capable of completely satisfying the self."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. So questioning about Kṛṣṇa and answering the question is //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// So here it is recommended that if we are constantly engaged in //kṛṣṇa-kathā// about Kṛṣṇa, talking about Kṛṣṇa, questioning about Kṛṣṇa, then //ātmā suprasīdati.// We are hankering after peacefulness of our heart, peacefulness of our atmosphere. So here it is recommended that simply by inquiring about Kṛṣṇa and taking answer of the question, both the questioner and the answer-giver, both will be pleased. //Yenātmā suprasīdati.//

Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered, //yāre dekha, tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. The world is like the blazing fire in the forest. So this //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, will give them relief. //Yenātmā suprasīdati.// And the Sūta Gosvāmī said, "Your question is very pious question, //sādhu,// because it is about Kṛṣṇa."

The question was that "After the departure of Kṛṣṇa..." //Dharmaḥ kam...// What is that? //Śaraṇaṁ gataḥ?// Hmm? //Kāṣṭhām...// What is this verse? //Kṛṣṇe sva-dhāmopagate...//

> brūhi yogeśvare kṛṣṇe
> brahmaṇye dharma-varmaṇi
> svāṁ kāṣṭhām adhunopete
> dharmaḥ kaṁ śaraṇaṁ gataḥ
> [[books:sb:1:1:23|[SB 1.1.23]]]

This is the inquiry. The answer is given there, that "Your inquiry..." Kṛṣṇa comes for reestablishing the principles of religion. Religion means the order set by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is religion: "You do like this." Just like king's..., king orders, or the government orders, "Do like this." Do's and does not, do not's. Do's and do not's. So that is //dharma.// If you follow the do's and do not's given by Kṛṣṇa, that is religion. You cannot manufacture religion. That is bogus.

So //munayaḥ sādhu pṛṣṭo 'haṁ bhavadbhir loka-maṅgalam// [[books:sb:1:2:5|[SB 1.2.5]]]. "These questions..." Just like our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the same: it is simply questioning about Kṛṣṇa and hearing the answer. It is //loka-maṅgalam.// Anywhere this vibration will go on, there will be all auspicity. //Loka-maṅgalam. Kṛṣṇa-sampraśno yenātmā suprasīdati.// Another feature is Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive; therefore, talks about Him is also attractive. In our //Kṛṣṇa// book there are so many topics about Kṛṣṇa, //janma karma me divyam// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]], about His birth, about His transference from real father's house to another foster father, then the attack by the demons upon Kṛṣṇa, Kaṁsa. All these activities, if we simply study and hear the //kṛṣṇa-sampraśnaḥ,// then we are liberated. Without any doubt, our liberation is guaranteed, simply by hearing about Kṛṣṇa.

Kṛṣṇa therefore comes, so many activities. //Na māṁ karmāṇi limpanti na me karma-phale spṛhā// [[books:bg:4:14|[Bg. 4.14]]]. Kṛṣṇa says that He has nothing to do. What He has to do? But still, He's killing so many demons, He's giving protection so many devotees. Because He has come to reestablish what is religious principle, so by His personal activities He establishes. Otherwise, Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do. He's //ātmārāma,// Kṛṣṇa. He is self-satisfied; He has nothing to do. But to teach us He comes. In this way we should live. From the very beginning of His childhood.

Read the purport.

**Pradyumna:**
"As it is stated hereinbefore, in the //Bhāgavatam// the Absolute Truth is to be known, so the questions of the sages of Naimiṣāraṇya are proper and just because they pertain to Kṛṣṇa, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth. In //Bhagavad-gītā// the Personality of Godhead says that in all the //Vedas// there is nothing but the urge for searching after Him, Lord Kṛṣṇa. [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. Thus the questions that pertain to Kṛṣṇa are the sum and substance of all the Vedic inquiries.

"The whole world is full of questions and answers. The birds..."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Athāto brahma jijñāsā. Atha,// "Now this is the time for inquiring about the Absolute Truth." "This is the time" means this human form of life. Animals cannot inquire. Therefore //Vedānta-sūtra// says, //atha, athāto brahma jijñāsā:// inquire about the Absolute Truth. //Brahmā..., brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. The ultimate Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa, the person. Paramātmā is plenary expansion, and Brahman is impersonal effulgence. So if one understands Kṛṣṇa by question and answer, then he understands the other three features. But simply by understanding the impersonal feature, Brahman effulgence, one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Neither by understanding or seeing the Paramātmā one can understand Kṛṣṇa.

To see the Paramātmā is the business of the //yogīs. Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. //Yoginaḥ,// the //yogīs,// they are trying to see Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu within their heart by meditation. Meditation means this. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ.// And the //jñānīs// they want to stop these material varieties, make it impersonal, and merge into the existence of Brahman effulgence. But devotees, they do not, neither of them, neither they even want to be transferred to the Vaikuṇṭhaloka. They are satisfied in any condition life, provided they have got the opportunity to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is their mission.

Hmm. Then?

**Pradyumna:**
"The whole world is full of questions and answers. The birds, the beasts and men are all busy in the matter of perpetual questions and answers. In the morning, the birds in the nest become busy with questions and answers, and in the evening also, the same birds come back and again become busy with questions and answers. The human being, unless he is fast asleep at night, is busy with questions and answers. The businessmen in the market are busy with questions and answers, and so also, the lawyers in the court and the students in the schools and colleges. The legislators in the parliament are also busy with questions and answers, and the politicians and the press representatives are all busy with questions and answers.

"Although they go on making such questions and answers for their whole lives, they are not at all satisfied. Satisfaction of the soul can only be obtained by questions and answers on the subject of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is our most intimate master, friend, father or son, and object of conjugal love. Forgetting Kṛṣṇa, we have created so many objects of questions and answers, but none of them are able to give us complete satisfaction."

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore, materialism means forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, there is no other existence as material. Just like in dream. In dream, some way or other we create an atmosphere. But actually, there is no different atmosphere. But by our brain, hallucination, we create something. So created in dream, we have got experience, everyone, "I am the worker. I am doing this. I am flying. I am going there. I am riding the car. I am working. I..." "I" is there. This "I," false ego, is there. //Ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]].

So forgetting Kṛṣṇa, when we concentrate only "I" and "mine," that is material. That is material. Material [indistinct] separated. When I create, when we forget Kṛṣṇa, when I create "I" and "mine," that is material. Make it clear.[?] Otherwise, //īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy. Kṛṣṇa is spiritual, therefore His energy is also spiritual. But in the spiritual energy there is the possibility of forgetting Kṛṣṇa. That is called material.

So if we remember Kṛṣṇa, that is not material. A man [indistinct], stone, wood, brick and constructs a big, high skyscraper building; that is material. But the same stone, same wood, same cement, you construct a very nice temple of Kṛṣṇa, that is spiritual energy. Now, the question is how the woods and stone, which is matter, becomes spiritual. Is not that the question?

We say one man is constructing big skyscraper building with woods and stones, we say this is materialism. But they can also challenge you that "You are also interested in woods and stones and constructing a big church or temple. Why is your idea spiritualism?" Now, you can compare. This is spiritualism means in this stone and earth and woods you remember Kṛṣṇa, "I am constructing something for Kṛṣṇa." Therefore it is spiritualism.

So the conclusion is when we forget Kṛṣṇa, that is materialism. And when we constantly remember Kṛṣṇa, that is spiritualism. The materialist means they are thinking of sense gratification. All these big, big buildings were constructed in your country, Edinburgh. The idea was that "We shall show something opulent that we are very great nation. We have got nice buildings, nice churches, nice roads." Puffed up. Everyone wants to be puffed up before his friends and relatives. So this is materialism.

But the same thing done for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, that "We shall construct this temple for Kṛṣṇa's inhabitation. We shall construct this building for providing the devotees of Kṛṣṇa so that they may be able to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// without any disturbance..." It appears the same thing, //karma// and //bhakti,// but //bhakti// is always in relation with Kṛṣṇa and //karma// is always in relation with sense gratification.

Therefore the things, the ingredients, is originally spiritual because it is Kṛṣṇa's energy. But //ahaṁ mameti,// when we try to impose our proprietorship, that is materialism. Materialism means forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, there is no materialism; everything is spiritual.

Hmm. Then?

**Pradyumna:**
"Kṛṣṇa is our most intimate master, friend, father or son, and object of conjugal love. Forgetting Kṛṣṇa, we have created so many objects of questions and answers, but none of them are able to give us complete satisfaction. All things but Kṛṣṇa give temporary satisfaction only, so if we are to have complete satisfaction we must take to the questions and answers about Kṛṣṇa. We cannot live for a moment without being questioned or without giving answers.

Because the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// deals with questions and answers that are related to Kṛṣṇa, we can derive the highest satisfaction only by reading and hearing this transcendental literature. One should learn the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and make an all-around solution to all the problems pertaining to social, political or religious matters. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and Kṛṣṇa are the sum total of all things."

**Prabhupāda:**
Now let us discuss, question and answer, "How political situation can be improved by Kṛṣṇa consciousness?" Can anyone answer? Who will answer this question? Yes?

**Pradyumna:**
If the head of the country, if the commander-in-chief of the army and the rulers and the person who dispenses justice are all devotees, they can clearly make a plan or arrangement of government so that people are informed what their real welfare is.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Pradyumna:**
So that people are informed what their real welfare is, what the real goal...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that real welfare?

**Pradyumna:**
To be... To render service to Kṛṣṇa and to serve Kṛṣṇa, and to see that everything in the country is used in Kṛṣṇa's service. If the government does that, then it becomes a Kṛṣṇa conscious government.

**Prabhupāda:**
[to the other devotees] So, is it all right?

**Revatīnandana:**
Also, if the leaders become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then they can stop the institutions of vice, which prevent the people from understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They can shut down the slaughterhouses and [indistinct]. Then their propaganda will be understood and people will become more Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Pradyumna:**
With a future of Kṛṣṇa consciousness there wouldn't be any more political maneuvering, because the leaders would be willing to accept advice from the learned sages and //brāhmaṇas// and devotees. There wouldn't be any [indistinct] politics, and there would be understanding from the scriptures.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is social improvement, er, political improvement. What is the social improvement?

**Revatīnandana:**
The social improvement would be that when the people become Kṛṣṇa conscious under good leadership, then they would be satisfied. Then they would simplify the lives of the people; everyone would become happy, and [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
The basic principle is that //yenātmā suprasīdati.// Social... //Yat kṛtaḥ kṛṣṇa-sampraśno yenātmā suprasīdati.// Every householder... Everyone is dissatisfied. There is no, I mean to say, peaceful atmosphere between the husband and the wife, the son and the father. We remain, of course, together. But everyone is of different opinion.

In your country it is very practically experienced: nobody agrees with nobody. Everyone has got his own opinion. So if Kṛṣṇa center... Even in Kṛṣṇa center we are having different opinions, because we are accustomed to live like that. But actually, if we are serious about serving Kṛṣṇa, then there cannot be two opinions. One opinion: how to serve Kṛṣṇa.

So in family life, if we introduce this //arcā-vigraha-sevā...// Every family can keep Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //vigraha,// Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's photo //vigraha,// and as we are, whatever we are doing, center is Kṛṣṇa, similarly, everyone can do that. That will solve all social problems---social problems, philosophical problems, economic problems. Economic problems, practically there is no economic...

Just like in London they are throwing away tons of tomato into the sea. That is our creation. God has given sufficient to eat, but because there is strike, we have created a problem. So if one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, what will be strike? Strike means they want money---more money, more money. There is no end. When I first came to America, in New York, there was strike of the transport men. All transport stopped---the subway, the bus, everything. People became so much in difficulty.

So without being Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is no end of sense gratification. Nobody knows. But Kṛṣṇa conscious person, they are satisfied. The... Even still in India, you'll find this satisfaction by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. A poor man, practically very meager income, but he's satisfied. He's satisfied in this way: he thinks, "Kṛṣṇa has given me this much. I must be satisfied. Kṛṣṇa has given me this much. Why shall I...?" And that is also recommendation of the //śāstra,// that //tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]]. We should not waste our time for improving our economic position. That is already settled up.

So "Whatever Kṛṣṇa will do, that is all right. Let me utilize my valuable time of this human form of life in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa." People will not agree to this. But actually, if anyone wants peace of the mind, //yenātmā suprasīdati,// then this process should be adopted. This is practical also. There are many saintly persons; they do not try where to go, where to take money or where to eat. They're busy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. "If Kṛṣṇa sends some food, I shall eat. Otherwise, it doesn't matter. I shall starve." They have got that determination, strict. They do not go anywhere, but Kṛṣṇa sends him everything.

Just like Bilvamaṅgala. He was not going anywhere. He was living in Vṛndāvana. Kṛṣṇa personally was coming to give him some milk. He became blind; he could not see. So Kṛṣṇa would come just like a boy. "Bilvamaṅgala, I think you are hungry. Will you take some milk?" Oh, he was very glad. "All right, You give me a little milk." Next day He will come. Then he would ask, "Who is this boy? I cannot see. He comes and gives me milk daily."

//Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham// [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]]. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that "Unto the devotee who is completely dependent upon Me, I carry personally whatever he needs." //Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. That one person is supplying all the necessities of all the living entities. That is God. God is not beggar. God fulfills everyone's necessities, practically. That is... People are unhappy by so-called economic development. Everyone is competing. They have no satisfaction. Without God, godless civilization has created unnecessary competition. But if people become God conscious, he'll be satisfied. //Yenātmā suprasīdati.// The very basic principle of devotional service will make one happy.

Then? [indistinct comment by devotee] All right, have //kīrtana.// [devotees offer obeisances]

[sings:] //...yenātmā suprasīdati.// So the outsiders, they do not come in morning? No. Eh?

[40:14]

[//kīrtana//] [//prema-dhvani//]

**Devotees:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [devotees offer obeisances]

[//kīrtana//] [obeisances] [end]
