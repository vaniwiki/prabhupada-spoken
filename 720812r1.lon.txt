**Prabhupāda:**
...all-round, not sentimental. There is no religion, and still, they are professing, "I profess this religion." Where is your religion? If actually there was religion in the human society, why there are so many problems? There should not have been so many problems. The problems are in the animal society. Why there should be problem in human society? Because they have given up the real principles. They are simply animals. Therefore there are so many problems.

Actually there is no problem. Even they are not animal. Less than animal. In animal society there is no problem. There is problem, but not so acute. They are free. Just like the ducks, the pigeons, they fly from one country to another. They have no problem of immigration department, passport or visa. They have no problem.

These rascals should understand that they have created problem on account of their animalistic..., less than animalistic civilization. There is no limit of sense gratification. The sense gratification, homosex, they are supporting. Just see. Just see. At least in animal society there is no homosex. They have created homosex, and that is being passed by the priest, the religious heads. You know that?

**Devotee:**
Yes, I've heard.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. If you say that they are animal civilization, that is a great credit for them. It is less than animal civilization. Write all this in papers and everything, all openly. Challenge strongly. First of all realize, then challenge.

[break] //Dharmeṇa hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ// [//Hitopadeśa//]. That is the special distinction, that their life, human life, must be based on //dharma,// religion. They have rejected //dharma.// That is another type of frustration, because the so-called leaders of religion, they could not give anything. They also exploited people under religious sentiment. Actually they could not make people religious. They did not know what is religion.

And therefore people become..., revolted: "What is this nonsense? They are living at our expenditure." We are real religious people. We are enlightening people about religion, life, about God. And these people, they simply take money and live peacefully. And drink also. Here they drink wine. In India they drink //gāñjā.// You have been Rādhā-Dāmodara temple?

**Hamsadutta:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have seen that //gosāi?//

**Hamsadutta:**
Is he still there?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Rādhā-Dāmodara is kind. And where this rascal will go? [laughter] After all, somehow or other, he is giving some service to Rādhā-Dāmodara, managing. //Api cet su-durācāro// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. [//japa//]

[break] ...should think that we have got to say so many things to the people, huh, about this. So take these ingredients, assimilate them in the brain and distribute.

**Woman devotee:**
People like it when we speak so strongly to them.

**Prabhupāda:**
They like. And you have got so many ingredients. So now you realize how many things you have to speak to the world, economic development, everything. We are not simply so-called religious people. We know everything in right way. Everything, what is to be... That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness---all round, all included.

**Revatīnandana:**
The people who listen, they become very impressed. At many programs, the students, after I finish speaking and I answer some questions, they realize that we know something very completely. They become very interested. They come around and bring more questions. Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And you will get all ideas from our books.

[to woman:] That is Indian //śaṅkha?//

**Woman:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That in your hand, bangle, white bangle.

**Woman:**
Ah, elephant?

**Prabhupāda:**
It is called //śaṅkha.// It is called //śaṅkha.// From conchshell. It is made from conchshell. Where you have purchased it?

**Woman:**
I'm afraid this is ivory.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ivory? Oh. There is similar made from conchshell.

**Woman:**
Yes, I had those in Allahabad. I was going there to... [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Allahabad? Conch, from conchshell? It is especially used in Bengal.

**Woman:**
Yes

**Prabhupāda:**
A woman... That is an auspicious sign that she is with her husband, to have conchshell bangle. //Śaṅkha-sārī.// A woman dressed //śaṅkha// and //sārī, śaṅkha-sārī.// They don't require any other ornament. One nice //sārī// and //śaṅkha.// That is Indian conception of woman having husband.

That is distinction between widow and a woman having husband. Widow will not accept //sārī.// All finished. Vedic culture, widow should finish her life after having the husband. //Saha-gamana. Satī.// Yes.

[break] ...have got enough to preach. People will like it.

**Devotee:**
Yes, I think so. Yes. I think we have enough.

**Prabhupāda:**
They'll like. Enough ingredients to preach. Simply one has to become intelligent how to express. The, what is called, outlines of thought are already there. You read one line, you can speak half an hour. They are so full of meaning---provided you can express the meanings. So we are not reading all the lines. We are going quickly from one //śloka// to another. Otherwise, if we explained each line of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...//

Just like my Guru Mahārāja explained the first //śloka// for three months in Dacca.

[break] ...after this verse, he explained for three months. Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained //ātmārāma-śloka// in sixty-four ways. That is described in //Teachings of Lord Caitanya.// Sixty-four ways.

Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya explained in nine ways. He did not touch on those nine ways. Setting aside those nine ways, personally He explained in sixty-four ways. Formerly such scholars were there, such religious persons were there. Therefore people were happy. What these rascals speak? Now there is Freud's philosophy and Darwin's theory.

**Revatīnandana:**
It's nice, because here people will listen. In India they won't listen, and in America they can't listen; they're so degraded. [laughs] [end]
