====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.2.14 ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[sings //Jaya Rādhā-Mādhava//] [//prema-dhvani//] Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
All glories to Śrī Guru and Gauranga. [devotees offer obeisances]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.//

Text number 14. [leads chanting of verse] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

> tasmād ekena manasā
> bhagavān sātvatāṁ patiḥ
> śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaś ca
> dhyeyaḥ pūjyaś ca nityadā
> [[books:sb:1:2:14|[SB 1.2.14]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
[corrects pronunciation] Ladies? Ladies. Where is Nandarāṇī?

**Devotee:**
She's in the kitchen, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. Go on. Any other lady? That's all. So read the word meaning.

**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of synonyms]

//tasmāt//---therefore; //ekena//---by one; //manasā//---attention of the mind; //bhagavān//---the Personality of Godhead; //sātvatām//---of the devotees; //patiḥ//---protector; //śrotavyaḥ//---is to be heard; //kīrtitavyaḥ//---to be glorified; //ca//---and; //dhyeyaḥ//---to be remembered; //pūjyaḥ//---to be worshiped; //ca//---and; //nityadā//---constantly.

[12:03]

Translation: "Therefore devotees should constantly hear about, glorify, remember and worship the Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān, who is their protector."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm. So //tasmāt. Tasmāt,// "therefore." It is continuation of the last verse. What was the last verse?

> ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā
> varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ
> svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya
> saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam
> [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]

Everyone should know how to become perfect. That education is not there. They do not know what is perfection. They do not know that "I am eternal. My struggle for existence is for perfection of life, to come to my original Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so that I may regain again my eternal, blissful life of knowledge." That is the aim.

So it is required, therefore, that the social system should be organized in such a way that automatically people become interested in the ultimate goal of life. That is civilization. This is not civilization, simply animal propensities: eat voraciously and sleep twenty hours and have sex life without any restriction, and have atom bomb for defense[?]. That's all, finished, civilization. //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca sāmānyam etat.// These things are there in the animals.

Just like goats. We have seen goats eating twenty-four hours. Not only goats; they..., all other animals. Even if he is strong animal, that, they are... I told you, //na hi suptasya siṁhasya praviśanti mukhe mṛgāḥ// [//Hitopadeśa//]. //Suptasya,// sleeping lion. Lion is very powerful; he is given the honor of becoming the king of the animals. But still, he has to work for eating. It is not that because he is lion he will be sleeping, and some animal will come and enter into his mouth. No. That is not possible. He has to work.

Similarly, everyone has to work. Therefore there must be systematic work so that whole society may develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the ideal or the goal of life. Without program working... Just like I was hearing in Japan they are very much..., the people are very much liking for working, but by law they are being prohibited: "Don't work." So this civilization has been created that they do not know anything more. They are not taught that working is not our main business. Our main business is, as it is stated, //hari-toṣaṇam. Saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. We have to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, or God, whatever you say. But they do not know what is God.

So "There is no God. There is no life." These things are being taught throughout the whole world. You... Cāṇakya... What is...? That Cārvāka theory. Cārvāka theory is that,

> ṛṇaṁ kṛtvā ghṛtaṁ pibet
> yāvaj jīvet sukhaṁ jīvet

and

> bhasmī-bhūtasya dehasya
> kutaḥ punar āgamano bhavet

//Bhasmī-bhūtasya dehasya.// In India, according to Vedic system, the body is burned after death. They are not so foolish to stock and occupy millions of square yards. No. Body is finished; just burn it, finish. Why stock it in a tomb and occupy so much space? Practical, you see. So //bhasmī-bhūtasya dehasya. Bhasmī-bhūtasya// means the body being burned, it becomes ashes.

So actually, the ultimate form or format of this body are three: either you become stool or you become ash or you become earth. Those who are burying underground, after few years the body will become earth. And those who are throwing on the street or on the water, so that body will become stool. Because if you throw on land, some jackals and some animals, some vultures, they will come and eat, and by after eating, it will be stool.

So either ashes or stool or earth. This is the last stage of this body. And we are taking of this stool, ash and earth so much without caring for the real vital force which moving the body. We are very much careful for ash, stool and earth, not careful of the living force which is moving this body, beautiful body. This body is beautiful, very attractive, very important, so long that spiritual spark is there. Otherwise it is stool, ash and earth. They do not know this.

So this requires intelligence. That intelligence is divided into this //varṇāśrama-dharma.// There must be intelligent class of men, //brāhmaṇa.// They are called intelligent class of men. //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. The society must be divided into four classes for cooperation---I have explained yesterday. So at the present moment, two classes are wanting: the //brāhmaṇa// class and the //kṣatriya// class. The //vaiśya// class and the //śūdra// class and less than //śūdra// class are there. Because in the Kali-yuga, it is stated, //kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ. Kalau,// in this age, most, major portion of the population will be //śūdras. Śūdras// means fourth-class men.

Fourth-class men means //śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam.// What is that? //Paricaryātmakaṁ karmam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. Just like dog. A dog, unless it has got a nice master, it is street dog. A street dog. It has no value. Anyone can kill, and it has no shelter, loitering in the street. So //śūdra// means dog's position. If he does not get a nice master, then he's street dog. In spite of high education---M.A., Ph.D., D.A.C, and this and that---if he does not get any employment, he's street dog. What is his value? Eh? "Oh, I have studied high technical education." But if you do not get a service for using your education, then you are a street dog. Is it not? Everyone is searching after some service, service, service. So this service attitude means //śūdra. Paricaryātmakaṁ karma śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]].

In the //śāstras,// therefore, it is said that the //brāhmaṇas,// even there is some difficult time... Just like nowadays, at the present moment, we are creating //brāhmaṇas,// but people do not much like us. They do not care for us. "What is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, their street...?" They are thinking they are beggars. But they are the most intelligent class, //brāhmaṇas.// They do not honor. So this Kali-yuga, actual intelligent class of men has no honor. A third-class man, fourth-class man, fifth-class man has got honor if he gets some money. That is the system of Kali-yuga. Somehow or other, you gather money and you are fifth-class, tenth-class man---you will be honored. This is Kali-yuga. Not for your qualification, but because you have got money you are honored. This is going on.

So //kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.// At the present moment, 99%, .9... 99.9, they are //śūdras.// Therefore the society is chaotic condition. Therefore in your country, you are the richest country in the world, you are producing hippies, frustration, confusion. Chaotic condition. And if you continue this, then you'll lose all your opportunities. Artificially, you cannot remain opulent for many days. There were so many empires---Roman Empire, British Empire, Moghul Empire. These were artificial.

If you systematically follow the Vedic principles as it is ordered by Kṛṣṇa... //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. You must divide the society according to quality and work, four classes of men: //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// And less than //śūdra,// they are neglected.

Not neglected; they are incorrigible. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice, even those who are incorrigible, they can be devotee. That is mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā
> ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ
> ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ
> śudhyanti prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ
> [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]

This movement is so strong that even the fifth class, sixth class... After //śūdra,// then fifth class, sixth class, go on, unlimited. Only the upper four classes are counted to be really civilized organization. Otherwise, there are so many divisions of... So, but if the upper four classes are in right order... The same example can be... If your upper portion of the body, the head and the hands, you can protect, you can fight. But if the upper portion is cut off, your head is cut off, your hands are cut off, then no more fighting. You fall down. Is it not?

So they do not know this science. They're killing the upper portion, the //brāhmaṇa// class, the //kṣatriya// class. Formerly, the //kṣatriya// class, they were being trained. Just like I am now writing notes on //Bhāgavatam,// the four princes. They were to be given in charge of the kingdom. Before giving charge, they were sent for austerity. And they met Lord Śiva, and Lord Śiva gave them instruction, and for ten thousand of years within water standing, they underwent austerity. Then they came back and took charge of the kingdom. This is //kṣatriya.//

Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. Dhruva Mahārāja, at the age of five years old, he left his father's home, went to the forest, and with determination he saw God, Kṛṣṇa, within six months. But after coming back, when he was older, when he became king, oh, he was so powerful that there was some mischief done by the sons of Kuvera, he killed them like anything. You see? He killed them like anything, so that the Kuvera personally requested that "Mahārāja Dhruva, I know that they are criminals, you are doing your duty as king, but I request... Otherwise my whole dynasty will be finished."

So immediately, Dhruva Mahārāja accepted a great man's request, Kuvera. And this Kuvera being so satisfied by the behavior of Dhruva Mahārāja that he was prepared to give him any benediction: "My dear king, you can ask me, from me, any benediction you like. You have kept my request." So what Dhruva Mahārāja asked him? He was Kuvera. Kuvera means the treasurer of the demigods. If he wanted that "The whole treasury of the universe should be given to me," he would have given him. But what he asked? He asked, "My dear sir, you are so kind, you are prepared to give me all benediction. Please give me this benediction, so that I may be attached to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa."

This is //kṣatriya.// If required, they'll fight and finish the whole opposite party. Otherwise they are devotees. Just like Arjuna. Arjuna, a //kṣatriya.// Not that Arjuna was coward. He was sympathetic: "Kṛṣṇa, what is the use of this fighting? The other party, all my relatives, if I kill them, then what do I gain?" Actually, that is the fact. We work so hard, accumulate money for showing to our relatives, to our friends: "Now, just see how I have become rich." But if they are all gone, then "Whom shall I show this kingdom?" thinking like ordinary worldly man.

But he was not a coward. Not that he was hesitating to fight, but when he understood that "Kṛṣṇa wants this fighting. Oh, that's all right." Then Kṛṣṇa asked him, "My dear Arjuna, what is your decision?" "Yes." //Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]: "Yes, I shall fight." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. "Kṛṣṇa wants this fighting. I do not want. I have nothing to... What is my value? Kṛṣṇa wants it. That is value." This is //kṣatriya.// So finished---the whole grandfather and grandchildren and everything, finished. The other party, Kauravas, not a single person lived. So this is //kṣatriya.//

And //brāhmaṇa,// giving direction. All the //kṣatriya,// kings, were taking direction from highly learned sages and //brāhmaṇas...// Just like Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja. So these two classes are now wanted. Here is stated, //cātur-varṇyam...,// eh, //varṇāśrama, varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ.// Otherwise, this present human civilization is dead. There must be these two classes of men: //brāhmaṇa// and //kṣatriya. Śūdras// and //vaiśyas// are there. There are so many shopkeepers and workers and laborers. There is sufficient number. Now there is no //brāhmaṇa// and //kṣatriya.//

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to give some benediction to the whole human society. It is not a sectarian so-called religion, sentiment. No. It is a scientific movement. Scientific movement... If you say, "Why you are interested to save the human society?" That is Kṛṣṇa's business. Kṛṣṇa wants, God wants, that "All these living entities, they should come back home, back to Godhead. Why they are suffering?" Therefore Kṛṣṇa comes personally.

> paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ
> vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām
> dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya
> sambhavāmi yuge yuge
> [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]

Kṛṣṇa is very anxious. We are suffering here, rotting here. We are sons of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa does not like to see that we shall rot here. He wants, "Come back home, dance with Me, eat with Me." But these rascals will not go. They will stick here: "No, sir. It is very good here. I shall become hog and eat stool. That is very pleasant." So this is position.

Therefore, because we are Kṛṣṇa conscious, we are servants of God, therefore it is our duty to save this human civilization. You see? Kṛṣṇa wants it. And to save this human civilization, these two classes are required very urgently. So you American boys and girls, you are intelligent, you have got all facilities. At least in your country create these two classes, //brāhmaṇa// and //kṣatriya.//

The world will be saved, and you will be saved, and Kṛṣṇa will be pleased. //Brāhmaṇa's// business means that people should know what is God, what is our relationship with Him. That is //brāhmaṇa's...// And //kṣatriya's// business is to give protection to the people so that they may all know what is God. That is //kṣatriya's...// And //vaiśya's// business is to provide food for them, production. And //śūdra's// is to help all these three classes by their labor. This is social organization.

It is not that everyone will become //brāhmaṇa// or everyone will become //kṣat...// No. At the present moment, the Communists are trying, "Everyone should be Communist." That is not possible. You cannot make everyone of the same class. No. That is not possible. You have to use your intelligence in such a way that these four division can work cooperatively and become perfect.

And that is suggested here, //svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. That common platform means how to please Kṛṣṇa. Never mind you are //brāhmaṇa,// you are //kṣatriya,// you are //vaiśya.// But so long we are in the material world, there must be four divisions. The //kṣatriyas// should give protection; otherwise the demons will disturb. So there is necessity of war with the demons, for //kṣatriya.// So these three classes are required, //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya,// to give protection. And as soon as the social system is organized, the perfectional point is to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Lord.

Therefore in the next verse it is said, //tasmād bhārata... Tasmād ekena manasā bhagavān sātvatāṁ patiḥ, śrotavyaḥ.// How you can satisfy God if you do not know God, if you manufacture God? //Śrotavya:// hear about God, what is God. Don't become nonsense, accept a rascal as God. There is meaning of God, what is God. Not a dog is God. //Śrotavya. Śrotavya// and //kīrtitavyaś ca.// And spread that knowledge. Just like you are hearing about God. Now you have to spread it. //Kīrtitavyaś ca.// Not that "Oh, I have known God. That's all right. Let me be satisfied." No, you must preach. That is another business.

Because people are ignorant. They do not know what is God; they are manufacturing God. They're accepting some rascal as God. So what is real God, you must preach. //Śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaś ca, dhyeyaḥ.// And you should always think of God; then you will get intelligence. If you think of something else, for sense gratification, then it will not be done. Formally, for simply a show, that "I am devotee"---no. //Dhyeya.// Always thinking of God, always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. //Dhyeyaḥ pūjyaś ca,// and offering worship, just like we have got this in the temple. Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, that is //dhyeya;// and //pūjyaś ca,// and offering worship to the Lord.

So preaching, hearing, always thinking of, and worshiping. These four things are required. Then everything will be all right. It is not official business, that after one week you go, and "God give us our daily bread" and go home. No. //Nityadā,// twenty-four hours, we should be business, engaged in this business. //Nityadā.// What is the meaning of //nityadā?//

**Devotees:**
"Constantly."

**Prabhupāda:**
Constantly. //Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]. That is required. Life should be molded in such a way that not for a single moment you are without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is real life. That is perfection. Because you have to make your life perfect by satisfying Kṛṣṇa, satisfying God. //Saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]], if you want perfection. But if you want again to become cats and dogs, which you have already passed through and now you have come to this human form of body, then you do whatever you like.

But if you want to make this life perfect, stop this business of becoming repeatedly cats and dogs and trees and this and that, then this is the process: //tasmād bhārata. Ekena manasā:// concentrating fully. //Ekena.// With one attention. No diversion. //Ekena manasā, bhagavān sātvatāṁ patiḥ.// Don't be afraid that "If I simply concentrate my mind in Kṛṣṇa, then how other things will go on?" No. //Bhagavān sātvatāṁ patiḥ.// He is very careful about His devotee.

Kṛṣṇa, God, is giving everyone's food, but that is according to //karma,// according to his quality and position. He's getting food. Just like hog is getting food, but he cannot get more than stool. He cannot claim, "Give me //halavā.//" No, that's not possible. You must eat stool. Because you are, by your //karma,// you have got this body, hog, you must eat stool.

So those who are under the //karma,// under the principles of nature's law---that is //karma,// nature's law---they are different. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. Those who are ordinary living entities, they are being carried away by pull; they are being pulled by the ear by nature's law. But those who are devotee, their position is different. They are under the special attention of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

He therefore declares, //kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]: "My dear Arjuna, you can declare to the world that anyone who is My pure devotee, he'll never be vanquished. I shall take care." Why He is asking Arjuna to declare? Because a devotee's attempt is never baffled. That is Kṛṣṇa's desire. Even His own declaration may be sometimes false, but if a devotee declares, Kṛṣṇa will see, it must be done. It must be done.

Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu. He was given benediction by a devotee, Lord Brahmā. He tactfully got so many benediction: "I shall not die in this way, I shall not die in this way, I shall not..." But Kṛṣṇa saw that "This rascal has created some complication. How to kill him?" So keep the words of the devotee, Lord Brahmā, He did not touch all the conditions proposed by Hiraṇyakaśipu. He did something else and killed him.

He wanted that "I shall not be killed by man, by animal." "All right." Then Nṛsiṁha-deva is neither man nor animal. He wanted, "I shall not be killed in daytime or night." "All right." He was killed in the evening, which is neither day nor night. He wanted that "I shall not be killed on land, on water, on air." "All right." He was killed on the lap.

This is God. But you may be very intelligent to trick with God, but God is still more intelligent to, I mean to say, cut down all your tricks, and He must put you into death. //Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]. That you cannot avoid. If you..., you say there is no God, God will come at the time of your death. Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu; he did not believe in God, but God came, "Yes, here is God. You see now what is God."

So before meeting God in that way, the best thing is to see God always within the heart. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. Those who have got developed God consciousness, he is always seeing God within heart. That should be practiced.

Thank you very much.
