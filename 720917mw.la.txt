**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
They are thinking all the oil will be finished.

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all right it will be finished but when it was not introduced...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...this gasoline and gas and what other energies?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Just gas and oil... Petroleum.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. When it is introduced, the gas and oil energies?

**Devotee:**
It was started to be introduced about a hundred years ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee (2):**
No it wasn’t really much used then.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No they cannot trust completely the history of origins of the minerals.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] I mean to say when there was no energy, just like gasoline, petroleum.

**Karāndhara:**
They have been using coal for hundreds of years but then the oil [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Say hundreds of years, so before that how the world was existing?

**Karāndhara:**
Well they say it was existing in a primitive state.

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all right, you go to primitive state and be steady, why do you artificially try to come to so-called civilised state?

**Karāndhara:**
They have two plans for the future then one is, the first one is.

**Prabhupāda:**
No our point is the more you make plans you become.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
More entangled?

**Prabhupāda:**
More entangled that is our point.

**Śyāmasundara:**
The next plan is to harness the atomic energy but there is one constraining factor there and that would be the waste. Atomic energy pollutes the atmosphere.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that means you will create another problem.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Problems yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So your business is to create problems.

**Śyāmasundara:**
They say that that will last about another fifty years before the atmosphere is too contaminated, they will use it all by then and they’re hoping by then they will have harnessed the sunshine, solar energy.

**Prabhupāda:**
One after another.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
But why they do not think either you call primitive state or whatever it is, what do you mean by primitive state? From the Vedic history we can understand that they were flying in the sky with a city, how this energy was produced?

Just like Kapila’s father Kardama Muni he created a city to fly in the sky. Not this 747 but many hundreds of 747’s combined together and not only that with that plane he visited all the planets, all the planets. So how it was produced?

**Śyāmasundara:**
[indistinct] oil for that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Oil.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna.

[break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
The thing is the scientists are worried about is that if they do not start planning now then there will be a decrease in material prosperity and then there is a cultural time lag, before if this. I don’t know how to explain it. In other words by the time the social consciousness gets around to solving the problem the problem is already too great to solve. There’s a fine smog.

**Devotee (2):**
[indistinct] Eh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
It’s like a smog, just like a smog. By the time they get around to trying to solve it the problem is already too great to solve. So they are trying to look ahead enough to solve the problem before it gets large. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is a perpetual struggle against the laws of nature.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is perpetual struggle against the laws. The more you try to become so-called civilised and revolt against the laws of God the more you become implicated. That is called struggle for existence. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]].

**Karāndhara:**
...Irresponsible they had to use a tractor to clean the beach.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Karāndhara:**
They’re so irresponsible they have to use this tractor every day to clean the beach. The tractor makes so much smoke it pollutes the air.

[break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They are less than primitive, uncivilised. Then what is the production of these hippies they are less than primitive. Unclean, misbehaved, everything. Primitive persons they used to cover their private parts with a pearl top with the skin of tree. Now they are trying to be naked. So who is better the primitive or the so-called civilised? Even the primitive Africans they also cover and now they are advanced in civilisation by nudism. [indistinct]. They have no problem.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Eh?

**Prabhupāda:**
Although the Pacific Ocean is trying to cover they are not afraid.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
You see because they are living on nature.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
One of the great defects in the... In modern science is that when they try to find out something.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another problem.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Suppose if they find something like DDT for example. They did not know, they do not know what is going to happen in the future so that makes a great problem later on because they do not know the effects is going to be. So now after using so many years now they’re going to abandon DDT.

I mean they have already abandoned in this country because it produces so many bad effects later on. So they always say that the scientific discoveries advance so fast that the social and economic conditions. The poor people the sociologists and these social workers or common people understand the result.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is already stated in the //Bhāgavata; kṣayāya jagato 'hitāḥ// [[books:bg:16:9|[Bg. 16.9]]]. These rascals they flourish at the risk of making mischief to the world, that is already stated, //kṣayāya jagato 'hitāḥ.// To diminish the duration of life and making mischief to the world. This is their business and they think this is //māyā,// they are thinking they are advanced.

They do not know that they are creating a mischief to the world, //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]] //duṣkṛtinaḥ// the mischief mongers will never surrender to Kṛṣṇa. They make their...manufacture some concoctions and create catastrophe. Therefore they are called demons they do not create something which is very peaceful to the living condition. Simply they disturb... [break] after... [loud engine] Asuric civilisation, demoniac civilisation it disturbs.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Ah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Their first proposition is, there is no creator //anīśvaram.// The word is used //anīśvaram,// there is no God, there is no creator, //pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca na vidur āsurāḥ janā// [[books:bg:16:7|[Bg. 16.7]]]. They do not know how to conduct life what are does, what are doesn’ts, do not’s. They do not know, //pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca na vidur āsurāḥ janā. Jagad āhur anīśvaram// [[books:bg:16:8|[Bg. 16.8]]], //jagad āhur// this creation is without any controller this is the first beginning. [break].

Real knowledge //Bhagavad-gītā,// read //Bhagavad-gītā// thoroughly you get complete knowledge. //Yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo 'nyaj jñātavyam avaśiṣyate// [[books:bg:7:2|[Bg. 7.2]]], //anyat jñātavyam// anything more to be known. If one reads //Bhagavad-gītā// carefully his complete knowledge is there. Hare Krishna. Aeroplanes are described but these planes are not being driven by machine or this petrol, why do they not make research? How they were flying their planes?

**Karāndhara:**
Their main area of investigation is sunshine, solar energy they are trying to harness the sunshine.

**Prabhupāda:**
They might have been using the solar energy which is unlimited.

**Karāndhara:**
They are hoping that [indistinct] one of their theories is if they can reverse magnetic influence, polarise different[?] magnetic fields they’ll have flying saucers that will fly simply by reversing magnetism.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes they are [indistinct] without any [indistinct] not only [indistinct] used to go any planet they like in big big aeroplanes. Kardama Muni’s aeroplane, just like there was lakes also, gardens also, palaces altogether they could fly. The Sun’s energy is utilised by these planets because they are floating under Sun’s [indistinct]. They do not know they say law of gravity.

**Karāndhara:**
If you have a small bell.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes I’ve seen it.

**Karāndhara:**
If you put it in the sunshine it [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. Actually these planets are floating on Sun’s energy.

[break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
Without feathers they cannot fly.

**Karāndhara:**
They die in that case.

[break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
Black oil [indistinct]...

**Karāndhara:**
When the tide goes back bubbles come up from holes crabs are hiding...bubbles...[indistinct].

[break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They know how to mate and they know how to defend as soon as we are coming they are going away. So this eating sleeping mating and defending is there even. [end]
