How many minutes?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
I don’t know I left my watch.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
I left the stopwatch down in my office. We will find it when we listen and play it back.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
I have a real quartz watch. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//deho, geho, jo kichu mor. mānasa, deho, geho, jo kichu mor.//

This is a song sung by Bhaktivinode Ṭhākur. He is teaching the process of full surrender. //Mānasa, deho, geho, jo kichu mor.//

First of all, he is surrendering the mind, because mind is the origin of all kinds of speculations; and surrendering, rendering devotional service means first controlling the mind. Therefore he says //mānasa,// means "mind," then //deha:// "senses." //Śarīra. Deha// means this body; body means senses. So, if we surrender the mind unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then automatically the senses also become surrendered.

Then, "my home." //Deha, geho. Geho// means home. //Jo kichu mor.// Our all possessions are comprising these three things: mind, body and our home. So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura proposes to surrender everything. //Arpilū tuwā pade, nanda-kiśor.//

//Nanda-kiśor// is Kṛṣṇa. So "I am surrendering my mind, my body and my home unto You."

Now, //sampade vipade, jīvane-maraṇe:// "Either I am in happiness or I am in distress, either I am in living condition or I am dead."

//Dāy mama gelā, tuwā o-pada baraṇe://" Now I am relieved. I am feeling relief because I have surrendered unto You everything."

//Mārobi rākhobi-jo icchā tohārā:// "Now it is up to You whether You like to keep me or You want to kill me; that depends on You."

//Nitya-dāsa prati tuwā adhikārā:// "You have got every right to do whatever You think right in relation with Your servant. I am Your eternal servant."

//Janmāobi moe icchā jadi tor:// "If you so desire"---because a devotee goes back to Home, goes back to Godhead---therefore Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura proposes, "If You like that I shall again take birth, it doesn't matter."

//Bhakta-gṛhe jani janma hau mor:// "That's only request is that if I have to take my birth, please kindly give me the chance of taking my birth in a devotee's house."

//Kīṭa-janma hau jathā tuwā dās:// "I don't mind if I am born as an insect, but I must be in the house of a devotee."

//Bahir mukha brahma-janme nāhi āś:// "I do not like nondevotee life. Even if I am born as a Lord Brahmā. I want to remain with the devotees."

//Bhukti-mukti-spṛhā vihīna je bhakta:// "I want such devotee who doesn't care for material happiness or spiritual liberation."

//Labhaite tāko saṅga anurakta:// "I simply desire to be associated with such pure devotees."

//Janaka jananī, dayita, tanay:// "Now, henceforward You are my father, You are my brother, You are my daughter, You are my son, You are my Lord, You are my spiritual master, You are my husband, everything You are."

//Bhakativinoda kohe, śuno kāna:// "My Lord, Kāna---Kṛṣṇa, You are the Lover of Rādhārānī, but You are my life and soul, kindly give me protection."
