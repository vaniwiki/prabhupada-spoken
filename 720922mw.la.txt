====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...believes that "I am //kṛṣṇa-dāsa,//" all trouble. //Jīv kṛṣṇa-dās, ei viśvās korle to' ār duḥkho nāi// [Gītāvalī]. [//japa//] [break]

[on walk]

**Prabhupāda:**
...scientist, Dr. [indistinct].

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He is from India. [indistinct] University. Your department is university?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. University of California, Irvine. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...do you know anything about law of relativity?

**Devotee:**
Force and reaction? No, I'm not... I left school when I was very young. I studied on my own.

**Prabhupāda:**
Law of relativity, just explain what is that.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Everything in this material world is all relative. Nothing is absolute. For example, time and space, these are all relative terms; there is nothing absolute. That means something is bigger than something. If you compare two things, like small ball and the big ball, the big ball is big enough compared with the small one. Same thing, if you compare the length of certain pole, that length will be relative to a certain standard. So everything is related.

**Prabhupāda:**
So on the strength of law of relativity, you have to express God.

**Devotee:**
So far I have only experienced how this material world is relative.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee:**
And God is absolute.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. God is only absolute. Everything relative. God is great; that is absolute. Otherwise anything, it is great or...small, small.

**Devotee:**
Because compared to Him, everything is very small.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Absolute, means there must be relative also.

**Devotee:**
The devotees, they want to [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah?

**Devotee:**
They want to personally [indistinct] distribute the literature. And they came to our house for //prasādam// a number of times.

**Prabhupāda:**
Some devotees?

**Devotee:**
Yes. [indistinct] Los Angeles. They went on a tour.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Devotee:**
The devotees. And they came for //prasādam...// [break] [end]
