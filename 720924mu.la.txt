**Karāndhara:**
Yes. //Karatālas// are in the room?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

[//mṛdaṅga// plays, followed by //karatālas//] [tapping sound]

One two three.

**Devotee:**
One?

**Prabhupāda:**
One two three. Yes. So. Permanent, you follow?

[//mṛdaṅga// plays, followed by //karatālas//]

[//mṛdaṅga// plays, followed by //karatālas//].

One two three, then one two, one two and three.

[//mṛdaṅga// plays, followed by //karatālas//] .

That’s not good..

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? No.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply one two [indistinct].

[29.01]

Well that’s all right.

**Devotee:**
I just don’t get it.

**Devotees:**
[laughter] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...from inside they bring [indistinct]. A small child and he cannot restrain? A small...

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is nature’s way. Take care of the child immediately. When boys are spoiled? Simply by bad association, that’s all. The world is so much polluted any innocent child can be polluted. That is going on everywhere all over the world. The whole world is polluted even the best child is polluted. When? As soon as he goes to school and meets his friends, finished. The schools, colleges are slaughterhouses. [break]

[30:56] [purport]

//Nitāi guṇa-maṇi āmār nitāi guṇa-maṇi//---this is a song sung by Locana Dāsa Ṭhākura, almost a contemporary of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He has got many books on the life and precepts of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So he is saying that Lord Nityānanda is full of good qualities, //guṇa-maṇi.//

//Guṇa-maṇi// means the jewel of all qualities. So //nitāi guṇa-maṇi āmār nitāi guṇa-maṇi.// He is repeatedly uttering that Lord Nityānanda is the reservoir of all good qualities. //Āniyā premera vanyā bhāsāilo avanī.// And on account of His spiritual qualities, he inundated the whole world by the flood of love of God. It is by His kindness people can feel what is love of God. //Premer vanyā loiyā nitāi āilā gauḍa-deśe.// When Caitanya Mahāprabhu left home and took //sannyas,// He made His headquarter at Jagannātha Purī. So after His accepting the //sannyas// order, when He left His home and country Lord Nityānanda Prabhu also accompanied Him up to Jagannātha Purī.

So after a few days, Lord Caitanya requested Him that "If both of us remain here, then who will preach in Bengal?" Bengal is known as //gauḍa-deśe.// So under the order of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He brought from Him the flood of love of Godhead and He distributed in the whole of Bengal, //gauḍa-deśe.// And in that flood of love of God, all devotees became drowned. Only those who were not devotees, they could not drown but they were floating, //dīna hīna bāche.// But so far Nityānanda Prabhu is concerned, He does not make any discrimination between devotees and nondevotees. //Dīna hīna patita pāmara nāhi bāche.//

Poor or rich or enlightened or foolish, everyone could take the instruction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and become drowned in the ocean of love of Godhead. Such love of Godhead is //brahmār durlabha.// Even Lord Brahmā, who is the supreme teacher within this universe, he also cannot relish. But by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Mahāprabhu, this love of Godhead was distributed to everyone without any discrimination.

So //ābaddha karuṇā-sindhu,// it was just like a big ocean blocked all sides. Ocean of love of Godhead is a big ocean, but it was not inundated. So Nityānanda Prabhu cut a canal from the ocean, and He brought the canal in every door. //Ghare ghare bule prema-amiyāra bān.// The flood of the nectar of love of Godhead was thus distributed in each and every home in Bengal. Actually still Bengal is overwhelmed when there is talk of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu.

//Locan bole,// now the author is speaking on his behalf that anyone who does not take the advantage given by Lord Nityānanda Prabhu, so in his opinion he thinks that such a person knowingly is committing suicide. [end]
