**Prabhupāda:**
//Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yogino.// [SB 12.13.1] This is //jñāna.// The leader of the meditation that Viṣṇu-devānanda.

**Karāndhara:**
This is the Maharishi.

**Prabhupāda:**
No he is also one of the meditation leaders and now he is being sued for having illicit sex philosophy but the leader is being sued for sex, so what the nonsense will do?.. Another rascal is being sued that Sac-cid-ānanda?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh Sac-cid-ānanda..

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
He is ‘The Divine Light Society’ or?

**Karāndhara:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
What [indistinct] going to say? All these meditation //wālās// they meditate upon women that is all.

**Karāndhara:**
They don’t know what the meaning of transcendental is. They have no teacher. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just on the line you will see all these different types of [indistinct] break] Hare Krsna.

[chanting //japa//]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We see every day in the morning the waves are working the laws of nature are working constantly without any stopping [laughs]. [break]

**Karāndhara:**
Prabhupāda in London you initiated [indistinct] sister [indistinct] one Līlā-śakti and another one, they are all sisters you initiated her.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Karāndhara:**
She’s a teacher in Sweden she is learning to teach children 5 to 7 years old. Well she went back to Sweden to finish her teaching.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Karāndhara:**
Then she is being married to one of the boys in London, in any case she was telling us that in Sweden about five years ago [indistinct] then when they began school and then when it ended [indistinct] now they have taken that out and they are teaching Marx, Marxism.

Because the Socialists the Socialists are [indistinct] she went back to Britain she wears a //sārī// because she is teaching children she can show them different cultures by wearing //sārīs// [indistinct] influence her, but then they let Marx in.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why you are influencing me? They are influencing her, they cannot do that and she cannot do that. That means [indistinct]. They are teaching the girl not to influence the children but they are influencing the girl. Why they are influencing? If you don’t like influencing others why you are influencing me? [break]

You have to keep the same radius, the parabola is not the same radius.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then how you can make parabola? The circle anywhere you can go---the same radius... [break] ...there is social worker, there is political worker, there is philosophical worker in this way in this way you can make hundreds and thousands of circles keeping in the centre Kṛṣṇa, everyone is perfect.

That is the instruction of //Bhāgavata; avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam// [[books:sb:1:5:22|[SB 1.5.22]]]. That I repeatedly said, just like you are a scientist you explain Kṛṣṇa by scientific language, so among the scientists’ Kṛṣṇa will be appreciated. If you...

Because after all they are rascals, so if they hear some scientific technological word in connection with Kṛṣṇa then they will believe it... All these medical journals simply they put some medical vox populus and may convince the user, "oh, it is a very scientific [indistinct]."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
The layman does not know what it is but when it is explained in scientific language, that’s all. //yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam, idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥśrutasya vā, śrutasya, śrutasya// means education. So by your education you just describe the quality, the greatness of the Lord, //yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam// and that is the perfection of your education.

Just like we explain Kṛṣṇa quoting some verses from //Bhagavad-gītā// or //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// similarly if you explain Kṛṣṇa quoting some scientific authority it will [indistinct] the scientists. So everyone has got his line of activities, so within that subject...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
...try to glorify Kṛṣṇa then your education is perfect, //yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam.// Just like in Sweden, they are now trying to glorify Marx, they do not know...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
...whom to glorify.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So they are missing the centre?

**Prabhupāda:**
They are missing the centre. We, we say to the communists that, "here is spiritual communism." You are making your state centre we are making Kṛṣṇa centre, that’s all. You’re making the state as proprietor of everything we are making Kṛṣṇa as the proprietor of everything. What is the difference? But here you will find perfection.

You say that everyone in the country should be prosperous, we say that even a leader at your home should be given //prasādam,// even a snake at your home he should be fed. Where is your that philosophy? You don’t care for the animals you simply care for the man and animals are being slaughtered, where is your perfection of communists?

If you want everyone should be happy why the animal should be unhappy? They are also creatures of your country they are born there, so where is your perfection? It is simply nonsense. But if you make Kṛṣṇa con... Centre then we love animals man insect everyone equally. Here is perfection.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
This is a very perfect example.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It’s so nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes nobody can have perfection without making Kṛṣṇa centre, //yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam.// Why do you discriminate that the cows are to be killed and human being is to eat.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why do you cries if someone stronger kills you. The poor animals they cannot make any protest, you are killing, similarly a strong man if he kills you why he should be accused? That is the law, might is right then why do you protest against a man who is aggressive? Might is right that’s all. But the real thing is right is might, right is Kṛṣṇa. [break].

Any other subject except here, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This communists are expanding their philosophy in other countries, why do they not make perfect in their own country?

**Devotee:**
Well even amongst, even amongst communists there is a constant clash between.

**Prabhupāda:**
There must be there because it is imperfect.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anything you put imperfect you will never satisfy everyone.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Karāndhara:**
The Chinese they criticise the Russians, the Russians criticise the... Swedish

**Prabhupāda:**
Chinese.

**Karāndhara:**
The Swedish criticise the Yugoslavians.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where is your perfection of communism?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
The same thing as other politics are doing now.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So missing that central point the living entities then fall down in this 8,400,000 species of cycle.

**Prabhupāda:**
This 8,400,000 cycle means everyone is interested in his own sense gratification and our philosophy is Kṛṣṇa’s sense gratification

[break]. Looked after the central source, here is central source all [indistinct] //mayi sūtre sūtre gaṇā//[?] [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]], //mayi...// But ah //śloka.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Is that from //Bhagavad-gītā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That the all pearls they are ah.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Threaded?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, threaded in one place, this thread is the central.

[break] and we want to save them.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Laughs] Those chemical research is dragged them to the darkest regions of hell. Let them finish their all humbug, all philosophers all scientists all politicians if they want to save them, otherwise let them go to hell, what can be done? Can you not openly declare?

**Karāndhara:**
Yes we can.

**Prabhupāda:**
Stop this nonsense if you want to save yourself.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Come here and chant Hare Krishna.

**Devotee:**
//Jaya.//

[chanting //japa//]

**Prabhupāda:**
It has to act within the limit.

**Karāndhara:**
Eh?

**Prabhupāda:**
They are working day and night fools and hoofs, but within the limit, so everyone has got some limit, even the vast ocean, what to speak of these teeny scientists. Limited that is called conditioned, so far---no more, that’s all. So all these scientists, research work so far no more.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are starting to realise that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The physical scientists, physical. The scientists in the physical sciences, plus they are realising that they are realising that their limit is this now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Because there is no more research to be done. Those who did are sending out to biological sciences. Now already a new field is coming up mostly biological sciences.

**Prabhupāda:**
What?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Their, their...

**Prabhupāda:**
Their biological sciences can they study the insects? What is the biological constitution of the insects?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yeah they are going to study that with microscopes by a...

**Karāndhara:**
Some of them say, some physicists.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Karāndhara:**
They say that they have already, they have studied everything there is to study about physics, they know everything they don’t have to study any more.

**Prabhupāda:**
We’ll prepare one insect in the laboratory.

**Karāndhara:**
[indistinct] studied all the physical laws.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Karāndhara:**
And they have observed the phenomena [indistinct] control them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well not only controlling, they commit always mistake that was simply mistake. There are expecting some result and it is coming from [indistinct] not accurately. Same process adopted but still it is not accurate.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In fact most scientific discoverers they welcome the mistakes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Laughs]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Laughs] Because they say that because of the mistakes they get something new later on. Right for example when penicillin was discovered, some years ago, the scientist was working, Fleming. Alexander Fleming he did not know anything about penicillin because he was just making a culture in the bacterial solution, culture, and somehow he saw some spores where there was no bacteria growing.

Then, but his aim was to... Not to find penicillin but to do something else but something happened which he did not know. Then later on it was discovered that it was penicillin. Like that most scientific discoveries are accidental.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They do not aim something they aim something particular but they do not get it. They got something wrong, something mistake so they say always scientific discoveries are always accompanied with mistakes. But ultimately they say the mistakes they welcome the mistakes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we have mistakenly taken to Kṛṣṇa, welcome.

**Karāndhara:**
They welcome mistakes because their intelligence is so small they can’t figure any, they can’t figure it out for themselves but by chance or by Kṛṣṇa’s arrangement they stumble on it.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] they have no engagement on the solid platform [break] [indistinct]. They wanted to dominate over the material nature.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
God has given them... Created the material world and he has given us chance, "all right enjoy here," because in the spiritual world there cannot be anyone’s enjoyed, all servants. So anyone who wants to enjoy, to become master, he is sent here. "All right..."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So Kṛṣṇa is so kind that if somebody wants to do something.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
He gives the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Chance. That is chance. That chance is beyond his calculation. That chance is not his creation, that chance is created by Kṛṣṇa. [break] [indistinct] become later. [break]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Like in India the Indigo was formerly supplied from India all over the world. Then during the Second World War the supply was cut off, so they started making synthetic dyes imitating indigo colour and ultimately they found that they can make cheaper...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They can make cheaper by just synthesising. Not from the natural source. That’s why it was replaced by... that is why India has no market in the later on about the indigo dye.

**Prabhupāda:**
All the indigo factories closed after the [indistinct] color. And they made it composed of... [break]

**Devotee:**
Whatever is lying on the bottom [break] Agra. [break].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They have two heads one is white one is brown. The white one is very soft and tender.

**Karāndhara:**
Five minutes to seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh? Why you become [indistinct]

**Devotee:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Walk a little faster.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm? This is fast?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It’s fast now. Walking a little faster now.

**Karāndhara:**
Yeah [indistinct].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yeah. [end]
