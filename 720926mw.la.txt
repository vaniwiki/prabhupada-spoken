**Prabhupāda:**
Where is my overcoat? I thought you were bringing it. [indistinct]

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
...takes care of the cow and gets the milk so out of the milk he makes //ghee,// so the richer section will pay this //ghee,// he gets some money and from the cow dung he gets fuel.

**Devotee:**
Fuel.

**Prabhupāda:**
And while churning the //ghee// the buttermilk is used by him with //capātī// it is very nice.

**Devotee:**
Do you only eat //capātīs?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh yes we don’t require anybody’s bread simply we prepare //capātīs// and with the buttermilk with a little salt and chilli, oh it is very nice. So he has no problems.

**Devotee:**
Just from one cow?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes simply by keeping one cow his livelihood is [indistinct]. [break]

**Karandhara:**
[indistinct] a little field [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
The scientist, [indistinct]?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
What? [laughs] trees and the flowers grow from a seed?

**Karandhara:**
[indistinct] from a seed how does that happen?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the chemical composition? Do it.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, in order to germinate it’s... Normally the.embryo the living forces inside sleeping inside the seed so when under favourable conditions.

**Prabhupāda:**
They will find something which they cannot explain.

**Devotee:**
Yes [laughs].

**Prabhupāda:**
The scientist means ultimately they will find something which they cannot explain.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then their responsibility is finished, "something is sleeping," that’s all.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[laughs] so they say the embryo.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the use of consulting, what is their thing from sleeping?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Something. [laughs]

**Karandhara:**
Yeah that’s the question.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is their foolishness, you go to them they will manufacture some bombastic word and they will say, "now it is sleeping, [indistinct] stopped."

**Devotees:**
[laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]. Go to a doctor some disease he explains some fungus this that some so many... you cannot understand, you see? Neither he understands. Just like I was in the drug business. So instead of writing water they say //aqua distilata,// you see, so that the patient may not know.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Understand [laughs].

**Prabhupāda:**
Because if the patient sees water [laughs] he’ll say, "I am paying fees for water?---And this rascal is giving me."

**Devotees:**
[laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like //aqua distilata,// this is not. Never allowed. That is their business.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Kṛṣṇa says in //Bhagavad-gītā,// "I am the seed giving father," so seed is coming from Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you accept Kṛṣṇa. Why do you try to explain from their nonsense ideas? [laughter]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So they make experiments in the... In the botanic laboratory how a plant comes out from the seed so they [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Even up to millions of generations they will never be able to find out what is that. Simply waste their time and take money from the government and live very comfortably.

**Devotees:**
[laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Nice payment. What do you think?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] All rogues and thieves, yes. The whole world is a society of cheaters and cheated. To ordinary man also the so-called agitated---if you say, "Kṛṣṇa is cause of the sea."Then, "Ah this is all imagination---science says like this." But he does not understand what is science.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So if the scientists understands that the living force inside the seed is Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa’s energy. Then he will immediately forget his speculative... eh concept.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes...

[break] they will say, "yes we are trying in future we shall find out."

**Devotee:**
Just a few more years.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In the meantime they will die.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
And ah... [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Before finding out Kṛṣṇa will take them away, to become void.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] [break].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In Vṛndāvana every... all the birds and everybody is singing about the glories of Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. A seed like mustard seed contains a big banyan tree.

**Devotee:**
Banyan tree in which form?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? You’ve seen banyan fruit, a fig?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, it’s very small.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very, very small seed and each seed contains a big tree. How it is potentially kept there? Let the scientists explain.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Just like the... ah sesame, the sesame seed.

**Devotee:**
Sesame seed?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes they are that big, about that size.

**Prabhupāda:**
No it is smaller than sesame seeds. And such a big tree and millions of figs and within the figs millions of seeds, potency.

They are kept... potency. This is the potency of Kṛṣṇa.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I’ve seen inside the fig, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that small fig.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There were so many small small insects.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
When we opened it---it just came out flying---all over.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah yes, from insect flies come and from the flies birds come, this is the...

**Karandhara:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere there is living being and these rascals say that the moon planet there is no living being. How we can believe?

**Devotee:**
There was a meeting a few weeks ago and they sent some space probe to Venus.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes?

**Devotee:**
And it’s the Russians.

**Prabhupāda:**
What? First of all develop this moon they have left it.

**Devotee:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see they are childish, childish, he is playing with something and then [indistinct].

**Devotees:**
[laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply rascals! And the government is rascal and paying them.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They find a useful [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
How this grass is coming? Nobody has given there seeds how it is coming? Unless there was seed. So within this stone cliff there was seed.

**Devotee:**
//Jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
You see it is coming and no gardener is employed there and it is coming. Not only that, big big temple in India mosque.stone, as soon as there is little crack, vegetation coming.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There are some plants Śrīla Prabhupāda which do not give flowers and that so they do not give fruits in the... In the general sense but they can be... There may be... You can cut one of the branches and put it in the soil and they will grow.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Does that mean that the seed is inside the plant inside the branch?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes potencial.

**Devotee:**
Because the seed contains Kṛṣṇa’s potential energy. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is Kṛṣṇa’s energy one energy He has given that the material energy is given start then from material energy so many varieties of life is come out.

[break] //vividhaiva śrūyate,// and it will come out so nicely, anyone will appreciate there is a big brain, //svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca,// one can appreciate in this plan there is a very planning brain.

**Devotee:**
It’s so beautiful, it is magical.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything these are the Vedic, //parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]. //Svābhāvikī,// just like flower is coming, so the painting the colour the display the symmetries is so nice that it requires a very nice painter, artist to draw that. But it is coming out by the potency of Kṛṣṇa, //svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.// The knowledge is working perfectly, everything, where is that science?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There is no question that huh... there should be no doubt about this but the...

**Prabhupāda:**
But they are so rascals they will not agree.

**Devotee:**
Otherwise it is in studying plants and flowers [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Neither do they know how many plants and flowers are there.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Nowadays they are also crossbreeding from one plant to... with another and so they change the... Some of the internal structure of the purist... For example the orange it can be mixed...

**Prabhupāda:**
But that is not difficult, mix with somebody... Something else then it becomes another thing composition, that is your chemistry. But originally how things are coming that is the question.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not that mixing, mixing anyone can do what is the necessity of a scientist any gardener can do. They are making experiments, what is this experiment? [indistinct]?

Simply bluff. What a child can do they are doing in the name of scientific research. What is the use? There are so many, 2 million varieties of plants, suppose by mixing them you make another two or three.

**Devotees:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
What is your credit? Just see the fun, they can simply bluff foolishly, that is all.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They just want to play some games.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Just to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Childish just like children are prone to play, this thing that thing that thing that and ultimately breaker it. One sense childish that’s all. [break] Done nothing real problem you cannot check death, you cannot check birth, you cannot check old age and you cannot check disease.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So the most important fundamental questions are left over. Without huh...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They do not touch it.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because it is beyond their [indistinct]. What is difficult task, they have left it at that [laughs] and they are now mixing with one plant to another with a child can play.

**Devotee:**
The government, I once asked the government that I’d like to do research about what happens after the time of death.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
But the government would give no money.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
I summoned once the government.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Devotee:**
I summoned... I want the research about what happens after the time of death.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Devotee:**
The government would not give anybody money for that research. They think, "What is this?"waste of time [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no need of research it is all explained in the Vedic literature.

**Devotee:**
[laughs]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Is it not also the mercy of Kṛṣṇa Śrīla Prabhupāda that people tend to forget about Kṛṣṇa? Is it a mercy or...

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not mercy it is punishment.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That the living entities...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān// [[books:bg:16:19|[Bg. 16.19]]] that is explained..

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
This...

**Prabhupāda:**
Those envious persons they are put into such condition of life...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
...that they will never be able to understand what is God, that is punishment.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā// and without knowing God he will have to transmigrate from different types of body sometimes like big tree, sometimes ant, sometimes dog, sometimes man, sometimes tiger this is required---fate. All these conditioned soul’s within this material world they are that way suffering.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Just [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like they are driving this car they are thinking, "oh I have got a car. This is //māyā.// I’ve got a car I can..." Even he is meeting accident, he is still he is thinking, "oh yes I’ve got a good car." He does not know that the good car is for his death. Not only that they are killing so many animals on the road, ants and some other big animals they are killing at least small ants they are killing but they are becoming responsible for killing those small animals.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] hostility for ever escaping from the cycle of life [indistinct] pure devotee.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Well it is by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is mercy.

**Devotee:**
Otherwise they would never be able to explain [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, simply indulge, //loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]], //karma-bandhanaḥ// this is the word used, //yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ.//

**Devotee:**
//Karma-bandhanah// means [indistinct] activities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, bound up by the laws of material nature. [indistinct]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm. [break]

**Devotee:**
The doctors say that [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
Sometimes infections the germs are attacking the body. [indistinct] various tiny germs are attacking the body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Devotee:**
Is that really what is taking place---germs are attacking the body? [indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Āyurvedic// principles, the germ is not attack. When you go... When you develop a certain type of disease the germs grows and disease becomes visible when your internal function are not in order. The example is just like if you make a place filthy you’ll find so many germs in place.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...not the germs are coming and make it filthy.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Well the germs are already there but they find a suitable food in to grow in a...

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like in a bed, bed bugs they do not come outside you keep your bed unclean and you perspire by contact the bugs will come.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So the conclusion is germs do not attack but if you make the condition favourable the germs will grow. They do not know hygienic principles the doctors, they do not advise their patients hygienic principles. The germs are growing, they are seeing that, "oh the germs are infecting." That is another foolishness.

**Devotee:**
The disease is due that nothing is clean?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah yes. Therefore in the Western countries so many diseases.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is very very unclean. In India you won’t find so many diseases. They take... Use sufficient water---three times taking bath, washing their cloth, washing the floor everything hygienic, cleaning it.

**Devotee:**
Then the germs won’t come there?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. As soon as you keep things unclean, you’ll find cockroaches, this germ that germ. But if you keep very clean everything, flies cockroaches they will not come.

[Car doors closing]

//aśaucam neti carācarāḥna vidhu asritah bhūtana//[?], so they are keeping these dogs eh? So that is another source of growing so many germs disease.

**Devotee:**
Dogs.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they keep the dog on the bed.

**Devotee:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Their best friend [laughs].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In our home we are not allowed to touch the dog.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Or outside the house.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes the dog cannot enter in the house, [indistinct], what to speak of... he must [indistinct].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The medical doctors say that inside the body there is a white blood corpuscles are the defensive mechanisms so when some germ develops they say the white blood corpuscles is not good enough or is not enough to defend the coming germs. So that is why the disease attacks.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes they will say something because you have [indistinct], to satisfy you, and you have to be satisfied because you cannot [indistinct].

**Devotee:**
If you ask them they say they do not know, we do not have the patience.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But the common people believe these things, everybody that’s why the...

**Prabhupāda:**
The common people are rascals. They are called //śūdras, śūdra// means rascal less intelligent. //Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ,// everyone is born a //śūdra// he [indistinct]. We are introducing this reformatory method to make them into //brāhmaṇas.// Otherwise everyone is //śūdra.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Everyone in this country Śrīla Prabhupāda there is, there is some sort of health insurance. Some sort of health insurance, almost everybody so that means they put some money.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. To pay the doctors and hospital care, hospitalisation. Because they know that their science will not be able to keep them healthy, in spite of all talks by the scientists he has to be assured of his treatment by paying money.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But nobody came to save my money.

**Prabhupāda:**
At least they think like that. If money is my [indistinct] if you have got money then you have everything. Money means a few scrap paper that’s all. That is also another cheating, I am paying you a $100 it is just scraps of paper [indistinct], "oh I’ve got big amount [indistinct]" but that is not dollar that’s paper. And it is understood that in exchange of this paper you can get gold but you’ll never get gold. That is a permanent cheating.

**Devotee:**
Now the government admits that they will not have enough gold to cover the amount of money. It used to be that they had to keep a reserved [indistinct] they said they had it reserved [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
This way?

**Devotee:**
Enough gold [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Is it not?

**Devotee:**
Either we go to Venice or what is that Regent Street. Regent Street?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh yes you can Kardiya... Cardiff.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
I think that will be shorter.

**Devotee:**
Oh yes. [end]
