[15.16]

**Prabhupāda:**
How many minutes?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Ah. 14 minutes 45 seconds. I started the watch right when we began playing about a minute before you actually began singing. [break]

[harmonium briefly plays]

[//mṛdaṅga// tunes up]

[//karatālas// joins //mṛdaṅga//]

[//mṛdaṅga//]

[//karatālas// joins //mṛdaṅga//]

[20:46]

**Prabhupāda:**
Sing only harmonium.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
You don’t hear anything else?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

[//mṛdaṅga//]

[//karatālas// joins //mṛdaṅga//]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śuddha-bhakata-caraṇa-reṇu bhajana-anukūla...//

[37.23]

//Śuddha-bhakata-caraṇa-reṇu, bhajana-anukūla.// This is a song, sung by Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura in pursuance of Prahlāda Mahārāja’s instructions in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Prahlāda Mahārāja has recommended, eh. //Naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghrim// [[books:sb:7:5:32|[SB 7.5.32]]] "one cannot have pure devotional attachment to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord." //Naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghrim, spṛśaty anarthāpagamo yad-arthaḥ,// "by touching the lotus feet of a pure devotee means immediately all misconceptions of life becomes eradicated."

//Naiṣāṁ matis tāvad urukramāṅghrim, spṛśaty anarthāpagamo yad-arthaḥ, mahīyasāṁ pāda-rajo-'bhiṣekaṁ. Mahīyasām,// "those who are great souls, great devotees who accept the dust of their lotus feet." //Niṣkiñcanānāṁ na vṛṇīta yāvat,// "unless one comes to that point it is very different to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

Actually it is not possible, one cannot make any advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness unless he accepts the dust of the lotus feet of the pure devotees. So Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura says that "the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotees is very favourable for advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

//Śuddha-bhakata-caraṇa-reṇu, bhajana-anukūla,// "it is very favourable." //Bhakata-sevā parama-siddhi prema-latikāra mūla,// "the love of Godhead is always compared with a creeper as the creeper in the garden takes the shelter of another big tree." Similarly when we approach a pure devotee and engage ourselves in the service of that pure devotee that is our shelter exactly like the creeper takes shelter of a big tree.

//Prema-latikāra, prema-latikāra,// "the creeper of love stands in that position." //Mādhava-tithi// "and after that following the instructions of the pure devotee," means "//mādhava-tithi.//" Just like Ekādaśī. Ekādaśī is called //mādhava-tithi// or Janmāṣṭamī any festival in connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called //mādhava-tithi.//

//Mādhava-tithi bhakti-jananī,// "if we observe the performance of //mādhava-tithi// then that becomes the mother of our devotional service." //Bhakti-jananī jetane pālana kori,// "one has to observe this //mādhava-tithi// very carefully."

//Kṛṣṇa-basati basati boli' parama ādare bori,// "and //kṛṣṇa-basati,// or Kṛṣṇa’s place just like Vṛndāvana, Mathurā, Dvārakā they are famous as being Kṛṣṇa’s favourites, so to live in such holy place one should be very much hankering after, //kṛṣṇa-basati.//"

//Gaur āmāra je-saba sthāne koralo bhramaṇa raṅge,// "similarly Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has travelled many places in India, //ye-saba sthāne.// So one should be very much eager to see those places." //Gaur āmāra, je-saba sthāne koralo bhramaṇa raṅge,// "wherever he has travelled."

//Se-saba sthāna, heribo āmi praṇayi-bhakata-saṅge,// "I want to see those places which in company with a pure devotee." If ordinarily anyone goes to such places he will see only the street and the trees and the cars and the, but the same place when it is visited along with a devotee it has got a different effect.

//Mṛdaṅga-bādya śunite mana abasara sadā jāce,// "I wish to hear the sound vibration of //mṛdaṅga, kohl,// it is very pleasing to me."

//Gaura-bihita kīrtana śuni'ānande hṛdoya nāce,// "and when I hear some song which is approved by the disciplic succession of Caitanya Mahāprabhu then my heart dances with that song."

//Jugala-mūrti dekhiyā mora parama-ānanda hoya,// the deities there, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, when I see. I feel transcendental pleasure.

//Prasāda-sebā korite hoya sakala prapañca jaya,// "and when I take, respect the //prasādam// offered to Kṛṣṇa then I think that I am becoming liberated," actually it is so. The more we eat ordinary foodstuff we become entangled. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that, //yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ// [[books:bg:3:13|[Bg. 3.13]]]. "One who eats //prasādam// he becomes free from all contamination of life."

Whereas one who cooks for himself, generally people do so, generally the mass of people they purchase things, so many uneatable things, meats, fish eggs along with vegetables also. But they eat only sins, sinful life there but if you eat //prasādam// you become free from sin and if you do not eat //prasādam// you cook ordinary things for your eating then you become entangled instead.

//Je-dina gṛhe bhajana dekhi gṛhete goloka bhāya,// "whenever I see at home there is worship of the Lord I think the, my household life is as good as Vaikuṇṭha."

//Caraṇa-sīdhu dekhiyā gaṅgāsukha nā sīmā pāya,// "and whenever I see the Ganges," because the Ganges is emanating from the toe’s of Lord Viṣṇu "therefore I become highly pleased, ecstatic by seeing the Ganges River."

//Tulasī dekhi' jurāya prāṇa,// "and similarly whenever I see the Tulasī plant." //Mādhava-toṣaṇī jāni',// "because I know that by offering Tulasī---Kṛṣṇa is very much pleased therefore as soon as I see a Tulasī plant I become very much ecstatic."

//Gaura-priya śāka-sevane jīvana sārthaka māni,// "similarly when I eat //śāka,//" green vegetable which is very dear to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "I feel that my life is now successful."

//Bhakativinoda kṛṣṇa-bhajane anakūla pāya jāhā,// Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura, Bhaktivinode Ṭhākura says that "whatever I feel favourable in the matter of executing my devotional service unto the Supreme Lord every day."

//Prati-dibase parama-sukhe swīkāra koroye tāhā,// "I accept all of them every day with great pleasure."

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Nine, nine minutes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. 14 and 9.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Almost 15. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Almost 24. [end]
