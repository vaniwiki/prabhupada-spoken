**Prabhupāda:**
Door-to-door storekeeper just to subsist because he had no other means he could not get any good employment but he was nice scientist Dr. of Science or Mr. Mitra. But what could be done? Anyway somehow. So he was manufacturing some household soap not very good quality but still on cycle he was going from shop to shop.

That any common man can do but was see educated to become a Dr. of Science for that purpose? But why he was doing? Necessity has no law. So therefore, //daridra-doṣo guṇa-rāśir nāśī// [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita], if you become poor even though you have got many good qualities.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody will care for you.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody will care for you. You may.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
What is the...

**Prabhupāda:**
...be a Dr. of Science you may very big, very big in so many qualities but especially in this age Kali-yuga unless you have got money all these qualities are useless.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes that is probably true everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is always true therefore Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has said, //sarva-śūnyā daridratā, vidyā hīnaṁ jīvanam,// if one is not educated then his life is spoiled. //Vidyā hīnaṁ jīvanaṁśūnyam.// I have seen one of my friends son’s he was brilliant scholar he appeared for medical MD examination and one day he went to see his professor and he said immediately that, "you go and take rest," and by telephone he said to his brother that his heart is very weak, he may die at any moment take care of him and in the evening he died. And next day or after two days the result came out that he has passed the examination. So, //putra-hīnaṁ. vidyā hīnaṁ jīvanaṁśūnyam.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
If one is not educated his life is spoiled then //vidyā hīnaṁ jīvanaṁśūnyam. diśaḥśūnyā deha abāndhavāḥ.// You are going to some unknown place if there is no friend and because in India they go to pilgrimage---famous temple so if there is no famous temple of God or no friend that city may be very big city but it is void for you.

So that just if somebody comes into Los Angeles city without any friend without... then it is very difficult. It is... Although the city is so nice for him it is void. //Diśaḥśūnyā deha abāndhavāḥ, putra-hīnaṁ gṛhaṁśūnyam,// married life without son it is also void and //sarva-śūnyā daridratā// and in spite of all these things if one is poor then everything is void.

**Devotee:**
Yes, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Cāṇakya Paṇḍita?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? So people are especially in this age no one will care you if you have no money. Nobody will care.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That’s why on the material platform all suffer because they don’t have no money, so everybody suffers.

**Prabhupāda:**
No there is money but if you want fabulous money that money is not there. Otherwise for your subsistence there is money there. But you’re not satisfied so that money.

**Jayatīrtha:**
No one is satisfied just with subsistence in the material world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

Jayatīrtha: They want to lord it over the material world.

**Prabhupāda:**
He wants to compete, "oh he has got so much money I must have like that," therefore struggle.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Not even these people who have a lot of money even they are not satisfied.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is a fact but still I am trying to imitate that man.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is my foolishness. I know that, that man is not satisfied even if I go to that point I will never be satisfied, that’s a fact but still he tries, "oh he has got millions I have got only thousands," this is the..

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes. There was one man Howard Hughes he was the richest man in the world, billions of dollars and always when reading about him.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
He was hiding...

**Jayatīrtha:**
He was divorced, he was hiding in this place or that place and seeing a psychologist, a psychologist, and everyone is trying to become like Howard Hughes. He owned a big aircraft company and so many things but still he was not satisfied.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is trying to be happy so he sees that this is not suitable let me go to that stage, let me go to that stage, let me go to that stage in this way stage after stage he is going---migration that is called migr---transmigration. But he is not happy, he cannot be happy in this way. Do the scientists know this?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
If the scientists know this then the world would be all nice because.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore they are foolish they have no perfect knowledge.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are leading the common people at the moment so if some of them come out and then eh.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are not leading they are misleading, don’t say leader. They are bluffing.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are leading in the wrong direction.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes if you do not know the things are there you must be in wrong direction. That is cheating not leading that is cheating.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
You do not know what is actually the aim but you are leading that is cheating.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Hm.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So one way to stop this is the followers they know that the scientists are cheaters so if they know that they are cheaters they’ll not follow.

**Prabhupāda:**
No we want to be cheated, this is the disease, he wants to be cheated otherwise why does he go to so many rascals as //avatāra?// God’s //avatāra,// he has no sense he wants to be cheated that God has created common sense so [indistinct] what is this nonsense I am accepting as God? That means he wants to be cheated, therefore cheater is there. If you want to be cheated then how you can avoid cheater?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has no common sense that a boy of 14 years, having a imitation helmet. And he the rascal. What class of men they are, anyone can study, fourth class tenth class men but there are fourth class tenth class men all over the world they want to be cheated. First-class men how many there are? Only fourth class tenth class men, //śūdras.// [break] who can protect you from being cheated?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So the will of the individual is granted.

**Prabhupāda:**
The will of individual that has to be purified that is our //saṅkīrtana// movement, chant Hare Krishna and simply if he passively hears he will be purified. Then he will understand that this is the movement. [break] sometimes they ask that if you do not approve of this improvement then why do you take advantage of this..

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Roads [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Radio or microscope and microphone and aeroplane why? They ask us.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes they ask many times like that yes they ask me also.

**Prabhupāda:**
So the rascal does not know that if I do not take advantage then your scientific discovery will have no place. Suppose you have discovered aeroplane if public do not use it then what is the value of your discovery? We are giving you mercy.

**Devotees:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Rascal, aeroplane if you don’t fly an aeroplane then how you will make money? We are showing you mercy that this poor fellow has discovered let us give them some mercy.

**Jayatīrtha:**
So [laughs].

**Prabhupāda:**
And a common third-class man he is riding on an aeroplane and I shall not ride? But apart from that point of view, if I don’t ride, if everyone does not ride on your aeroplane then where is the value of your discovery? If there is no customer to purchase your commodity then where is the value of your commodity?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
One of their. One of the answers. Of the why they discover they say, "because it arises the necessity of the need for doing something else."

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all right but the discovery of aeroplane does not mean that you have mitigated all the sufferings of the human society.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rather you have increased for maintaining the aeroplane it is an extra energy just like these tractors. Like in Indian villages they took it first of all and as soon as there was some trouble they rejected. I have seen so many tractors are lying idle, for there is no facility in the village to get the mobilised the petroleum then the machine goes bad, no repairers so out of disappointment they reject it.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Hm, they go back to their ox. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
When we ride on board an aeroplane we know that we are riding on danger.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes at every moment.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Every moment.

**Prabhupāda:**
Every moment.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
200 men 300 men can immediately be crushed, so your discovery of this is not a facility it is also danger.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So they fail to see that point all the time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They see that there is a danger for doing something else also they think good all the time in terms of...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no everything has good and bad side that is the material world. Similarly without aeroplane at least I haven’t got to risk my life. That is the good side, as you have got good side similarly without aeroplane there is good side.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now people have got aeroplane they are risking life but when there was no aeroplane there was no risking of life that is the good side.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So the scientists when the moment comes that there is nothing that we can do about when they come to realise that the Supreme Being is controlling all these phenomena then they’ll.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is side-ism[?], our philosophy is that by the supreme friend everything is complete there is no necessity but we human beings given the better facility for understanding the supreme friend we are utilising that for temporary eating sleeping mating that’s all. Like the animals that means by such so-called scientific advancement we are misusing our friend.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Wasting our time and our lives.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because we cannot make any solution of the suffering, it is a fact suffering is there even if you manufacture aeroplane the suffering is there. Danger is there so danger is not mitigated but you increase another type of suffering that’s all.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Advancements are made in order to progress economic development. Increasing commerce.

**Prabhupāda:**
Economic development what is that economic development? Eating sleeping mating.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So without such economic development other 8 million species of life they are existing.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes [laughs].

**Prabhupāda:**
We are only 400,000 human species and others they are 8 million, so without any institution of economic development how they are living? They are rather free, chanting[?] nicely //tiky tiky tiky tiky.//

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have no anxiety. [break] everyone is trying to be happy so from that standard of point of view science has not made people happy that’s not a fact. Neither they know what is the ultimate objective of happiness... What is this?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
What is the what is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Boat[?]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That the men are holding?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Some stick[?] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The discovery of this carrier means both up-and-down you cannot have peace simply //gurg gurg gurg gurg gurg gurg gurg gurg.// Even in the remote village //gurg gurg gurg gurg gurg gurg gurg gurg.// They don’t want the disturbance.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That’s why they are studying research on noise pollution to control the noise.

**Prabhupāda:**
Another research?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Creating one disadvantage and then another research, then another disadvantage, another research.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is called //punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]], chewing the chewed.

**Jayatīrtha:**
That is one worry they have that the noise level is becoming dangerous.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayatīrtha:**
They think that the noise level.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Is becoming dangerous.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is dangerous. It is dangerous. If you can manage disease. I feel this noise is very dangerous, for mines personal mine[?] I don’t like this noise. Everywhere you go some sound, //gurg gurg gurg gurg brrrrrrr.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In Switzerland near the airport the jets makes such terrible noise when they are about to take off, so noisy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Always you have come here for peaceful atmosphere but it is not possible.

**Jayatīrtha:**
It is attractive.

**Devotee:**
On the beach there is a tractor.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
When we go on the beach in the morning there is the tractor. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
When we come to know that this material platform is nothing but a platform of suffering.

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all. This is our conclusion our conclusion we take from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. It is a place for suffering and that is also temporary you cannot make adjustment, "all right, it is all right Sir we shall just remain here for good."

That also will not be allowed, kicked out, "now leave this place," "no, no I am going," "just become a pigeon," you cannot check your science, as soon as natures kicks you that if you give up this human body you become a pigeon or become a tree immediately. What is your science will do?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Their Ph.D.’s and MA’s will be.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Finished. By nature’s kick everything finished.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁśaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]] this is the right... [break]

**Devotee:**
Dressing rooms.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Dressing rooms?

**Devotee:**
Dressing rooms.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
What is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
What...

**Devotee:**
Making a movie

**Jayatīrtha:**
They’re probably going to take some movie here.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh.

**Jayatīrtha:**
They are bringing portable units, for dressing and so on... Yes...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Most families here they have mobile homes Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
//ācchā.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They drive with the car and they.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have seen them.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[In the car] it is growing to that extent. Just like football. [indistinct]

**Jayatīrtha:**
Ah. [indistinct] limit.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee:**
Is that how it goes back into the body of Mahā-Viṣṇu?

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like football becomes [indistinct]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Jayatīrtha:**
Sometimes [indistinct] again.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The scientists also say that the universe is expanding.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the nature just like your body, my body we came from a seed [indistinct] limit of expansion, again finished. There are so many examples, just like the boys play with soap bombs.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes soap bubbles.

**Prabhupāda:**
Soap bubbles, yes it is expanding and popped.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is like that.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa says this is, //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// and we are seeing experiencing every day but why should we spoil our lives by making adjustment in this popped universe. It will be popped and all arrangements, everyone knows. Such a nice city of Los Angeles there is no guarantee within a second you can be inundated.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Go within the womb of this ocean.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes. You can get any kind of insurance on a building here in Los Angeles but the only kind. It’s so expensive no one can afford it. Is earthquake insurance, hardly anyone will write earthquake insurance because there is such a fear that the earthquake will come at any time and nobody wants to gamble their money on someone else in the building and it will not fall apart in the earthquake. The threefold miseries are always attacking, no one can avoid them. [indistinct] also had one question.. Someone sent some dust from the.

**Prabhupāda:**
We go this way?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Is this the way?

**Prabhupāda:**
Someone sent some dust from the //bhajana-kuṭira// of the Gosvāmīs in Vṛndāvana and he was wondering whether it could be put on the altar in some little glass box? On [indistinct] altar.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Jayatīrtha:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Altar is the seat of the Supreme Personality of Godhead the devotees dust cannot go there.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Oh.

**Devotee:**
[Chanting //japa//] [pause] [break] [end]
