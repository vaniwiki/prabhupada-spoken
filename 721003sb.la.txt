[11:36]

Translation: "All of the above-mentioned incarnations are either plenary portions or portions of the plenary portions of the Lord, but Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead. All of them appear on planets whenever there is a disturbance created by the atheists. The Lord incarnates to protect the theists."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. This is confirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā://

> yadā yadā hi dharmasya
> glānir bhavati bhārata
> abhyutthānam adharmasya
> tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham

So everything is property of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So this material world is also the property of Kṛṣṇa. Because here the people do not care for Kṛṣṇa, that does not mean that it is not the property of Kṛṣṇa. Just like in the prison, within the prison walls, the prisoners, they say, "We don't care for the government."

They say like that. But it does not mean that the prison house does not belong to the government. It is government property. But these rascals, they are being forced to live in the prison house, and still they say, "We don't care for the government." This is rascaldom. You are under my control, and as soon as you are in wrong, I am kicking you on your face, still, if you say, "I don't care for you..." You can say that. But there is force, that you say, "Don't care," but I force you. You have to care.

This is material world. They are saying, "Don't... There is no God. We don't care for God. We are, everyone, God." But //māyā,// the police force, is there, kicking on the face. And they are subjected to so many tribulations, miserable conditions of life, especially birth, death, old age and disease. Now you don't care for God. So why don't you stop your death? You stop your death. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś ca aham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]: "To the rascals and the demons, I am death. I take away everything." //Sarva-haraḥ.//

//Sarva-haraḥ// means these rascals are trying to possess so many things: cars, motorcars, skyscraper building, bank balance, big family, big friends, big empire, and so many things. But when death comes, he cannot protect himself, what to speak of protecting other things. You see? So he's under full control, the demons. And every moment, he's under control.

Suppose I have got money. I can eat so much. But as soon as you eat little more, immediately you are under control; you cannot eat for three days. Indigestion, immediately. And still, the rascal says that "I am not controlled." If there is little pain here, he immediately becomes: "Where is doctor? Where is doctor? Where is doctor?" And still he says, "I'm not controlled," and "I am God."

He does not know what is the meaning of God. God is never controlled by anyone. That is God. That is the definition of God. If you are God, then why you are being controlled? Because they're rascals, demons, foolishly speaking something nonsense. But we should know that God means controller. He's not controlled. And when God was present on this planet, He showed what kind of God He is. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. Anyone, any demon who tried to imitate God, they were all killed. All killed.

The Kaṁsa, his only policy was to kill Kṛṣṇa. "As soon as Kṛṣṇa comes, kill Him." So many plans he made. He... Kṛṣṇa happened to be his sister's son. So he imprisoned the sister and brother-in-law so that "He may beget children, but in my front. I must remain... As soon as children, child is born, I shall kill."

So this is the policy of the demons. Therefore, //indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. When people become, the inhabitants of all different planets, they become very much perturbed on account of these demonic... In this Kali-yuga especially, the demons are so large in number that people are actually in harassment. Every year, they are presenting taxation bill. And wherefrom the taxation will come? The taxation will come from your pocket and my pocket. They will charge income tax, and the storekeepers will increase the value of commodity. So you have to pay.

So you are..., we are complaining, "Oh, the things are going high price." But why? Because the demons are levying taxes. The... It is not the scarcity of goods. There is sufficient commodity. Sufficient. But they have made a economic plan. Just like in your country, the government said that "You don't produce more." Why? If one can produce... Kṛṣṇa has given food. You have to simply little work and produce your food.

But in order to keep the balance of price, they say, "Don't produce." Why not produce? So many people are, they are... If actually we produce foodstuff in the ordinary way, then we can produce foodstuff so much that ten times of the whole population of the world can be fed. Ten times. There is no question of scarcity or poverty. There is no question. We create. These demons, they create.

You have no experience. I have got experience. Or some of the Indians who are present... In 1942, the government created artificial famine. Artificial famine. The government began to purchase. The poli... That time, the war was going on. So Mr. Churchill's policy was that "Keep the people in scarcity, and they will..., they'll voluntarily come and become soldiers." That was the policy. "You have no money. So..., and the another venue is opened. Yes, you become a soldier. You get so much money." People, out of poverty, would go there. That was the policy.

So this policy was executed that government began to purchase rice and, I mean to say, commodities which are daily necessities. And... Any price, any price they can offer. Because the currency in their hand. They can print the so-called papers, hundred dollars, and pay you, and you becomes satisfied: "Oh, I have got hundred dollars." But it is a piece of paper. The cheating is from the government. Why the people will not learn how to cheat?

So this is going on. This is called demonic. Demon means for their own sense satisfaction, they are prepared to do anything wrong. Just like this Kaṁsa. Kaṁsa, the elder brother of Kṛṣṇa's mother, and as soon as he heard an omen from the sky that "You rascal Kaṁsa, you are taking your brother and sis..., brother-in-law and sister in your chariot to their home in their marriage ceremony, but you, rascal, do not know this sister's son will kill you." "Oh? My sister's son will kill me?" Immediately caught up sister: "Finish my sister."

Vasudeva saw. "What nonsense you are doing? You are such a big king. And your sister, younger sister, and she is married in this auspicious moment. Why you are killing?" "No, she is the cause of my death." Then, "Your sister is not the cause of your death. Her son. That's all right. But I promise, all the sons will be delivered to you." Because it is the husband's duty to give protection. So some way or other, he saved the situation.

So this is the demon. He did not consider that "Here is my poor younger sister. She's just now married. In jubilation she's going at her husband's home. How auspicious ceremony." And he was personally driving the chariot. But as soon as he heard that "Oh, there is danger from my sister," he did not care anything, no relationship, no ceremony, no auspicity, nothing. This is demon. Demon means for his self-interest he can do anything nons..., nonsense. That is demon. And demigod means he'll consider thrice before doing anything.

Just like Arjuna. Arjuna was insulted in so many ways by the other party, his cousin-brothers. His kingdom was taken. They were sent to forest for thirteen years. His wife was insulted. So many things. But still, he was considering, "Whether I shall kill my kinsmen? The other side, they're all my brothers, nephews, brother-in-law. Whether I shall fight and kill them? Kṛṣṇa, I don't wish to kill them. Let them enjoy."

This is demigod. In spite of the other party, aggressor in so many ways, he was thinking. And here you see Kaṁsa, simply for the news that in future his sister's son will kill him, immediately he was prepared to kill his sister. And in the marriage ceremony. This is the distinction between demigod and demon. Just try to understand. A demon has no consideration.

So in this age, Kali-yuga especially, demoniac, everything, demons, godless. Demon means godless. //Indrāri.// Demons means Indra, or //indrasya ari. Ari// means enemy. Indra is demigod. And his enemy, that is demon. //Indrāri.// Just like you are, when you go to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you have got so many enemies. They do not act directly, but they are very much envious: "What these nonsense are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?" You see? They want to disturb. Just like we have to close this door because the demons will disturb. You see?

So demons means enemy of the demigods, enemy of the devotees. Those who are God conscious, those who are abiding by the orders of God, they're demigods. God. Demigods means they're also God, but subordinate to God. They don't say, "I am God. I am completely." No, a Vaiṣṇava will never say so. He knows that "I am eternal servant of God." Therefore demigod. Otherwise, their qualification is godly.

So //indrāri-vyākulam...// Indra. Indra is demigod. He's the king of the demigods. So //indrāri-vyākulam.// When people become very much disturbed by this demonic government and demons... So //dharmasya glāniḥ. Dharmasya glāniḥ// means discrepancies in the matter of executing religious principles. In Kaṁsa's time... Just like in Russia, you cannot chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// What to speak of chanting in the street, you cannot chant even in private. That is their law.

So that law is coming gradually everywhere, godless. In China, I've heard, anyone teaching about God, next life, he'll be shot. Is it not? Somebody said me. Anyone teaching next life and God, he'll be shot down. So your country is still very nice because you are not shooting Kṛṣṇa conscious people, but [chuckles] there is possibility. Demons are increasing. Demons are increasing. But don't be afraid. Kṛṣṇa is there. Just like Kṛṣṇa's mother and father were so much, I mean to say, harassed by Kaṁsa. But at the end, Kaṁsa was killed by Kṛṣṇa.

So we may be harassed for the time being, but Kṛṣṇa will save. This is //śaraṇāgati. Avaśya rakhibe kṛṣṇa viśvāsa pālana.// The //śaraṇāgati// means..., surrender means that "Kṛṣṇa will save me. I, I'll not do anything against the devotional service. Even there is torture..." Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. He was tortured by his father. He had... Kṛṣṇa's mother was tortured by his [her] brother. Not outsider. So the demons are so rascal, they don't care for son, sister, mother. No. "As soon as it is against my personal sense gratification, I must finish this." But be sure that Kṛṣṇa will save.

We have got so many instances. As Prahlāda Mahārāja was saved by Hiraṇyaka..., by Narasiṁhadeva from the hands of his father, Hiraṇyakaśipu; Devakī was saved, Vasudeva was saved from the hands of Kaṁsa; so you will be also saved. Because there is promise in the //Bhagavad-gītā: kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, "Make it a declaration throughout the whole world that anyone who is My devotee, he'll never be annihilated. He'll be protected. I'll give him protection."

//Samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu. Samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo 'sti na priyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:29|[Bg. 9.29]]]. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that "I am equal to everyone. Nobody is My enemy, nobody is My friend." //Ye tu bhajanti māṁ prītyā:// "But those who are devotees, engaged twenty-four hours, I give them special protection. I give them special protection."

So the demons will be there, and they will always give trouble to the demigods, or the devotees. But you don't stop your function, devotional service. Don't be afraid of the demons. //Indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ mṛḍayanti.// This //mṛḍayanti// means "giving protection"? Yes. Give protection.

So this //saṅkīrtana// movement, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, is also incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. //Nāma-rūpe avatāra.// Kṛṣṇa can become incarnation in sound form also. Not even a physical form. Physical form also there; everything is there. But especially this age, Kṛṣṇa is incarnated in His name. The name of Kṛṣṇa is not different from Kṛṣṇa. So //nāma-rūpe kṛṣṇa-avatāra// [[books:cc:adi:17:22|[Cc. Ādi 17.22]]]. So Kṛṣṇa is already there. The whole world is now demonic, anti-govern..., anti-God, anti-matter or anti-God now.

So the incarnation has already come. Those who will take shelter of this incarnation of Kṛṣṇa's name, they will be never annihilated. Take it for granted. Yes. So incarnation. Kṛṣṇa's name and Kṛṣṇa, no difference. That is omnipotency. Omnipotency. Omnipotency means everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy. So the same potency in the energy and the energetic.

This is omnipotency. God is omnipotent; He can give you protection when you take shelter of His name, because His name is nondifferent from Him. //Abhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:133|[Cc. Madhya 17.133]]]. //Nāma-kṛṣṇa. Nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaḥ, pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto 'bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ.//

Don't think this Kṛṣṇa's name is less efficient than Kṛṣṇa. No. //Pūrṇa.// As Kṛṣṇa is perfect, similarly, this name is also perfect. //Pūrṇaḥ śuddhaḥ.// As Kṛṣṇa is pure, without any material contamination, //apāpa-viddham,// no..., nothing sin, sinful can affect Him... You have read it in the //Īśopaniṣad.// Just like sunshine.

The infection cannot infect sunshine. Some disease can infect you, me, because we are less potential. But it cannot infect the sun. Rather, the sunshine will sterilize the infection. So anything infectious, anything sinful, cannot infect Kṛṣṇa. Rather, sinful activities in touch with Kṛṣṇa will become purified. This is the process.

There are many instances. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja, you can see. Prahlāda Mahārāja is standing, and his father is being killed before him. This is sinful. Can you tolerate? Suppose if somebody comes to kill me, and you will see and laugh? You'll do? Will you do that? Why? That is sinful. So here Prahlāda Mahārāja is seeing. It is not protesting.

Prahlāda Mahārāja is not protesting, "Why you are killing my father?" No. He's seeing. So why Prahlāda Mahārāja is worshiped? Why he has become a //mahājana,// authority? You can say, "Oh, he's a most sinful. He has seen in his presence his father is being killed, and he did not protest." You can say so. But because it is in connection with Kṛṣṇa, Prahlāda Mahārāja is the most exalted devotee. He's not sinful.

The //gopīs...// The //gopīs,// they were wives, householder's wife, sister, daughter. So they went at dead of night to dance with Kṛṣṇa. This is sinful according to Vedic injunction. No young girl can go to any young boy without being married. That is Vedic injunction. So practically it was sinful. And...

But because it was with Kṛṣṇa, in connection with Kṛṣṇa, they went to dance with Kṛṣṇa, the //gopīs// are worshiped more than any devotee in the world. Caitanya Mahāprabhu... //Gopīs,// exalted. //Ramyā kacid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇā yā kalpitā// [Caitanya-manjusa]. So actually, they did sinful acts, action, by leaving their father, brother or husband and went to Kṛṣṇa at dead of night. They were all young girls. That is, according to Vedic injunction, that is sinful. But they are worshiped.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu, such a big //sannyāsī,// who never allowed any woman to come near to offer respect---He was so strict; they would offer respect from distance---He says, //ramyā kacid upāsanā.// He says that the worship, the method of worship conceived by the //gopīs,// that is..., there is no comparison. //Ramyā kacid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇā yā kalpitā.// Now, He was so much strict about women. Why He is praising the external sinful activities of the //gopīs?// Why? Because it is in connection with Kṛṣṇa.

There are many instances. Just like Bali Mahārāja. Bali Mahārāja gave up the connection with his spiritual master. Why? His spiritual master said, "You don't give to Kṛṣṇa." He was thinking that "If this rascal everything gives to Kṛṣṇa, then how I shall live? I am living at his maintenance." Just like you sometimes give me maintenance, I live. So you stop the maintenance, I shall die.

So he thought like that, that "He's my disciple, and he's going to..., everything to Kṛṣṇa. Then I'll not get my maintenance. Then I shall die." So he stopped him: "Don't give to Kṛṣṇa." But Bali Mahārāja said, "Oh, you are stopping me to give to Kṛṣṇa? I give up your relation. I don't want." He became a //mahājana.// Prahlāda Mahārāja became a //mahājana. Gopīs// became the most worshipable.

So Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that even in the ordinary ways it looks sinful, but if it is actually done for Kṛṣṇa's sake... The same thing, Arjuna. He was thinking that "Killing of my family members, it is sinful." He argued with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore this //Bhagavad-gītā// is there. He was simply arguing that "I'll not fight. I'll not kill my grandfather, my teacher, my brother, my nephews, my brother-in-laws. No, no, I am not going to... It is sinful."

But at the end he did it, because he understood, "Oh, it is for Kṛṣṇa. All right. I shall all..., take the all the risk. That's all right." So as Kṛṣṇa..., the devotee takes all the risk of life, similarly, Kṛṣṇa gives all the protection to the devotee. Don't be afraid. So //indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ mṛḍayanti yuge yuge.// He's always giving protection to the devotees. Don't be afraid.

And another thing is that //ete ca aṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ. Puṁsaḥ// means the person, the Supreme Person. So the Māyāvādī rascals' theory is that the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and when He comes to be present before us as person, He accepts a material body. This is their theory, //māyā,// Māyāvāda, that Kṛṣṇa's body is also bone and skin. That is their theory. They accept, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is God, but He has accepted a body of flesh and bone." This is Māyāvāda theory.

But the //śāstra// does not say. Kṛṣṇa Himself says, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]: "These rascals, they also consider Me like one ordinary human being because I have come here just like human being." He, He has said, //mūḍho ābhijānāti:// "Deride at Me." This is their... To consider Kṛṣṇa's body is made of flesh and bone, that means minimizing the value of Kṛṣṇa. Dr. Radhakrishnan has done it. No.

Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute is, Absolute Truth is always person. //Puṁsaḥ,// here it is said. //Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. The incarnation... When some incarnation comes, He's expansion of the person, not that He accepts this material body. //Ete ca aṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ.// The, all the description of the incarnation have been given before this verse.

So therefore, it is concluding that "All these incarnations, they are expansion of the spiritual body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Not that the Absolute Truth is imperson, and He, He's accepting a form with material body. No. That is not. That is not. Just like here, Deity. He is also expansion, //arcā-vigraha. Arcā-avatāra.// Don't think that it is made of stone or metal. It is expansion of Kṛṣṇa. You want to worship. Kṛṣṇa has expanded Himself to come here to accept your service. Don't think it is made of stone. So //ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]].

So //bhagavān svayam,// the Absolute Truth is Bhagavān. Bhagavān means person, with six opulences. And why He comes? //Indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ mṛḍayanti yuge yuge.// People are harassed by these demons. Therefore He comes to give protection. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. He comes to give protection to the //sādhu.// They are very much anxious to be... When they are in danger, they pray for Kṛṣṇa. So just to satisfy them, Kṛṣṇa comes. Not even for killing the demons.

But when He comes, He also executes this service also, to kill all these demons. Otherwise, for killing demons, He does not require to come. He, He has got many agents. So many demons can be killed within a second. For this purpose, killing purpose, Kṛṣṇa does not come. He comes especially for the devotee, just like Prahlāda Mahārāja.

For give //darśana// personally to Prahlāda Mahārāja---he has suffered in the hands of his father---He appeared. Otherwise, to kill Hiraṇyakaśipu, oh, it is not very big business. //Indrāri-vyākulaṁ loke mṛḍayanti// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. When a devotee is very much harassed, so He comes in..., as incarnation. So you stick to remain a pure devotee, and Kṛṣṇa will give you all protection.

Thank you very much.
