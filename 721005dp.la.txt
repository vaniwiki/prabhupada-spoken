**Prabhupāda:**
[//Govindam// prayers playing; sings along] //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.//

So we are worshiping the original person, Govinda. People are embarrassed to find out the cause of all causes. The scientists, the philosophers, they are embarrassed, the religionists. But we have got information of the original cause:

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

There must be some cause. We do not accept anything as chance. No. There is no chance. There is cause. Everything has got cause. So the original cause is Kṛṣṇa. So our knowledge is perfect therefore. We know the cause. So you chant this //mantra, govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi,// and you will be in full knowledge. //Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavanti// [//Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// 1.3]. In the //Vedānta-sūtra,// Vedic language, it is said, "If you know simply Govinda, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then you know everything. All knowledge is perfect."

So try to understand Kṛṣṇa; then all other categorical knowledge will be revealed. Spiritually, knowledge is revealed. By material senses we try to acquire knowledge, but that is..., always remains imperfect. And if you receive knowledge from the original person, then your knowledge is perfect.

So we have started this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to educate people in perfect knowledge. So we have got so many branches, and we have to travel and encourage them. So now I am going to the eastern hemisphere---from the western hemisphere to the eastern hemisphere. So I am going now in San Francisco. From there, I shall go to Hawaii, and then cross the international line, dividing East and West. Then we go to Manila, and therefrom we shall go to India.

In Vṛndāvana we shall have //Ūrja-vrata// for one month. You also could observe //ūrja-vrata// here from the next Ekādaśī, one month. I have already instructed Karandhara to have a sky lamp and put candle in the evening to the Deity for one month. Each one, a small candle should... And then, after //Ūrja-vrata,// we have a big engagement in Hyderabad. And then in Bombay, then in Delhi. In this way.

So in the meantime, you go on with your work, hold the morning class, //Bhāgavatam.// Each verse try to understand scrutinizingly, and worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, dress very gorgeously. Offer Them //prasādam// very gorgeously, and you take remnants of the foodstuff. So in this way keep yourself fit always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and there will be no chance for //māyā// to attack you.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [devotees offer obeisances] [end]
