**Prabhupāda:**

> ...bhavadbhir loka-maṅgalam
> yat kṛtaḥ kṛṣṇa-sampraśno
> yenātmā suprasīdati
> [[books:sb:1:2:5|[SB 1.2.5]]]

So the sages in the Naimiṣāraṇya, their inquiry was that "After departure of Kṛṣṇa, the principles of religion, under whom they are now protected?" Religious principles should be protected. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa's another name is Dharmasetu: He protects. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. Just like it is the duty of the state, of the government, to give protection to the department of law and order, similarly Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He gives protection to religious principles.

But the world is so deteriorated that Kṛṣṇa comes, He gives protection, makes things in order, leaves His instruction... Just like when Kṛṣṇa came, He personally supervised the religious principles, and practically, He killed so many demons who were against religious principles. Demons means those who are against religious principles. And He left His instruction, //Bhagavad-gītā,// how to follow religious principles.

The sum and substance of religious principle is to surrender to God. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is religion. Religion means the order given by God. That's all. This is the simple definition of religion. If you, anyone asks, "What do you mean by religion?" religion means to abide by the orders of God. That's all. Just like good citizen means who abides by the order of the government. That's all. There is no difficulty to understand what is good citizen. Whatever the government gives you law, and if you follow, then you are a good citizen. Similarly, there is order by God, and anyone who follows that order, he's religious.

Religious does not mean a kind of faith. That English translation of the word //religion// is not sufficient. Faith---"I believe in this, I may not believe in this"---that is different thing. But law means you must. There is no question of you believe or not believe. You believe or not believe, it doesn't matter. Law is law. Suppose there is fire. I believe that "I'll touch the fire; it will not burn," that is not law. It must burn. Even a child catches the fire, it will burn. There is no excuse. Similarly, //dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]].

[aside:] [Hindi] Let him come and sit down.

No, no... [Hindi]

So you cannot violate the laws of God. Any one of us, we know. Just like we, we eat... [Hindi aside] Eating is the law of God. Everyone should eat. But if you eat more, if you violate the law... You can eat whatever you require, little. But if you eat more, if you violate this law, then you'll be diseased, immediately. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. As soon as you violate the laws of God, you'll be punished.

Therefore Sūta Gosvāmī says, //munayaḥ sādhu pṛṣṭo 'haṁ bhavadbhir loka-maṅgalam// [[books:sb:1:2:5|[SB 1.2.5]]]: "You have inquired about Kṛṣṇa. It is a very noble question." //Sādhu. Sādhu// means pious, noble. So if people simply inquire about Kṛṣṇa, what is Kṛṣṇa... Just like we are preaching all over the world to arouse this inquisitiveness about Kṛṣṇa. And actually, that is happening.

Our //Kṛṣṇa// books, wherever we present... Because this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is now spread all over the world, they are very much inquisitive to know about Kṛṣṇa. Our this //Kṛṣṇa// Trilogy is selling anywhere like hotcakes. They're inquisitive now to know about Kṛṣṇa. So this is very good sign. If you... If simply people try to inquire about Kṛṣṇa, day will come he will be liberated. Just like in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said, //kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya, viśvāsa śabde...//

**Devotee:**
//Śraddhā.//

**Prabhupāda:**

> śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya
> kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]]

//Śraddhā,// to advance in spiritual life, the beginning is //śraddhā,// faith. That is faith. //Śraddhā...// Not exactly faith. //Śraddhā// means respectful: "Oh, it is nice." That is called //śraddhā.//

So Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, in front of whom we are now speaking, he gave us the definition how one can make progress in spiritual life. Everyone is blind after material way of life. So the mission of human life is to get out of these clutches of //māyā.// That is the real mission of life.

We are missing the point. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13]. We are accepting this body as everything. And the modern civilization means to enjoy bodily comforts as much as possible. That is perfection of civilization. No. That is not perfection of civilization. That they do not know. Especially the demons, the nondevotees, they do not know.

This question was raised by Hiraṇyakaśipu before Prahlāda, that "Why you are after so much Kṛṣṇa, nonsense God?" So he replied his father, //na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]: "My dear father, generally, demons like you..." [laughter] Yes. He addressed his father //asura-varya. Asura-varya// means "the best of the demons." He was not afraid. He was a five-years-old boy. And he inquired some question, "My dear boy, what you have learned first class from your teachers?" [Hindi] So Prahlāda Mahārāja addressed his father, //tat sādhu manye asura-varya. Asura-varya.// His father was addressed not "Father"; he was addressed, "My dear the best of the //asuras...//" //Asura-varya. Tat sādhu manye 'sura-varya dehinām.//

So when you become actually preacher of God consciousness, you cannot make any compromise. You must call the spade a spade. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. Prahlāda Mahārāja is one of the //mahājanas.// Out of the twelve //mahājanas,// he's one of them. Because he was very bold. He was not afraid of his demonic father. He chastised him in so many ways, but he was never afraid. So just like our people are being persecuted in Australia. You know? They have been put into jail because they are preaching Hare Kṛṣṇa.

So this is not very easy thing, easy-going. My Guru Mahārāja, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja, he did not like that his disciples would be easy-going, cheap Vaiṣṇava. Cheap Vaiṣṇava. //Mana tumi kisera vaiṣṇava.// He sang a song, "My dear mind, oh, you are going to be a Vaiṣṇava. And what kind of Vaiṣṇava you are?" //Mana tumi kisera vaiṣṇava, pratiṣṭhāra tare, nirjanera ghare, tava hari-nāma kevala kaitava.// "You are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura or Rūpa Gosvāmī, in a solitary place... Not solitary place. You are thinking of woman and money. That's all. Mind is filled with dirty things."

So this kind of //bhajana// is simply cheating. Cheating. He was after preaching. First of all, go door to door. Just like Nityānanda Prabhu did it at the risk of life. He was hurt by Jagāi-Mādhāi. Blood came out of His head. Lord Caitanya became very much angry. He wanted to kill immediately Jagāi Mādhāi. Lord Nityānanda said, "My dear Sir, You promised that this incarnation You'll not take any weapon. Please be kind upon them."

So this is Nityānanda. Nityānanda-vaṁśa means one who takes the risk of preaching work, he can claim Nityānanda-vaṁśa. Not that easy-going. The preaching work is not easy-going. There are so many difficulties. All the big, big preachers... Śrī Rāmānujācārya. His life was attempted to be killed. Why Rāmānujācārya? My Guru Mahārāja was attempted to be killed. Twenty-five thousand rupees were raised fund for bribing the police officer. He told me personally. The Navadvīpa..., Navadvīpa //gosāis,// they wanted to kill him.

So preaching work is always risky. //Tat sādhu manye 'sura-varya dehinām.// So //kṛṣṇa-sampraśnaḥ.// If you want to make the whole world peaceful, //yenātmā suprasīdati. Suprasīdati. Prasīdati// means to become satisfied, and //su// means super, extra satisfied. Then people should be educated to inquire about Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Simply. This very word. //Yat kṛtaḥ kṛṣṇa-sampraśnaḥ.// Make such propaganda in a way that everyone becomes inquisitive, "What is this nonsense, Kṛṣṇa, they are speaking?" At least...

Just like Jagāi-Mādhāi, when they... In the beginning, they were very much adverse to //saṅkīrtana, hari-saṅkīrtana,// but one day, the Mādhāi was telling to Jagāi, "My dear brother, Jagāi, after all, these rascals sing very nicely, [laughter] Hare Kṛṣṇa. They sing very..." "Oh, you are going to be Vaiṣṇava?" "No, no. I am not going to be Vaiṣṇava. [laughter] I'm just appreciating. They sing very nice." So you go like that. They will arrest you. You have got good experience. In London, they were arrested.

[aside:] You were in London. How many times you were arrested?

**Gurudāsa:**
Three.

**Prabhupāda:**
Three times. Our record is that our people were arrested thirty-six times. They... Now the police has become disgusted. They don't arrest. Yes. But this thing is going on in Australia, especially in Melbourne. I have got, received... So they asked me what to do. To do? "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and you'll get good opportunity. When you are put into jail, you'll be free to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." So they are doing that. They are not eating. The minister in charge of the jail department, he was perturbed that "These people are not eating," and they were allowed to that "You can cook." But they refused, because the same kitchen, they're cooking, I mean to say, flesh. So refused. So then after few days, they were let loose: "All right. You go home." Yes. So this is going on.

So religious persecution is always there. Even the father, what to speak of others. The father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, he chastised his son. So don't be afraid. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted. //Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]], Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. This is the mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Anyone you meet, any damn rascal or gentleman, it doesn't matter, try to convince him about Kṛṣṇa and let him inquire about Kṛṣṇa. Then his life will be successful. Simply he begins to inquire, "What is Kṛṣṇa?" Then his, means, he'll, path of liberation becomes open immediately.

Therefore Sūta Gosvāmī says, //yat kṛtaḥ kṛṣṇa-sampraśno yenātmā suprasīdati.// Actually, everyone is suffering. That is the law of material nature. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, he says, //viṣaya-viṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jvale, tore vare nā koinu upāy// [from //Prārthanā//]. //Viṣaya.// Those who are materialistic, that is called //viṣaya. Viṣaya// means eating, sleeping, sex intercourse and defense. How I shall be protected, how shall I enjoy sex, how I shall eat more, I shall sleep more: this is called //viṣaya. Viṣaya// does not mean a very rich man, //viṣayī.// A poor man can be //viṣayī,// and a rich man can be renounced.

Just like Rāmānanda Rāya. He was governor, a //gṛhastha,// not even //sannyāsī.// But Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted him not as //gṛhastha//---more than a //sannyāsī.// So //viṣaya. Viṣayī// means..., does not mean that if one is very rich, then he's //viṣayī. Viṣayī// means one is only interested with these four things: eating, sleeping, mating and defending. The whole world is going on like that. The modern civilization, they're simply interested how to eat, how to sleep... In your country, in America, you know very well. They're whole day working: how to construct a skyscraper building, how to own at least four cars.

So, so long we shall be attached to this //viṣaya,// simply, there cannot be any peace. There cannot be any peace. It is impossible. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that //viṣaya-viṣānale. Anala// means fire. There are different types of fire also. //Vi..., viṣānala,// the burning sensation by drinking poison. //Viṣaya-viṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jvale.// "Whole day and night, twenty-four hours, my heart is burning." //Viṣaya-viṣānale, tore vare nā koinu...// "I did not try how to get out of this blazing fire." //Golokera prema-dhana, hari-nama-saṅkīrtana, rati nā janmila kene tāy:// "The only, only relief is this //kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.//"

Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered that,

> bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

So //para-upakāra.// This human life is meant for doing, do..., doing well to others, not exploiting others. That is animalism: "I kill this animal and eat." Tiger, very powerful. That is animalism. It has no value. Who is..., who is asking for a tiger, although he's so powerful? There must be some //upakāra.// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is not tigerism, but welfare activities. People are very much so-called philanthropist. They open hospitals, schools and other things, but actually, they do not know what is the real disease of the human being. The real disease is that he has forgotten Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Otherwise, there is no scarcity in the world.

As I have repeatedly told you, that... Especially I have seen practically in America, in Africa, in Australia, there are so much immense scope for producing food that ten times of the whole population of the world could be fed simply by utilizing the open land still available. So there is no question of scarcity. We have simply mismanaged. Due to lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we have mismanaged things.

Kṛṣṇa says,

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ
> sarva-loka-maheśvaram
> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati
> [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]

If you want peace, then you try to understand these three principles of life. What is that? That Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer. No one else. All servants. //Ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa āra saba bhṛtya// [[books:cc:adi:5:142|[Cc. Ādi 5.142]]]. This... Everyone is servant. Not that "Oh, everyone is equal to Kṛṣṇa." That has become a cheap business. So many //kṛṣṇa-avatāras// and so many demigods, they are counted as good as Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "There is no more superior authority than Me."

So therefore this //kṛṣṇa-sampraśnaḥ,// if simply people become inquisitive what is Kṛṣṇa, and you simply try to answer them---we have got so many books now---then the whole world will be peaceful. //Yena ātmā suprasīdati.// Everyone is hankering after, "Where is peace? Where is peace?" You know, you European and American boys. You have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness because on account of your hankering, "Where is peace?" Is it not?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that? So you were..., you were not after money; because money and woman, you have seen enough. There is no scarcity of money and woman in Europe and America. You can earn any, as much as you like, and you can enjoy. But still, why they are coming out confused? They want something. That I have several times repeated, that your only qualification is, you are advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness because you are..., you have no other material desires.

//Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. Nobody can allure you by material inducements: "Oh, here is money. Please come. Here is woman. Please come." That you have seen. You want something. //Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 2.59]]]. So that's a very good qualification. Not only you who have come to me as my disciples---I am speaking of the whole Europeans and Americans.

So try to impress the whole Western world about //kṛṣṇa-sampraśnaḥ.// Then they'll be happy. That is our mission. //Yat kṛtaḥ kṛṣṇa-sampraśno yenātmā suprasīdati. Munayaḥ sādhu pṛṣṭo 'ham.// And Sūta Gosvāmī welcomed the inquiry, "Oh, it is a nice inquiry, very nice inquiry. You are inquiring about Kṛṣṇa. Oh, I have got this opportunity to answer." Anyone, any devotee, any servant of Kṛṣṇa, as soon as he'll be questioned by somebody about Kṛṣṇa, he'll be very, very happy: "Oh, here is an opportunity to speak about Kṛṣṇa." Just like when Nāradajī inquired from Brahmā that "I know that you are everything, but at the same time, I see that you are meditating upon somebody else. What is that?" So Nara... Brahmā welcomed this inquiry, "My dear Nārada, it is a very nice question. Now you have given me opportunity to speak about my master."

So great sages, they were congratulated by Sūta Gosvāmī, all the sages in the Naimiṣāraṇya. Just like you are sitting here. This is the process of understanding //kṛṣṇa-praśna.// Formerly there were no big halls. Just like in your country or all over the world, we are speaking in big, big halls. Formerly the method was... Just like here, in this very sacred place, [taps podium] all the Gosvāmīs used to study //Bhāgavatam// under the leadership of Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī. This is a very... This is the most important place in the world. So you have got this opportunity. So... [Hindi]

**Indian man:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā.// So at least for a few days let us sit down here, and under the protection of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī and Jīva Gosvāmī. This place is a very sanctified place. They used to assemble here. So we are not going to imitate them, but we want a place under the shelter of their lotus feet and discuss something of their contribution. Then our life may be one day successful.

Thank you very much. [break]

**Indian:**
[indistinct question]

**Prabhupāda:**
Three principles means to understand that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme, sole proprietor...

**Indian man:**
That is one

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And the second point is because He's the supreme proprietor, He's the supreme enjoyer. And generally, one who is enjoyer, people do not like. Now, just like these capitalist and the Communists. Capitalist, they have made their program for becoming enjoyer. And the capitalist, uh, Communist, they do not like it. Because they know, "These people are enjoyers. They cannot fulfill our desires." But Kṛṣṇa is not like that. Although He's the supreme enjoyer, although He's the supreme proprietor, He is the best friend of everyone---//suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. //Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām//---He's not friend of the rich class of men or the...

Just like we be..., these political leaders, they become friend of the country. But they are their own party men. "I am Congress Party," "I am this party," so "I, I love my this party." And even if he loves all human beings, he sends the animals to the slaughterhouse. So he cannot be friend of everyone. But Kṛṣṇa is friend of everyone. You have seen Kṛṣṇa's picture. He's embracing the calf also, and He's embracing Rādhārāṇī. Not that He's simply attached to Rādhārāṇī and the //gopīs.// He's attached to everyone, every living entity. //Sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūr...// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the best friend of everyone.

So if you want friendship, you make friendship with Kṛṣṇa. And because He's the proprietor, He'll protect you. These are the three points. Is that clear? Or you have got any question, you can question. Let it be clear. This is very intelligent question. So if we have to search out a friend, just search out Kṛṣṇa. Make friendship with Kṛṣṇa. //Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām.// He'll satisfy you in all respects. And He's not poor, because //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. He's... He's the proprietor of everything. What do you want? Everything will be supplied. He's so nice friend. So if you one understand these three points about Kṛṣṇa, then our life becomes successful.

**Devotee:**
Devotees should try... [break] ...a person to inquire about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. On the other hand, it should be...

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Devotee:**
...uncompromising.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. No. Thing is that if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// this very process will make his heart clean. Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be understood not in dirty condition of mind. //Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpam.// That is the definition given by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa..., to understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.// Persons who are simply engaged in pious activities and completely, all sinful reaction of his life has ceased, //te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā bhajante mām// [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]], he's no..., no more hesitating, or checked. //Ahaituky apratihatā.// He can serve Kṛṣṇa, he can love Kṛṣṇa.

So this process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa means making him cleansed of all sinful reactions. So he'll chant, he'll hear, and as he hears, his heart becomes clean. Then he will naturally inquire about Kṛṣṇa. So you have to create that situation. You go on chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and as people will hear, his heart will be cleansed. Naturally he will be inquiring about Kṛṣṇa. They do not inquire about Kṛṣṇa because the heart is...

[break] ...hearing and chanting. Then he'll be cleansed.

**Devotee:**
Prabhupāda? We were talking about the importance of preaching. Does it make any difference whether it's in India or in the United States?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

[no audio]

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone is Kṛṣṇa's. Where is your neckbeads?

**Gurudāsa:**
Oh, here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Gurudāsa:**
They came..., they came untied, and so I tied them together just like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
You must have your neck..., neckbeads tight.

**Gurudāsa:**
Right around the neck?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So what is your question? There is no question... Preaching..., preaching is... Preaching... Haridāsa Ṭhākura was inquired by Caitanya Mahāprabhu that, that "You are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Is it for everyone?" Haridāsa Ṭhākura replied: "Yes, it is for every... Even the trees, the birds, the beasts, they'll be benefited." So what is the question of human society? Here or there, it doesn't matter.

**Gurudāsa:**
We've developed...

**Indian man:**
If hearing is more important than chanting, then from whom a man should hear about Kṛṣṇa? It is from anyone?

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that question?

**Devotee:**
He says hearing, hearing is more important...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything is more important, but hearing is especially given.

**Indian man:**
From whom one should hear about Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
From Kṛṣṇa devotee, not a professional man.

**Indian man:**
How one can tell that he is a devotee of Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
That requires little intelligence. One has to learn. It cannot be... You have to see that by chanting Kṛṣṇa, what he is doing? He is maintaining his body, or he is actually desirous of advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That you have to know. Chant. [end]
