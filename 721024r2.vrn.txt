====== Room Conversation ======

[No audio]

**Prabhupāda:**
We are worshiping with ordinary water.

**Devotee (1):**
And as soon as it touches the Deity, it becomes...

**Prabhupāda:**
As soon as it touches Deities, become Ganges water, Yamuna water. Why Yamuna is so pure? Because Kṛṣṇa touched it. So after touching Kṛṣṇa, the ordinary water become Yamuna. Why not?

**Devotee (1):**
Yes, it's a fact.

**Devotee (2):**
I thought perhaps it was the...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no perhaps. This is the conclusion. What is that perhaps?

**Devotee (2):**
I was thinking because genuine //tulasī// are available in Vrndavana, it would be nice to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (2):**
It would be nice to get //tulasī// beads here.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. But whatever the ordinary beads on which you have chanted, it has already become //tulasī.// And what is the guarantee that is genuine //tulasī// what you have brought? Have you seen?

**Devotee (2):**
They give a little guarantee.

**Prabhupāda:**
They give, but how do you know it is genuine? They can cheat you.

**Devotee (2):**
Yeah, I know. That one shop in Vrndavana is supposed to be...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. There are many cheaters. You can keep some. So the conclusion should be that any bead you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, it is //tulasī.// If you chant regularly according to the initiation process, that is //tulasī.// It becomes. The same example. How you worship... [break] ...ordinary water, how?

**Devotee (2):**
You said that when it touched the Deity, it becomes sacred.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. Why Ganges is pure? Because it is coming through the toes of Visnu. //Pada-nakha-nira-janita-jana-pavana// [Śrī Daśāvatāra Stotra 5]. The Ganges has become so pure because it has touched the toes of Visnu. So as soon as any water touches... The Ganges water, also any water, it was not Ganges; after touching the lotus feet of Visnu, it has become Ganges.

**Devotee (2):**
So you wouldn't approve of getting a new set of [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you are already chanting on beads, that is already //tulasī.// Why do you think of another //tulasī,// another //tulasī?// It will depend on chanting, how pure you are in chanting. It is half past ten now?

**Devotee (2):**
It is ten until nine o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (2):**
Ten until nine o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means ten minutes to nine.

**Devotee (2):**
Yes.

**Devotee (1):**
Would you like us to take leave so that you can...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (2):**
May I stay and talk to you for a few minutes, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Devotee (3):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, may I ask you a question?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Devotee (3):**
Yesterday you were talking, and so many other days you've always been saying about taking up the responsibility of management in order to manage the affairs of the Society. I'm a very insignificant //brahmacārī,// but what is it that I can do that would be able to help to make management of the Society?

**Prabhupāda:**
I shall tell you.

**Devotee (2):**
Your lectures, they are very nice, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I've been trying to be your disciple for the last almost three years now.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] All right, [indistinct].

**Devotee (2):**
I have been having some falldown in the last three years because of sex desire, and each time I have come back because I cannot escape Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you can marry.

**Devotee (2):**
That is the difficulty. My other Godbrothers, they put very great obstruction in my path also. And in some cases when they have given information, I have been misdirected. In one case, I was directed by Girirāja wrongly and I was... I got... Bhavānanda got a letter from your secretary, Śyāmasundara, saying that I should be thrown out of India. So Bhavānanda now, I am more or less under his government in Calcutta. And I have asked him about marriage, he knows my position, and he has said better I should leave than take marriage.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, you shall go. Now you can go.

**Devotee (2):**
Can I ask you what course I should take?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not today. I am tired.

**Devotee (2):**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you very much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotee (2):**
I should call Śrutakīrti for you if he is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [long pause] So why have you been taking rest? [indistinct]

**Śrutakīrti:**
I'll take down. I'll take down the Dictaphone also in case the electricity goes on. [end]
