**Prabhupāda:**
You have not met?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, I have met him. At Janmāṣṭamī two years ago at New Vrindavan.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
He is coming in on the third shift, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
They will... Girirāja and Bhavānanda and them, they will probably be in the third shift, depending on how the land deal goes, whether it is settled by then.

**Prabhupāda:**
It must be settled. Not whether. Therefore I have asked so many people to go there. It must be settled.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
The last situation I had heard was that everybody was agreeable, that Nair himself was agreeable and that everything was proceeding, but it was in the hands of the Municipality, and that was going so slow, and that Nair himself, he is saying so many dubious things on the outside, but in complete agreement once you step into a room with him. So we are not so much sure. It's more or less in the hands of the Municipality, but who knows what is going on behind the table. Something like that. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Take a little breakfast?

**Gurudāsa:**
They said you wanted to see me?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Oh, about that typing.

**Gurudāsa:**
//Ācchā.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you have secured that house in London.

**Gurudāsa:**
Oh, //jaya!// All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] Berkshire Palace.

**Devotee (1):**
Berkshire Palace, very impressive.

**Gurudāsa:**
Duke of Windsor's castle[?].

**Devotee (1):**
He's the king there, right? The queen's husband.

**Prabhupāda:**
He was to be the king, but he rejected for that one common girl. So the ministry asked him that "You have to give up this girl or you have to give up your throne." So he preferred to give up his throne.

And the present queen's father, his second brother, he was made king, King George VI. Otherwise, this Duke of Windsor... When he refused to become the king, he became the Duke of Windsor and he was given this Berkshire Palace.

**Gurudāsa:**
He also is the one who has the Windsor Palace?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Windsor Palace is the queen's. That is some seasonal residence. This Buckingham Palace is office. Actually, for residential palace, the Windsor Palace. Windsor Palace?

**Gurudāsa:**
Windsor, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That palace we see in passing.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, large palace.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
Windsor.

**Prabhupāda:**
Berkshire Palace is also nearby.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is nearer to John's Tittenhurst. What is that?

**Gurudāsa:**
Tittenhurst Park.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tittenhurst Park. [to Sarasvatī:] Come on, come on. Come on. So Sarasvatī devī, we have got good news: your father is coming tomorrow. It is all right? Śyāmasundara is coming tomorrow. You like?

**Gurudāsa:**
She says she has four fathers and mothers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Four fathers?

**Gurudāsa:**
And mothers.

**Devotee (1):**
Who are they?

**Sarasvatī:**
[indistinct] [devotees laugh]

**Prabhupāda:**
Four fathers and four mothers?

**Sarasvatī:**
Four fathers and [indistinct]. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Śyāmasundara is coming tomorrow.

**Sarasvatī:**
I told her.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have told her?

**Sarasvatī:**
I told her that she's..., Śyāmasundara is coming very soon.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ohhhh, that's nice. [break] ...men Monday?

**Acyutānanda:**
We can send them, but they won't go.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if you can make somebody agree, then he is coming tomorrow or day after tomorrow.

**Acyutānanda:**
But no one will agree to leave you.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Acyutānanda:**
Letter from the press, regarding my songbook.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Acyutānanda:**
So I don't know what to do. Nobody would like to go, to leave you. We would like to go, but we wouldn't want to miss your classes.

**Gurudāsa:**
That is so.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can make one condition, that if you return us, we can go at eight or nine, but you must return us by four. Then we can go. Make this condition. Instead of saying no, make some condition.

**Acyutānanda:**
It's the 29th?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
And he's coming tomorrow?

**Prabhupāda:**
I have asked him to come day after tomorrow. He comes generally at about ten.

**Acyutānanda:**
But I heard that last year we went and it was not a very big function. [break] I wrote that letter to this Lalitānanda about this Jāhnavī...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Acyutānanda:**
Jāhnavī-sampradāya.

**Prabhupāda:**
Jāhnavī-sampradāya? Oh, yes, yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
So they don't want to put it in //Back to Godhead// because I used the word "infantile, naive, undereducated and incompetent," and that's considered most ungentlemanly.

**Devotee (2):**
They do not like publishing [indistinct] articles.

**Acyutānanda:**
But Prabhupāda says fools and rascals and...

**Devotee (2):**
I have written so many articles in the past two years, and one has been published in two years.

**Prabhupāda:**
For //Back to Godhead?//

**Devotee (2):**
//Back to Godhead,// yes. They say no one can understand them.

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct] from Subala dāsa Mahārāja that they have received his letter on September 16th and I have requested Karandhara to send him one //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.//

**Devotee (2):**
Karandhara has already said no. [laughs] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[converses in Hindi with guests] [break] [end]
