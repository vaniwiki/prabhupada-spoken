====== Room Conversation ======

**Gurudāsa:**
...then I must agitate my mind either how to stop the intoxicant or how to get it.

**Prabhupāda:**
And if we get the management of this temple, that will be triumph in [indistinct] Vṛndāvana. It is the most important place.

**Gurudāsa:**
And actually, the man who came yesterday, this Mr. Nath and some men who come regularly, they would like to see it, because they like this...

**Prabhupāda:**
Mr. Nath?

**Gurudāsa:**
There is one man who comes every day, a Vṛndāvana resident.

**Prabhupāda:**
But the one thing, you know there is one physician?

**Gurudāsa:**
Printer and physician, yes?

**Prabhupāda:**
Printer also? He has published some //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// What is his name?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, I know it. Hari Nama Press? The press is Hari Nama Press.

**Prabhupāda:**
The physician's name.

**Gurudāsa:**
Nagia. Dr. Nagia, N-a-g-i-a.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nagia. What is his first name?

**Gurudāsa:**
His father's name...

**Prabhupāda:**
His father's name. I gave him one set of books, //Bhāgavata,// to sell [indistinct]. So you have to inquire from him whether it is sold. If not, return. So... [break]

**Gurudāsa:**
Sudāmā Vipra Mahārāja has such reverence for Siddha-svarūpa, that the other students do not like that, because they think he is treating Siddha-svarūpa with respect when he should be treating you with respect. So naturally, the students love you and so they don't like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not like to give him extra...

**Gurudāsa:**
Respect, at the expense of yourself.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no such thing. They all stop[?].

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, they are nice boys. Secondly, for some reason, they don't like..., they like to cook themselves.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurudāsa:**
They like to cook for themselves. They cook without spices and similar like that, because they are thinking of their health. I gave them... I know, I can... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] a nice place, a very open place. [indistinct]

**Gurudāsa:**
Very nice place.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Gurudāsa:**
You have your choice.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, it's a very nice place, undoubtedly.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. The nicest place in Vṛndāvana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Gurudāsa:**
One of the nicest buildings. He had so many buildings in Vṛndāvana from his dynasty, but they have all been taken by unscrupulous //pūjārīs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Gurudāsa:**
They've been taken by unscrupulous //pūjārīs// that are just squatting illegally. And so he says, "All right, let them have it." But this one he has kept, because it is so first class.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we shall have to deal with this //pūjārī.//

**Gurudāsa:**
This one...

**Prabhupāda:**
Is nice?

**Gurudāsa:**
Nice, and he jumps when the Mahārāja speaks. I don't think he will be [indistinct], this //pūjārī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
He is alone, or he has got some associates?

**Gurudāsa:**
Alone.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is living with family?

**Gurudāsa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Alone.

**Gurudāsa:**
Alone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then, satisfy him.

**Gurudāsa:**
We will retain him in some way.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. You retain him.

**Gurudāsa:**
That is the system, that he stays there, but we will do the //pūjārī// work.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Give him salary.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is being paid?

**Gurudāsa:**
I think they must be.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway, whatever he is being paid, we shall pay it. [indistinct]

**Gurudāsa:**
Bharatpur-rāj also knows it, because he announced to this chairman of the council that he will become the gardener and they will become the //pūjārīs.// So he is for that.

**Prabhupāda:**
The poor man, unless he gets some income, he becomes disturbed.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is not renounced. So let him satisfy [indistinct]. So when you are going to talk to the Mahārāja?

**Gurudāsa:**
I will be going today if he sends a car. Or if not, I think I will go tomorrow. But that means I cannot go to Delhi. But I don't think... I think Manasvī and Mr. Sarkar, the engineer, can handle this deal. It's just to see if they can give another allotment.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not that everywhere you have to go. You go to the important business.

**Gurudāsa:**
So which do you think is more important---this deal or the palace? I think the palace.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyone can purchase. But to get the palace, it requires very tactful dealing.

**Gurudāsa:**
Subala Mahārāja and I are going to Mathurā today to find out the position what they have done in relationship to this sanction, written sanction.

**Prabhupāda:**
From Mathurā, then go to Bharatpur.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
From Mathurā, Bharatpur is near.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think there is train or bus.

**Gurudāsa:**
There is bus, train. But the thing is, he may be sending a car here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Gurudāsa:**
So I am getting a message from that boy who wrote the article, with the moustache. The boy who wrote the article, he has gone to Bharatpur with that note.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. He is very good boy.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just keep him as our friend. Give him nice food, //prasādam.// He is intelligent. He considers that //āratik// very nice.

**Gurudāsa:**
He has been coming since the beginning. Since we first came he has been coming.

**Prabhupāda:**
So keep him as good friend.

**Gurudāsa:**
I try to do that with everyone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Especially he is good..., very nicely inclined. He is married or not?

**Gurudāsa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] what does he do?

**Gurudāsa:**
He lives with his father, and he goes to Bon Mahārāja University.

**Prabhupāda:**
For education?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. But I asked him, "Do they teach any spiritual philosophy there?" and he said no.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no spiritual philosophy. It is an academic, ordinary college. People understand that where is the credit, there are so many colleges. Responsible people, they understand that I am doing much more valuable thing.

So what is the use of these schools and colleges? That [indistinct] school, college is not very good. And there are so many schools and colleges. That is not very extraordinary thing.

**Gurudāsa:**
Now I understand that Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, that school is not teaching spiritual philosophy. I told many people that if we got a chance to open a university, we would not compromise. We would not do anything with the government if they restricted our curriculum...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
...without spiritual... Without spiritual, it is void.

**Prabhupāda:**
What do they say?

**Gurudāsa:**
They think. Then I say, "You can teach all the subjects and also teach the spiritual. "

**Prabhupāda:**
If we organize our Bombay, then we shall regularly teach all the students from the very beginning. And in London also we shall. London, Dallas. So that these students will be transferred.

Their parents will be very glad that our students have gone to foreign countries for studying. We shall have very, very good sympathies. Our only policy will be the students should be taught very nice English for understanding our books. Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
In Bombay rather than Māyāpur?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Gurudāsa:**
In Bombay rather than...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere. Everywhere. But you make higher study, higher study, higher study.

**Gurudāsa:**
Māyāpur can be the highest.

**Prabhupāda:**
That you [indistinct]. All, everywhere this existence[?] should be: lower class, higher class. But our all institutions should be for giving spiritual. We have got so many books. Simply he has to learn English and Sanskrit, that's all. [indistinct] history. So we are not going to follow the university curriculum. No. We have got our own.

**Gurudāsa:**
We have had experience in the university, and it has not satisfied us. We have come to you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not only you; I know what is [indistinct], what nonsense they give.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yamunā?

**Yamunā:**
Yes, //prabhu?//

**Gurudāsa:**
Where is that file, that spiritual exposition? I wanted to show it to Prabhupāda.

**Yamunā:**
//Prabhu,// I looked for it, I couldn't find it.

**Gurudāsa:**
Recently? I'll look again.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we shall now go?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, we can go now.

**Prabhupāda:**
What's the time now? Six?

**Gurudāsa:**
[indistinct] upstairs. Shall I get it?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Gurudāsa:**
I should put it on. You're always asking me the time. I should put it on. [break] [end]
