**Pradyumna:**
[reading:] "So when our senses are engaged for the actual proprietor of the senses, that is called devotional service. In our conditional state, our senses are engaged in serving these bodily demands. When the same senses are engaged in executing the order of Kṛṣṇa, it is called //bhakti.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Bhakti,// it is very simple thing. Our relationship with Kṛṣṇa is natural. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mamaivāṁśa jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa; therefore our only duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is natural. There is no question about it. Part and parcel means helping the whole. As we have several times explained that this finger is the part and parcel of my body, so it is the duty of the finger always serve the body, whole body. It has no other occupation. As soon as I desire, "Finger, you come to this place," immediately it comes. "Finger, you come to this place," immediately it comes.

So we can study. What is the meaning of part and parcel? Part and parcel means to serve the whole. Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth. We are relative truth. Therefore it is our duty to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is our natural position. But at the present moment, we are engaging our senses, ourself, in designation. I am thinking, "I am American," I am thinking, "I am Hindu," I am thinking, "I am //brāhmaṇa//" or "I am //sannyāsī.//" So many designation.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu presented Himself how to become designationless, //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. He said, "I am not a //brāhmaṇa.// I am not a //śūdra.// I am not a //kṣatriya.// I am not a //brahmacārī.//" He denied. At last He said, //gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayoḥ dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. This is our position. We are not Indian; we are not American; we are not Hindu; we are not Muslim. These are all designation.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to make people free from designation. Just like actually you see: Here are American, European boys and girls. They have forgotten that they are American or European or they come from Christian group or Jewish group. Similarly, we should also forget that "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," or "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //śūdra,//" "I am //kṣatriya.//" No. This is the only platform, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, where we can unite on spiritual platform. We cannot be united by resolutions. Just like the United Nation: they are trying for the last thirty years to become united---but simply it is illusion. On that platform we cannot be united. On political platform or social platform, that is not possible, because the designations are there.

When we are free from designation, //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam,// when we are purified, then we can unite in the service of the Lord, Kṛṣṇa. That is real unity. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam...// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. That is Vaikuṇṭha platform. Just like in Vaikuṇṭha the Vaikuṇṭheśvara, Nārāyaṇa, or Kṛṣṇa, He's the central point of service. Just like in Vṛndāvana. The Vṛndāvana... The animals, the birds, the beasts, the water, the trees, the flowers, the cowherds boy---everyone---center is Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana. They did not know that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but they loved Kṛṣṇa with their heart and soul. That is Vṛndāvana.

So if we come to this point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and simply learn how to love Kṛṣṇa, then we can create the whole world as Vṛndāvana. Unfortunately, even in the Vṛndāvana at the present moment, because our desires have been something else other than serving Kṛṣṇa, there are so many factions. The center is missing.

So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to purify our senses from the designation and engage the senses in the service of the Lord. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. That is described here. That is wanted. It is called //bhakti.// "In our conditional state our senses are engaged in serving these bodily demands. When the same senses are engaged in executing the order of Kṛṣṇa, it is called //bhakti.//" This is //bhakti.//

Just like Arjuna. Arjuna served Kṛṣṇa by his talent. He was a soldier; he knew how to fight. So by..., for his personal consideration, he was thinking not to fight, not to kill the other side, because the other side happened to be his kinsmen, his grandfather, his brother, his nephews. So he was thinking in terms of his own sense gratification, because "The other side, if they are killed, I'll be unhappy." That was his consideration. Therefore he was not willing to fight. And to induce him to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, the whole //Bhagavad-gītā// was explained. And at the end Kṛṣṇa asked Arjuna, "What is your decision?" //Yathecchasi tathā kuru// [[books:bg:18:63|[Bg. 18.63]]]: "You can do whatever you like. I have given you instruction, full instruction. Now whatever you like, you can do."

This means every living entity has got a little independence. Kṛṣṇa, or God, does not interfere with that independence. //Yathecchasi tathā kuru.// At the last, also, Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You do it." Kṛṣṇa can instruct us, "You do it." If I don't do it, that is my option. That option is always there. Kṛṣṇa does not oblige me. Otherwise, what is the difference between me and the stone? The stone has no independence, but I am living entity; I have got my independence.

So do... Kṛṣṇa does not interfere with my independence. Voluntarily, if we surrender to Kṛṣṇa, voluntarily if we serve Him, then our life is successful. Voluntarily. //Hitvā anyathā-rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. We can become immediately liberated if we give up our designated post. If we simply come to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then immediately we become liberated. So many sages and saintly persons are trying to become liberated, //mukta,// to merge into the existence of impersonal Brahman. But because they have no information of Kṛṣṇa, or they do not like to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, they fall down. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]].

So we must stick to Kṛṣṇa consciousness without any designative ideas. We must stand on the transcendental platform. //Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. Transcendental platform means above the three modes of material nature, which is called //brahma-bhūtaḥ.// So this position, //brahma-bhūtaḥ's// position... Without being in //brahma-bhūtaḥ// position, liberated stage, nobody can be engaged in devotional service.

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

//Bhakti// begins when is..., one is actually liberated from the influence of the modes of material nature. That is real //bhakti.// Otherwise, when you are..., we are in training, that is called //prakṛta-bhakta.//

Actually, we are in the material state, but we are being trained up, the Deity worship. This is, following the rules and regulations under the instruction of spiritual master, or Vedic injunction, this is training period. But even in the training period, if one is sincere and serious, he's liberated. He's liberated. It is so nice. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice that even in the training period, although he's not mature, and even one falls immature stage, there is no loss.

That is also confirmed by Nārada Muni: //tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer patet tato yadi apakva...// [[books:sb:1:5:17|[SB 1.5.17]]]. There is a verse like this---I don't exactly remember---that if one is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and, without being mature, somehow or other if he falls down, there is no loss, whereas other persons, who are sticking to their //sva-dharma// but has no idea of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he does not gain anything. These are the statement of Nārada. Therefore our position should be, our real active life begins when we begin to serve Kṛṣṇa with our senses without being designated, without being situated in designation. This is transcendental state.

Therefore a //bhakta,// Vaiṣṇava, Vaiṣṇava should not be considered that he's coming from European group or this group or that group. No. //Vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. Vaiṣṇava should not be considered belonging to any //jāti. Vaiṣṇave, arcye śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-mati// [Padma Purāṇa]. Just like we worship Deity. Everyone knows that Deity is made of stone, but do we worship the stone? Do we construct so big, big temples for worshiping a piece of stone? No. Unless one has got this conception that "Here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //sākṣād brajendra-nandana...//" Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw Jagannātha temple and immediately fainted. He saw //sākṣād brajendra-nandana hari,// Kṛṣṇa, immediately.

So we have to learn how to see Vaiṣṇava and Viṣṇu. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. That means we have to purify our senses. Then we can see Kṛṣṇa always.

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yam śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.38]

One has to smear the eyes with the ointment of love, how to love Kṛṣṇa. Then one can see Kṛṣṇa always within his heart. And one who has learned this art, how to see Kṛṣṇa within himself, within his heart always, Kṛṣṇa certifies, "he's the topmost //yogī.//"

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gata antarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

These are clear things. There is no hazy idea. Everything is clear. We have to become designationless, free from designation. We shall forget. Not that "Here are some foreigners. Pick up some quarrel with them and try to drive them away. Why they have come?" So many nonsense things are going on for want of actual spiritual education. This is not good, at least, for Vṛndāvana. This is not good.

People have not been educated properly with the Vṛndāvana spirit. Therefore things are happening like that. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]: how to engage the senses, being freed from designation, in the service of the Lord, that is Vṛndāvana life; that is Vṛndāvana atmosphere. If there is any other purpose than this, then it is very difficult to utilize the opportunity, the fortune of living in Vṛndāvana. One has to be designationless.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"As long as one identifies himself as belonging to a certain family, a certain society or a certain person, he is said to covered with designations. When one is fully aware that he does not belong to any family, society or country, but is eternally related to Kṛṣṇa, he then realizes that his energy should be employed not in the interests of so-called family, society or country, but in the interests of Kṛṣṇa. This..., this is purity of purpose and the platform of pure devotional service in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
So our purpose... The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is started with this summary idea, that nobody should think himself as belonging to certain family or sect or religion or country or nation. All these designation have created havoc in the world, these false designation. When I think that "This country is mine," it is a false designation. Country is not mine; I am a guest here.

If I stay in a country, in a place, for, say, twenty years, fifty years, hundred years, does it..., does it mean that it belongs to me? Because they have no Kṛṣṇa conscious idea, they are misled in thinking in that way. Some group of men are thinking that "This is our country": "We are American," "We are Indian," "We are German." This is the false... Illusion.

Actually, everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. He's the proprietor. But because people are not educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are thinking, "I am the proprietor." //Ahaṁ mameti janasya moho 'yam// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This //ahaṁ mama,// increasing the //ahaṁ mama,// is illusion, is //māyā.// And that is going on.

Therefore there is great need of spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the human society. Those who are actually welfare workers, they should come forward and join this movement to spread it. Actually, it is being accepted very nicely. Although not nicely, they have begun to accept it all over the world. This is our experience. And if we present the philosophy in correct viewpoint, people will accept it. And people will accept it, and people from all parts of the world will come to Vṛndāvana. Because they are hearing about Vṛndāvana, about Kṛṣṇa, naturally they are very much anxious to visit.

But if we do not receive them nicely, if we remain sectarian, oh, it will be an unfortunate thing. That is my request. Those who are inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they should be prepared to receive these foreigners who are being educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They should come here to visit; so they should be received, they should be welcomed. That is my request.

Yes. Next.

**Pradyumna:**
“ 'The Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service.' In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Third Canto, Twenty-ninth Chapter, 10th verse [[books:sb:3:29:10|[SB 3.29.10]]], Śrīla Kapiladeva, while instructing His mother, has given the following characteristics of pure devotional service: 'My dear mother, those who are My pure devotees, and who have no desire for material benefit or philosophical speculation, have their minds so much engaged in My service that they are never interested in asking Me for anything---except to be engaged in that service. They do not even beg to live in My abode with Me.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is pure devotional purpose. Natural. "Here is a Kṛṣṇa devotee." How much one should be glad to see a Kṛṣṇa devotee. Naturally, his love for a Kṛṣṇa devotee should enhance. That is pure devotion. Just like in foreign country, when one Indian meets another Indian, naturally he has got some tendency: "Oh, wherefrom you are coming? How long you are here?" This conversation go on.

Similarly, natural flow of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is that as soon as one sees a person in Vaiṣṇava symptoms, he should be eager to welcome him. He should be very much anxious to talk with him about Kṛṣṇa, //kṛṣṇa-kathā. Bodhayantaḥ parasparam tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca// [[books:bg:10:9|[Bg. 10.9]]]. Kṛṣṇa conscious people should be so nice that as soon as they meet together, they talk about Kṛṣṇa, they try to understand about Kṛṣṇa, and they feel pleasure in that way. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness society.

We are trying to make a Kṛṣṇa consciousness society to give this opportunity to these people, how one should be engladdened by seeing one devotee and talk with them, one another, about Kṛṣṇa, forgetting their designations. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"There are five kinds of liberation, namely, to become one with the Lord, to live with the Supreme Lord on the same planet, to have the same features as the Lord, to enjoy the same opulences as the Lord and to live as a companion of the Lord. A devotee, not to speak of rejecting material sense gratification, does not even want any of the five kinds of liberation. He is satisfied simply by discharging loving service to the Lord. That is the characteristic of pure devotion."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is instructed by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He rejects: //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. The //karmīs,// they want all these things. //Na... Dhanam:// great riches, and beautiful wife, great followers. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu is rejecting these, and He's rejecting also liberation. //Dhiyamanaṁ na ghṛnanti//[?]. A pure devotee is not interested even in liberation. That is pure devotee.

That... Just like Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, he says, //kīṭa janma ha-u yathā tuyā dāsa, bahir mukha brahma janme nāhi mora āśā// [//Mānasa Deha Geha// 5]. A devotee does not pray that "Give me this, give me that, give me that." No. He prays that "Whatever You like, if You like me to take birth as an insect, that's all right. But my only request is that I may become an insect in the house of a devotee, so that I may get the chance of prosecuting my devotional service, I may eat the remnants of foodstuff eaten by the devotee."

Just like Bhārata Mahārāja, he became a deer, but he was associating with saintly persons. He understood that "I was formerly King Bhārata. By chance, my mind being absorbed in the thinking of a deer, I have become a deer. All right. Doesn't matter." So he was associating with devotees.

Similarly, a devotee is not interested to become liberated, go back to home, back to Godhead. Of course, even if he's not interested, Kṛṣṇa takes him. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. That is natural. But that is not our... We don't pray to Kṛṣṇa for anything of sense gratification. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said, //mama janmani janmani īśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. //Ahaitukī apratihatā.// Our simply..., simple desire is how to be engaged in the service of the Lord. //Janmani janmani.//

When, when Caitanya Mahāprabhu speaks //janmani janmani,// that means He rejects liberation also. //Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na...., kavitāṁ vā yāce.// This is the //karmī's, jñānī's...// And even liberation; He rejects liberation. //Mama janmani.// If one is liberated, then why is the question of //janmani janmani?// So liberation is also not aspired by a devotee. These are the characteristics of pure devotion.

This chapter is "Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service." Pure devotional service should be without any desire, //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. They..., others, they are trying to make Kṛṣṇa //śūnyam, śūnyavādi;// our attempt should be to make our desires //śūnyam.// Simply we be engaged in the service of the Lord. That is pure devotion.

Go on, one paragraph more. What is the time now?

**Pradyumna:**
"In the above statement by Kapiladeva from the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the actual position of a pure devotee is described, and the primary characteristics of devotional service are also defined. Further characteristics of devotional service are described by Rūpa Gosvāmī with evidences from different scriptures. He states that there are six characteristics of pure devotional service, which are as follows: (1) Pure devotional service brings immediate relief from all kinds of material distress. (2) Pure devotional service is the beginning of all auspiciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī has described,

> viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate vidhi-mahendrādiś ca kīṭāyate
> yat-kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhavavatāṁ gauram eva stumaḥ
> [Caitanya-candrāmṛta 5]

When actually one comes in the platform of devotional service, for him, there is no problem. The whole world is disturbed, agitated with so many problems, but for a devotee, there is no problem. //Viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate.// And they are trying..., the whole world is trying to become very big man. Somebody's trying to be very big merchant or big industrialist or minister, or this or that, and others, they are trying to occupy the post of Indra, Candra, //devata.// That is competition, going on. As soon as there is some competition, even persons, demigods like Indra, Candra, they become disturbed, and they try to stop it.

But a devotee has no such concern. He's not disturbed. Because he's engaged in the service of the Lord, he feels so much happy that he has no disturbance. //Viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate.// Neither he is anxious to occupy any very big post. Because for a devotee, //vidhi-mahendrādiś ca kīṭāyate// [Caitanya-candrāmṛta 5]. He knows that "What is this position? Say, for some years, ten years, twenty years, fifty years, hundred years, millions years." It is limited. As soon as the limited span of life is finished, either in this world, either in this planet, or in other planets...

Suppose I go to the heavenly planet, I occupy the post of Indra. What is that? It is also limited. //Kṣīne puṇye martya-lokaṁ viśanti// [[books:bg:9:21|[Bg. 9.21]]]. So long you have got assets of pious activities, you can occupy such post; then again come down. //Ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]. So in this way we are wandering from up, down, down, up. In this way.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said,

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍe kono bhāgyavān jīva
> guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

We are wandering, life after life, in different species of life, different forms of life, in different planetary system. And that is going on. This is not progress. Where is progress? You are conditioned within this universe. Where is your progress? Suppose you... Just like if I jump with a limited space, where is my progress?

Real progress is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. If we actually want to make progress, then we must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that after leaving this body there is no more coming down to accept a material body. That is real progress. Otherwise, there is no progress. It is simply wandering with a limited space. That is not progress at all. But because we are in illusion, we are thinking it is progress. It is not progress.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
