**Guru dāsa:**
Prabhupāda on a morning walk, 10th of November.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] in life.

**Acyutānanda:**
What?

**Guru dāsa:**
He said he was very bad.

**Acyutānanda:**
I saw him also. I can see no justification for such cruelty. I do not care to see my two Godbrothers who committed such a crime. I feel that I will not be able to control my anger with them. I feel that they should be asked to leave the society. Whatever your divine grace decides in this matter I accept. [break]

**Guru dāsa:**
After the incident with Gopal Gosvāmī.

**Acyutānanda:**
Subal and Rāghavācārya [break] he said [break] he was awake and he had a blanket over his head. Subal. And Subal told him to get up. He stayed up there and was chanting //japa.// Then Subal threw a bucket of water on him and he just stayed there doing //japa.// Then he went inside to get some more water and then he [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not [indistinct] required but he was beaten severe.

**Acyutānanda:**
I can’t imagine [indistinct] threatened him with a knife or something. He could provoke that but I heard [indistinct] going to hit him with a bucket. Gopal was [indistinct] with a bucket.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
And throw him out if he hit him but this is severe.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
This is atrocious.

**Śrutakīrti:**
That evening he felt justified in what he did.

**Acyutānanda:**
Hm?

**Śrutakīrti:**
He said he felt justified in doing it. And then he mentioned your lecture the other night saying that in the Vedic society if someone was attacked like that then he would be killed. [break] he was using this as a ground and he felt justified in attacking him like that. Helping his Godbrother.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes very warped. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...fight amongst ourselves? Fight with the enemy but not with the Godbrothers. [indistinct] [break]

**Śrutakīrti:**
He doesn’t consider him to be a Godbrother but an enemy. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
He has taken the beating part of beating. No?

**Devotee:**
[break] [indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Serious [break] Gosāi he is also paralysed.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? That means he has left the hospital?

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is [indistinct] He has left the hospital. But where is his [indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
Well [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] very serious how he has left hospital? The police came to enquire about him, that means hospital let him go.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] knife to the police.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes everything if he is reporting all these things to the police [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] [indistinct] he has left the hospital...

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...by the evening. [break]

**Acyutānanda:**
Unusual why he would [indistinct] he said something about the 21 [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Acyutānanda:**
That didn’t, it got translated I think in Hindi.

**Devotee:**
He attacks them with his words, calls them all caste Gosvāmīs and Māyāvādīs so he didn’t bother.

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct] interesting?

**Devotee:**
I have no idea. [indistinct]

[indistinct back ground talking] [break]

**Guru dāsa:**
There’s many students they don’t know how to extract intelligently what to say. For instance the day before this incident I said to Viṣṇujana, you are speaking about becoming like fire. If the guru vaisnavas[?] in any way attack, so that was the grounds.

Similarly when Sudāmā Vipra came back from..., when Mahārāja came back from Aligarh you didn’t discourage him. So they thought that perhaps they could always attack as a general rule. So [break] Godbrothers have said Śrīla Prabhupāda sometimes appears angry? So I said so he also sometimes appears compassionate, why do you forget that nature? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
These fools they do not understand. [break] ...by the Vaiṣṇavas that’s a fact but one must know how to attack and when to attack. I also attack against the Māyāvādīs. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also attacked, my Guru Mahārāja also attacked. So attack must be done very intelligently. Don’t go to [indistinct].

**Guru dāsa:**
Mahāprabhu listened for seven days? [break] then He knew how to attack.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...that many Indians also joined with you and combinedly the preaching will go on. But somehow or other it is experienced that Indians will not [indistinct]. [break] ...join with you or circumstances will not allow them to join. In India if you try to preach without Indian cooperation it will not support. Because they will always criticise that these people have come to teach us and they will never perform. This is the position.

And the present circumstances [indistinct] that you cannot join [indistinct]. That Rādhā-ramaṇa Gosvāmī[indistinct] that [indistinct] left and so on. [break] [indistinct] to join [indistinct] so abominable so nobody will join. On the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness everyone will some join and work. That is a little difficult. The temple here if no Indians join then they will go away [indistinct] gradually Indians will be preachers. Unless you very carefully and intelligently they will be elevated. [break] the Indians and the Americans keep themselves in the bodily concept of life. [indistinct] means [indistinct] [break]

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? [indistinct] They’re lack[?]. They’re lack[?] bluffing means 8% interest [indistinct] more banking business. That means 80,000 per year, or 7,000 nearly 10,000 per month. If we draw, suppose we 10,000 lakhs...10 lakhs.

**Acyutānanda:**
10 lakhs.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means we are losing 7,000 per month. If you transaction 7,000 per month is that [indistinct]? Why should we draw so much? If we draw big amount there will be income.

**Śyāmasundara:**
In Vṛndāvana we have no preaching scope [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
No. No we wanted to receive some foreign guests so that they could see and our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to have no branch in Vṛndāvana that does not look very good. Kṛṣṇa’s place...

**Śyāmasundara:**
[indistinct] one reason that is the foreign tourists. They have a regular programme of foreign tourists coming. That hasn’t happened yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Śyāmasundara:**
That has not yet happened.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Śyāmasundara:**
But in future it could happen and they would be five years ahead of our [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]. Here the government is... [indistinct] people do not like [indistinct] Because you are there with Caitya Guru not very able but he stands for [indistinct]

[break] that is the problem. [indistinct] but you do not like. Always [indistinct]. So we must finish it that another attempt for Bharatpur I don’t think we can manage

[break] will be available so you should not mind but that is not also possible because Mahārāja is bargaining [indistinct] so why should we take care [indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
We will come there someday.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
Someday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Someday [laughs] [indistinct] utopian, someday. That Mahārāja is more intelligent than you could have understand.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yeah. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] [break].

[in room]

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
Lot of Germans. Or at least a percentage of Germans 40, 50%. But here we have centres that are already having 15 or 20 Western people. So the image is there are already if they are a Western organisation. So even in Europe we tend to attract more Americans than European people. Like in Germany we will attract more Americans than we will Germans, initially. But after a while the Germans come but usually the best success as far as attracting people seems to be when there is only two or three people left in the whole city. But when you have a large number of Americans [break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
I have noticed the most we’ve been travelling around the world, that in India the spiritual standard of the devotees is lower than in America part of the reason has been that the //sannyāsīs// who are supposed to be leaders of devotees have misunderstood that what their real duty is in India, in America we told them that the //sannyāsīs// duty is to maintain the highest spiritual standards among the devotees. They should always see to the devotees spiritual well-being and welfare. And here it seems to be the tendency that the //sannyāsīs// remain separate or aloof from the devotees.

You summed it up in four words to Satsvarūpa when you said, "just do as I am doing." Now that means administrating managing going to the bank, counting money, keeping accounts. Doing all the practical work as well but here for instance in a test case this Keśī Ghat temple. There was practically chaos there day and night there was no spiritual standards at all and the //sannyāsīs// seemed to remain aloof. They didn’t enter into the actual managing or administrating of the temple or organising it and as a result there was chaos throughout the town we made such a bad image.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Śyāmasundara:**
Because we have no spiritual standards.

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Śyāmasundara:**
No. I know I observed saw there was no standard or organisation. Not as we have in other places [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway, [indistinct] to say. //Sannyāsīs// should be leader.

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Śyāmasundara:**
That’s a fact.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
In other parts of the world the //sannyāsīs// may be accepted as leaders before... The other devotees there are new and they look to the //sannyāsīs// for guidance because they are the senior most members in that particular area who are not often enough present there so they have no one else to look to. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes //sannyāsīs// should take leadership and see that everything is nicely going on. That will be wanted. Actually //sannyāsīs// are topmost leaders they should see that they are chanting 16 rounds, rising early in the morning and they should also rise early, behave like that and if there is any discrepancy it should not be ended by fighting. If there is any discrepancy there should be very peaceful settlement. Not that because this man [indistinct] pain, let us fight. [indistinct] beating justified. Somebody has told me the beating was justified. [indistinct].

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
He beat that boy because that boy was physically attacking me to hurt me. If he did not stop him I would have been seriously hurt Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that’s all right, [indistinct] So why you are misunderstanding this now. [indistinct] That check, not that because he is coming I shall not kick, then where is my direction? I’m going to check that, not that I’ll also become demon-like. First have to stop...Stop the fighting between them when there was no ways to stop the fighting then war was declared. [break]

This has gone to the police we should not... we should be very careful. But Caitanya [break] //sannyāsīra alpa chidra bāhu kori mane,// if a //sannyāsī// commits something wrong it is magnified. If ordinary man does it nobody cares for it. But a //sannyāsī,// Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī// a preacher if he commits something even if it is not wrong it will be magnified, //alpa chidra bāhu kori mane.//

Therefore especially a //sannyāsī// because a //sannyāsī// is supposed to be the //guru,// the teacher of everyone. Even of the //brāhmaṇas.// How much qualified they should be? Super-most post in the human society according to Vedic principle. Any //sannyāsī// you should immediately offer obeisances, if he does not do so then he has to starve one day, fast that is the penance. He has not offered, you’ve seen? No [indistinct] will offer respects to a //sannyāsī.// That is Vedic culture. They should see everywhere that things are going on nicely. [end]
