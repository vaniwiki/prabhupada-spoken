**Pradyumna:**
[reading:] Page number 15. Uh. "In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...//" Uh. "In the Fifth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Sixth Chapter, eighteenth verse [[books:sb:5:6:18|[SB 5.6.18]]], Nārada also says to Yudhiṣṭhira, 'My dear King, it is Lord Kṛṣṇa, known as Mukunda, who is the eternal protector of the Pāṇḍavas and the Yadus. He is also your spiritual master and instructor in every respect.

"He is the only worshipable God for you. He is very dear and affectionate, and He is the director of all your activities, both individual and familial. And what's more, He sometimes carries out your orders as if He were your messenger! My dear King, how very fortunate you are, because for others all these favors given to you by the Supreme Lord would not even be dreamt of.'

"The purport of this verse is that the Lord easily offers liberation, but He rarely agrees to offer a soul devotional service, because by devotional service the Lord Himself becomes purchased by the devotee."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
“ 'The Happiness of Becoming One with the Supreme.' Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī says that if //brahmānanda,// or the happiness of becoming one with the Supreme, is multiplied by one trillionfold, still, it cannot be compared with an atomic fraction of the happiness derived from the ocean of devotional service.

"In the //Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya,// Prahlāda Mahārāja, while satisfying Lord Nṛsiṁha by his prayers, says, 'My dear Lord of the universe, I am feeling transcendental pleasure in Your presence and have become merged in the ocean of happiness. I now consider the happiness of //brahmānanda// to be no more than the water in the impression left by a cow's hoof in the earth, compared to this ocean of bliss.'

"Similarly, it is confirmed in the //Bhāvārtha-dīpikā,// Śrīdhara Swami's commentary on the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:// 'My dear Lord, some of the fortunate persons who are swimming in the ocean of Your nectar of devotion, and who are relishing the nectar of the narration of Your pastimes, certainly know ecstasies which immediately minimize the value of the happiness derived from religiousness, economic development, sense gratification and liberation. Such a transcendental devotee regards any kind of happiness other than devotional service as no better than straw in the street.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
“ 'Attracting Kṛṣṇa.' Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has stated that devotional service at..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Any..., any question arises, you can ask.

**Pradyumna:**
"Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has stated that devotional service attracts even Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa attracts everyone, but devotional service attracts Kṛṣṇa. The symbol of devotional service in the highest degree is Rādhārāṇī. Kṛṣṇa is called Madana-mohana, which means that He is so attractive that He can defeat the attraction of thousands of Cupids. But Rādhārāṇī is still more attractive, for She can even attract Kṛṣṇa. Therefore devotees call Her //madana-mohana-mohinī,// the attractor of the attractor of Cupid. To perform devotional service means to follow in the footsteps of Rādhārāṇī..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Madana-mohana. Madana-mohana... //Madana// means sex attraction. //Madana,// sex attraction, Cupid, and Kṛṣṇa is called Madana-mohana. One can, I mean, neglect even sex attraction if one is attracted to Kṛṣṇa. That is the test. //Madana// [is] attracting in this material world. Everyone is attracted by sex life. The whole material world is existing on sex life. This is the fact. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-suhkhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Here, the happiness, the so-called happiness is //maithuna, maithunādi. Maithunādi// means here happiness begins from //maithuna,// sex intercourse.

Generally, people..., a man marries. The purpose is to satisfy sex desire. Then he begets children. Then again, when the children are grown up, they..., the daughter is married with another boy and the boy is married with another daughter, another girl. That is also the same purpose: sex. Then again, grandchildren. In this way, this material happiness---//śriyaiśvarya-prajepsavaḥ.// The other day we discussed, //śrī// means beauty, //aiśvarya// means wealth and //prajā// means generation.

So generally, people, they like it---good family, good bank balance and good wife, good daughter, daughter-in-law. If one family is consisting of beautiful woman and riches and grea..., many children, he is supposed to be successful. He's supposed to be most successful man. So //śāstra// says, "What is this success? This success is beginning with sex intercourse. That's all. And maintaining them."

So //yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham.// Here the happiness begins from sex life, //maithunādi.// We may polish it in a different way, but this //maithuna,// sex life happiness, is there in the hogs. The hogs also, they are eating whole day, here and there: "Where is stool? Where is stool?" and having sex life without any discrimination. The hogs do not discriminate whether mother, sister or daughter.

So therefore //śāstra// says, "Here, this material world, we are entangled. We are encaged in this material world only for this sex life." That is Cupid. Cupid is the god of sex life, Madana. Unless one is, what is called, induced by Madana, the Cupid, he cannot be, I mean to say, engladdened in sex life. And Kṛṣṇa's name is Mādana-mohana. //Mādana-mohana// means that one who is attracted to Kṛṣṇa, he'll forget the pleasure derived from sex life. This is the test. Therefore His name is Mādana-mohana. Here is Mādana-mohana. Sanātana Gosvāmī worshiped Mādana-mohana. //Madana// or //Mādana. Mādana// means to become mad. And Madana, the Cupid.

So everyone is infuriated by the force of sex life. There are many places... In //Bhāgavatam// it is said, //puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etat tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim āhur// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. The whole material world is going on: the man is attracted by woman, the woman is attracted by man. And seeking this attraction, when they are united, their attachment for this material world become more and more.

And in this way, after being united, or after being married, one woman and man, they seek nice home, //gṛha; kṣetra,// activities, business, factory or agricultural field. Because one has to earn money. So get food. //Gṛha-kṣetra; suta,// children; and //āpta,// friends; //vitta,// wealth... //Ataḥ gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair janasya moho 'yam// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. The attraction for this material world becomes more and more tight. This is called //madana,// attraction by //madana.//

But our business is not to be attracted by the glimmer of this material world, but to be attracted by Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Unless you become attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, we must have to be satisfied by the beauty of..., this false beauty of this material world. Therefore Śrī Yamunācārya said that //yadāvadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor nava-nava-dhāma rantum āsīt:// "So long I have been attracted by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa and I have begun to serve at His lotus feet, and I am getting newer, newer energy, since then, as soon as I think of sex intercourse, I want to spite on it."

That is //vitṛṣṇā,// no more attraction. The central point of attraction of this material world is sex life, and one..., when one gets detached from sex life... //Tadāvadhi mama cetaḥ...,//

> yadāvadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor
> nava-nava-[rasa-]dhām[anudyata] rantum āsīt
> tadāvadhi bata nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne
> bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca
> [Śrīla Yāmunācārya]

"As soon as I think of sex intercourse, immediately my mouth becomes turned aside and I want to spite on it."

So therefore Kṛṣṇa is Madana-mohana. //Madana// is attracting everyone, sex life, and Kṛṣṇa, when one is attracted by Kṛṣṇa, then //madana// also becomes defeated. So as soon as //madana// becomes defeated, we conquer over this material world. Otherwise it is very difficult.

The... //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. //Duratyayā// means very, very difficult. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti.// But if anyone surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa, catches His lotus feet very strongly, "Kṛṣṇa, save me," Kṛṣṇa promises, "Yes, I'll save you." //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "Don't worry. I shall save you." //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]: "My dear Arjuna, you can declare to the world, My devotee, pure devotee, //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ// [Brs. 1.1.11], who has no other desire, he'll be protected by Me."

So people do not know that our only business is to take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. That is the only business. We have no other business. Any other business means we are becoming entangled in this material world. And the aim of human life is to get out of these clutches of material world. People do not know it. They do not know. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]].

So it is very difficult; still, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order to distribute this knowledge all over the world. So let us try. Even the people do not take our instruction, that is not our disqualification. Our qualification is let us try our best. The //māyā// is very strong. To take the living entities out of the clutches of //māyā// is not very easy thing. My Guru Mahārāja used to say... He had so many temples all over India, and he used to say some time that "If by selling all these properties, temples, if I could turn one man to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then my mission will be successful." He used to say that.

So our purpose is not to construct big, big buildings. That is required for propaganda work, for giving shelter to people. But our main business is how to turn the face of the bewildered conditioned soul towards Kṛṣṇa. That is our method. That is our main purpose. Therefore, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura and other Vaiṣṇavas, they did not advise to give much attention for constructing big, big temples and //maṭhas.//

Because if our attention is diverted towards these material things... Material things means, as I have repeatedly explained, forgetful of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise there is no..., nothing material. It is illusion. Illusion means actually there is nothing material. How it can be material? If the Supreme Lord is Supreme Spirit, everything is coming from Him, so what we call the material energy, that is also coming from the Supreme.

But the difficulty is that in this inferior energy... Inferior energy means where there is possibility of forgetting Kṛṣṇa. Actually, that is the fact. People are engaged in so many activities. We can see it very nicely in the Western countries. They are inventing so many modern facilities. But the result is they're forgetting Kṛṣṇa. That is material. Material means forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, there is nothing except Kṛṣṇa.

//Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ.// Prahlāda Mahārāja..., yes, Nārada Mahārāja said that "This world is Kṛṣṇa." //Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ.// "But it appears like that it is different from Bhagavān." Actually, there is... For a //mahā-bhāgavata,// he has no such conception, material conception, because he sees everywhere Kṛṣṇa. //Sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhe nā dekhe tāra mūrti// [[books:cc:madhya:8:274|[Cc. Madhya 8.274]]].

He's seeing one tree, but he is..., he's forgetful of the tree; he's seeing energy of Kṛṣṇa. As soon as he sees the energy of Kṛṣṇa, he sees Kṛṣṇa. Therefore instead of seeing the tree, he sees Kṛṣṇa. Because one after, after, coming, reference to the context. As soon as he sees anything we call material, he sees this is the conversion of the energy. //Pariṇāma-vāda. Sarvedam akhilaṁ jagat. Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ.//

//Parasya bra...// Just like as soon as you see the sunshine, you see immediately sun. Is it not? In the morning, as soon as you see within your window the sunshine, immediately you remember sun and you are confident sun is there. Without sun, how there can be sunshine? Similarly, whatever we see, if we immediately see Kṛṣṇa with reference to that particular thing... Because that particular thing is the manifestation of the energy of Kṛṣṇa.

So those who have understood Kṛṣṇa along with His energies, he sees the energy, because energy is not different from the energetic. He sees immediately Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he does not see anything except Kṛṣṇa. So therefore, for him there is no material world. There is no material world. To a perfect devotee, there is no material world. Everything is spiritual. //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.// He sees everything Brahman.

So we have to make our eyes to see Kṛṣṇa. //Tat-paratvena nirmalam.//

> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

//Tat-paratvena.// As soon as we are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, our seeing, touching, smelling---everything become //nirmala,// purified. Then we can immediately see Kṛṣṇa. These eyes, so long it is not purified, we cannot see Kṛṣṇa. As soon as it is purified, you see Kṛṣṇa, nothing but Kṛṣṇa. So this is the process. So devotional service means purification.

> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

> sarvopādhi-vinirmu..., anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

So Cupid, Cupid is one of the agent of this material, illusory energy, but if we are perfectly in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this Cupid cannot pierce with our arrows..., with his arrows. That is not possible. As Yamunācārya says, that //tadāvadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-pa..., yadāvadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravinda...//

So to a devotee... Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura. You know the story of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was young man, and the Māyā, and a prostitute, they came, young prostitute, nicely dressed, and proposed her desire. Haridāsa Ṭhākura said, "Yes, please sit down. I shall fulfill your desire. Let me finish my chanting." Just see. At dead of night, a young man, Haridāsa Ṭhākura; in front, there is a beautiful young girl; there is nobody else, and she's proposing. But still, he's steady, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. So Cupid cannot pierce. This is the example.

There may be thousands of beautiful women before a devotee, but that does not disturb his mind. He sees they're all energies of Kṛṣṇa. "They are //gopīs// of Kṛṣṇa. They are enjoyable by Kṛṣṇa. I have to serve them. They're //gopīs.// Because I am servant of the servant." //Gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayoḥ dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. So a devotee should try to engage all beautiful women in the service of Kṛṣṇa. That is his duty. Not to enjoy them. That is sense gratification.

This is the position of a devotee. He's not pierced by the arrows of Cupid, but he sees everything, //nirbandhe kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.// He sees everything in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. //Yukta-vairāgyam ucyate.// That is //vairāgya.// He does not accept anything for his sense gratification, but he engages everyone in the service of Kṛṣṇa. Then we can get out of the influence of the arrow of Cupid. This is the process.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"To perform devotional service means to follow in the footsteps of Rādhārāṇī, and devotees in Vṛndāvana put themselves under the care of Rādhārāṇī in order to achieve perfection in their devotional service. In other words, devotional service is not an activity of the material world; it is directly under the control of Rādhārāṇī.

"In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is confirmed that the //mahātmās,// or great souls, are under the protection of //daivī prakṛti,// the internal energy---Rādhārāṇī. So, being directly under the control of the internal potency of Kṛṣṇa, devotional service attracts even Kṛṣṇa Himself."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ, bhajanty ananya-manaso// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. Here we are under the influence of this material energy, but those who are devotee of Kṛṣṇa, they are under the influence of internal energy. The internal energy of Kṛṣṇa, it has got three different functions. One of the function is //hlādinī śakti.// That is Rādhārāṇī. That is Rādhārāṇī. Rādhārāṇī is the pleasure potency of Kṛṣṇa.

> rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād
> ekātmānāv api [bhuvi purā] deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau
> śrī-caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptam...
> [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]

Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is... That is the version of Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara, that "Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, They are one, Kṛṣṇa." When Kṛṣṇa wants to enjoy, He manifests His energy. That is Rādhārāṇī. Kṛṣṇa cannot enjoy the material energy; He enjoys the internal energy. Kṛṣṇa has got many energies. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate, svābhāvakī-jñāna-bala-kriyā ca// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya// 13.65, //purport//]. That is the Vedic version, that the Supreme Absolute Truth has got multi-energies, and by utilizing, manipulating that energy, He is manifesting Himself in so many ways.

The same example: just like the sun, by expanding its energy, heat and light, is perceived. The sun is 93,000,000 miles away from us. So how we can understand the sun? By his heat and energy. By his heat, we can calculate what is the actual temperature. The scientists are calculating the actual temperature of the sun. So similarly, although Kṛṣṇa is far, far away from us... //Goloka eva nivasati.// He's residing in His abode, Goloka, Vṛndāvana. This is the replica of that Vṛndāvana.

So //akhilātma-bhūtaḥ.// How He's //akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]? How He's all-pervading? By His energy. By His energy. Just like Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā: mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagat avyakta-mūrtinā// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. That energy is //avyakta,// impersonal. But Kṛṣṇa is not impersonal. Kṛṣṇa is person. Just like the sun-god, he's a person, but his energy, sunshine and heat, that is impersonal. To reach impersonal feature of the sun or the sunshine is not approaching the sun. It is approaching and not approaching. It is approaching in the sense that directly in touch with his energy, but still, the sun globe and the sun-god is far away.

Similarly, //brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. To approach the impersonal feature of Brahman is not sufficient. We have to approach Kṛṣṇa. So the Rādhārāṇī, the personal... His energy is also personal. So //mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. If we take shelter of His external energy, where forgetfulness [of] Kṛṣṇa is very prominent, then we become far and far away from Kṛṣṇa. But if we take shelter of the internal energy of Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī, because She's directly serving Kṛṣṇa...

Just like in Vṛndāvana, they always speak of Rādhārāṇī because they have taken shelter of Rādhārāṇī to approach Kṛṣṇa very easily. //Daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ.// The facility of Vṛndāvana is that you take shelter of Rādhārāṇī directly, and She will help you to approach Kṛṣṇa very soon. This is the idea of coming to Vṛndāvana.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"This fact is corroborated by Kṛṣṇa in the Eleventh Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Twelfth Chapter, first verse [SB 11.12.1], where He says, 'My dear Uddhava, you may know it from Me that the attraction I feel for devotional service rendered by My devotees is not to be attained even by the performance of mystic //yoga,// philosophical speculation, ritualistic sacrifices, the study of //Vedānta,// the practice of severe austerities or the giving of everything in charity. These are, of course, very nice activities, but they are not as attractive to Me as the transcendental loving service rendered by My devotees.'

"How Kṛṣṇa becomes attracted by the devotional service of His devotees is described by Nārada in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Seventh Canto, Tenth Chapter, thirty-seventh verse [[books:sb:7:10:37|[SB 7.10.37]]]. There Nārada addresses King Yudhiṣṭhira while the King is appreciating the glories of the character of Prahlāda Mahārāja. A devotee always appreciates the qualities of other devotees."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is the sign of devotee: appreciation [of] the activities of devotee. This appreciation means a devotee who is actually freed from all contamination, he does not find any fault with other devotee. That is the sign. He does not think himself that he is bigger devotee or greater devotee than others. He thinks himself as the lowest of all. As Caitanya..., as //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// author, Kavirāja Gosvāmī, says, //purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se lagiṣṭha// [[books:cc:adi:5:205|[Cc. Ādi 5.205]]]: "I am lower than the insect within the stool." //Jagāi-mādhāi haite se muñi pāpiṣṭha:// "I am greater sinner than Jagāi and Mādhāi." //Mora nāma yei laya tāra puṇya kṣaya// [[books:cc:adi:5:206|[Cc. Ādi 5.206]]]: "Anyone who takes my name, immediately, all the result of his pious activities becomes vanquished." He's placing like that.

Because it is not imitation or any bluff. He's... Any devotee who's actually advanced, he feels like that. Just like great scientist Sir Isaac Newton, he used to say that "I have simply collected a few grains of sand in the ocean of knowledge." Yes. He used to say. And actually, that is the fact. Everything is unlimited. So nobody should be proud falsely that he has become a great devotee. Everyone should be very humble.

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

If one thinks that he has become very advanced in devotion, then that is very dangerous. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsana// [[books:cc:adi:7:71|[Cc. Ādi 7.71]]]: "My spiritual master saw Me a great fool. Therefore he has chastised Me, that 'Don't try to read the //Vedānta.// Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.' " He presented Himself like that. Is Caitanya Mahāprabhu //mūrkha?// But that is the conception, advanced devotee. They never think that they are very highly advanced devotee. What is advanced devotee? What devotion we can offer to Kṛṣṇa? He's unlimited. He's kindly accepting our little service. That's all. Don't be proud of becoming a great devotee. That is the cause of falldown.

Thank you very much.

**Devotee:**
