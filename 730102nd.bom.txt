====== The Nectar of Devotion ======

[audio distortion]

**Pradyumna:**
[reading] "The process of devotional service as it is recommended in //The Nectar of Devotion// will gradually elevate one from the material condition of life to the spiritual status, wherein the devotee becomes purified of all designations.

The senses can then become uncontaminated, being constantly in touch with //bhakti-rasa.// When the purified senses are employed in the service of the Lord, one becomes situated in //bhakti-rasa// life, and any action performed for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa in this transcendental //bhakti-rasa// stage of life ...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Yes.

**Pradyumna:**
... can be relished perpetually."

**Prabhupāda:**
So //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī is giving us the process how to elevate one's self from this material platform to the spiritual platform. That is devotional service. Devotional life means purifying the present conditional life, contaminated life, life under the influence of the three modes of material nature: //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// So if we become unaffected by these three //guṇas...// Just like it is recommended in the //Bhagavad-gītā, trai-guṇya-viṣayā vedā nistrai-guṇya bhavārjuna// [[books:bg:2:45|[Bg. 2.45]]].

One has to become above the three //guṇas---sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// In the material existence, the //sattva-guṇa// is considered to be first class, the //rajo-guṇa// is considered to be second class, and the //tamo-guṇa// is considered to be third class. But even if we remain in the //sattva-guṇa,// that is also not transcendental platform.

//Sattva-guṇa// means brahminical qualification: //satya śama dama titikṣa ārjava jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. These, these are the symptoms of //sattva-guṇa.// But //rajo-guṇa---tejo īśvara bhāvaś ca yuddhe cāpy apalāyanam.// Just like //kṣatriyas:// they're very powerful; they want to control; they are not afraid of fighting. These are //kṣatriya// qualifications. //Rajo-guṇa.// Creative power. They want to expand their kingdom, ruling over the people, taxing the people. These are the qualification of the //rajo-guṇa.// And //tamo-guṇa// means //śūdra:// ignorance and lazy. That is //tamo-guṇa.// These are the symptoms. They have no activity. They cannot become independent, because they are very lazy.

//Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,// they have their independent life, but the //śūdras,// they are dependent. Therefore //śūdra...// Just like a dog. A dog, if he has no master, it is street dog; it has no value. It must be chained by a very big master. That is his life. And he very voluntarily agrees: "Come here," "Yes." So //paricaryātmakaṁ kāryaṁ śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. //Paricaryā,// to satisfy the master.

So our this //bhakti// process is also the same. Sometimes we are criticized: "slave mentality." Yes, we want voluntarily to become slave---of Kṛṣṇa. We are, at the present moment, we are slave of the senses. //Kāma krodha lobha moho mātsarya. Kāmādi. Kāmādi// means //kāma,// desire to enjoy. And if our enjoyment, if our desire is not fulfilled, then we become //krodhi,// angry; //lobhi, moha mātsarya.// The material existence means we are servant of so many sense gratificatory processes. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. We are now engaged to act sinfully. Any kind of sinful activity we can accept. Why? //Yad indriya prītaya āpṛnoti.// Simply for sense gratification. That's all. We are prepared to take any risk only for sense gratification.

But we do not know that we are taking great risk, great risk. Because there is another life. After death, there is life. The modern people, they do not understand it. Therefore //śāstra// says, //na sādhu manye:// "These kind of activities are not very good." //Na sādhu.// It is not honest. This is not good. //Yato ātmano ayam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. We have got this body. That is //kleśada.// Just like we are feeling warm, therefore we want this fan, because the..., on account of this body, we are feeling warm, or sometimes chilly. So if I feel chilly, then I have to stop this fan. I'll have to cover this body. So all our pains and pleasure are due to this material body. That we do not understand. //Śāstra// says, //asann api.// Although this body's temporary, but it is //kleśada,// it is full of miserable condition: //ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika, ādhidaivika.//

So for our past //karma,// we have created this body and we are suffering. Therefore our mission should be not to create another body. And finish all sufferings in this body and do not create another material body. That is actually our duty. But we have no education. We have no information. Our leaders are blind, foolish. They are leading us to misuse this valuable life of human form. This is our position. They are misleading us.

//Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13]. They are impressing in us that "You are this body. You are born in this country. So your country, your nation is worshipable. Why you are after Kṛṣṇa? This is all bogus." This is our position. "Don't be after Kṛṣṇa. Just try to satisfy the senses of your body to the best capacity. Eat, drink, be merry and enjoy life. And next life? Oh, next life... That... Don't care." The atheist philosopher, Cārvāka Muni, says, //bhasmī-bhūtasya dehasya kuto punar āgamano bhavet:// "Don't care for next life." This is going on now: atheism. Big, big professors, educationists, they're also in this opinion. I have traveled all over the world. One Russian professor said, "Swāmījī, after this life, there is no... Everything is finished." But that's not the fact. That is the defect of modern education. There is life. There is life. Otherwise why there are so many varieties of life? We should consider that.

So //bhakti, bhakti// means to go back to home, back to Godhead. That is //bhakti. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. To understand Kṛṣṇa in truth, that is //bhakti.// Or by //bhakti,// by devotional service, you can understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa cannot be understand..., understood by //karma, jñāna, yoga.// Partially they can understand, but not fully. //Karma, jñāna...// Therefore Kṛṣṇa especially mentions, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. //Na karmaṇā na jñānena na yogena. Nāhaṁ vasāmi vaikuṇṭhe yoginaṁ hṛdayeṣu. Yoga// process or //jñāna// process can elevate... Of course, we become... The Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends that out of millions of //karmīs,// one //jñānī// is first class, because he understands things as they are, that "I am not this body. I am Brahman. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.//"

So therefore he's better than millions of //karmīs// who are simply working like an ass and dogs. They do not know what is the ultimate goal of life. They do not know what is the next life, what is the aim of life. They do not know. They are simply working for sense gratification. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. And doing all kinds of sinful activities. //Yad indriya-prītaya.// The only aim is how to satisfy senses. That is //karmī.//

So out of such millions of fools who are working hard... They have been described just like asses. The asses work very hard for the //dhobī,// for the washerman, not for himself. He does not work for himself. Therefore the //karmīs// are called asses, //mūḍhāḥ.// The ass is satisfied with a morsel of grass and working very hard for the washerman. This is ass's qualification. The //śāstras,// they have selected some animals: //śva-viḍ-varāha-uṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:19|[SB 2.3.19]]].

The... Generally, population, general population, they are just like dogs, //śva; viḍ-varāha,// the stool-eater, hog. //Śva-viḍ-varāha-uṣṭra,// camel. And //kharaḥ,// and ass. They have been selected. So... Just like... Why they are compared with the dog? Because the dog is searching after a master. Without master, he cannot live.

So those who cannot live independently, they are just like dogs. There are so many things, explanation. //Viḍ-varāha. Viḍ-varāha// means no distinction of eating. Anything. Any damn thing, any nonsense thing, up to stool, they can eat. They are..., they are called //viḍ-varāha.// And //uṣṭra. Uṣṭra// means that he's eating his own blood, thorny twigs. The //uṣṭra,// you know, the //kharaiḥ,// I mean, the camel, in the desert there is only thorny twigs. Because there are //uṣṭras...//

There is no other animal. And there are some date trees also, for the human being. Kṛṣṇa has provided everything. //Eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. Even in the desert Kṛṣṇa has provided food. So this //uṣṭra,// this camel, they like to eat these twigs, thorny twigs. And as soon as they chew the thorny twig, blood oozes out from the tongue, and it is mixed, and it makes a nice taste. So he's thinking that twigs are very nice, these thorns are very nice.

Similarly, this material existence, it is simply thorny life. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām.// Every step. Here is our friend, Mr. Cakravartī. He was going to business, and immediately there was accident. The whole thing became turned into something else. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām.// We do not understand this, that every step there is danger. This material life is so dangerous. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām. Na teṣām,// who are they? Who do not face this //padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām. Samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ. Puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ mahat-padam.// One who has taken shelter. //Bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ paraṁ padaṁ padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām// [SB 10.14.58].

So the //bhakti, bhakti// cult... Everyone should take. Because that is natural. Natural. //Nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti. Bhakti's// not unnatural. Other things unnatural. That is the statement of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. Eternally you are servant of Kṛṣṇa. But we have accepted the service of //māyā// instead of Kṛṣṇa. And we are thinking we are independent. We are being kicked out every moment by //māyā,// and still I am thinking, "I'm God. I'm independent" This is called illusion. He's being slapped always, he's being kicked by //māyā;// still he's thinking that he's independent, he's God, he's big, he's minister, he is something, something, something. This is called //māyā. Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This is called //moha.// So //bhakti// means to become freed from this //moha,// illusion. That is //bhakti.//

So //dharma-artha-kāma-mokṣa// ([[books:sb:4:8:41|SB 4.8.41]], [[books:cc:adi:1:90|Cc. Ādi 1.90]]). People are after these four things. //Dharma. Dharma,// generally, they try to become religious for some material gain, //artha.// Material gain. And why //artha// is required? Because //kāma,// to fulfill our desires, for lusty desires. We require money. //Dharma-artha-kāma.// And when we are frustrated in enjoying this material world, then we try to become //mokṣa,// merge into the existence of Brahman, //brahmā satyaṁ jagan mithyā,// when you are frustrated. So that kind of //mokṣa...// Of course, it is nice. But //bhakti// is beyond //mokṣa. Mokṣa// means //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// to understand that "I am Brahman." That is //mokṣa.// That is //mukti.// "I'm not this matter. I'm not this body." That is called //mokṣa.//

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

After being liberated from this material contamination, that //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// "I am not this matter; I am Brahman..." That is called //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage. In the //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage one is joyful, //prasannātmā.// That is the symptoms of //brahma-bhūtaḥ. Prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. //Na śocati na kāṅkṣati.//

Because he has nothing to do with material world, therefore sometimes it is said, "It is //mithyā,//" because I have nothing to do. It may be very important thing, but unless you realize Kṛṣṇa, //mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām,// by devotional service, even by lifting yourself to that stage, transcendental stage of Brahman realization, there is chance of falling down. That is the verdict of, I mean to say, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ 
> patanty adhaḥ anādṛtaḥ-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ 
> [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]].

Because they could not search out the shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, they have to come down again to this material existence, which they left as //mithyā.// But their..., because there is no shelter on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, this //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage also not secure. One has to fall down. We have seen many big, big //sannyāsīs,// very learned scholars, //sannyāsīs,// they take part in politics, sociology. Because they could not catch up real Brahman, therefore they come again to this material existence.

So Śrīdhara Swami, the great commenter on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// he says, in connection with the second verse, First Chapter, First Canto:

> dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ 
> vāstava vastu vedyam atra ...
> [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]].

So Śrīdhara Swami says, //atra mokṣavisandi api nirastam:// to desire for //mokṣa// is also not ultimate goal of life. Ultimate goal of life is to accept the shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. Actually who is //jñānavān,// he'll take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. If not in this life, he'll have to come to this status. Therefore //nirviśeṣavadi,// impersonalists... Kṛṣṇa says, //kleṣaḥ adhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta cetasām. Avyakta.// Kṛṣṇa is //vyakta.// But one who is not after this //vyakta,// he's after impersonal Brahman, their labor is still more hard than the //bhaktas.//

So the //bhakti-mārga// means directly giving you the ultimate goal of life---Viṣṇu. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇu.// People do not know that what is the aim of life. The aim of life is to go back to home, back to Godhead. That is the aim of life. But they have no information. There is God. "Who is God? Who is Viṣṇu?" No information. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. So without understanding Viṣṇu, without understanding Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all other attempts, they are not successful. That is the verdict of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ.//

Without understanding Kṛṣṇa, if one is thinking that "I have become liberated," that is //vimukta-maninaḥ.// He's thinking like that. Actually he's under the clutches of //māyā.// He's thinking like that. Why? //Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.// Because his intelligence is not yet clear. Still it is contaminated by //māyā.// Therefore //āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ anādṛtaḥ-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa.// The..., they take too much hardship for rising to the Brahman platform, //nirviśeṣa// Brahman platform. //Kṛccha sādhana.// Their austerities, penances are very severe. Taking shelter underneath a..., as Śaṅkarācārya exhibited himself: he was living underneath a tree, thrice, four times taking bath. Very cutting //vairāgya. Āruhya kṛcchreṇa.// But if they do not approach Kṛṣṇa, then there is chance of falling down. There is chance of falling down again into this material world.

Because we are living entities, we want variety. As I have explained several times, just like if you go in the sky... The sky is very brilliant, all shining, but still you'll not like it. You'll come down. You'll want to come down again, because you want variety. So if you go very high in the sky, if you actually enter into some planet where there is varieties of life, then you become satisfied. Otherwise, if you remain only in the sky, //nirviśeṣa, nirākāra,// then you'll hanker after: "Where is //viśeṣa?// Where is varieties? Where is variety?" This is natural. Therefore //śāstra// says, //āruhya kṛcchreṇa param...//

You can go very high with your aero..., aeroplane, but if you don't get any shelter in the sky, then you'll have to come back. As they are doing. They're trying to go to the moon planet, not in the sky. The sky, you can remain in the sky. Why you are coming back? No, that is not very pleasing. That is not very pleasing.

So //bhakti-mārga// means that //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. You can understand Kṛṣṇa as He is. "As He is" means He's not a human being like you or me. He's the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //sac-cid-ānanda vigraha.//

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

That is understanding of Kṛṣṇa. If we understand Kṛṣṇa as ordinary human being, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]], then we don't understand Kṛṣṇa. We understand Kṛṣṇa's //māyā,// not Kṛṣṇa. //Nāhaṁ sarvasya prakāṣaḥ yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa cannot be understood, because He's covered by //yogamāyā.// He can be understood only by the devotees.

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena

> yam śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.38]

So the //bhakti-mārga// means we want real life, eternal life, and varieties also. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. //Ānanda// cannot... Variety is the mother of enjoyment. Without variety, you cannot feel enjoyment. That is not possible. Suppose if I simply give you a lump of flour. Will you enjoy? But the same flour, you make //kachorīs, siṅgāra, lucī, purī// and this and... Oh, you'll enjoy. The ingredient is the same, but when it is variety, it is enjoyable. Similarly, spiritual varieties... The impersonalists, they being fed up with this material varieties, they want to make it zero. But that will not help us. In zero we cannot be happy, because we are, by nature, we want to enjoy. Enjoy means there must be varieties. The same flour, but you pick up some different varieties of flour and keep it, oh, you'll enjoy: "Oh, it is very nice." Therefore Kṛṣṇa has given so many varieties.

So the varieties of life. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis// [Bs. 5.37]. //Ānanda-cinmaya.// These varieties, this is material variety. We cannot enjoy here, but there is spiritual variety. That is //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ.// Just like Kṛṣṇa Himself is expanding Himself as //gopīs,// as cowherds boys, as calves and cows and trees in Vṛndāvana. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis.// They are all //ananda-cinmaya-rasa,// expansion of Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. //Rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. So we want liberation, but not liberation in the impersonal existence. That is... That is not very safe. We must enter into the spiritual varieties of life. That is Kṛṣṇaloka; that is Vaikuṇṭhaloka, especially Kṛṣṇaloka. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. He's Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. His body is not like us. He is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.// But He has got form.

So Brahman realization means partial understanding of the //sat// portion of //sac-cid-ānanda.// Paramātmā realization means realization of //para,// of the //cit// potency. But //ānanda// realization means to become associated with Kṛṣṇa. That is //ānanda,// varieties, //rāsa-līlā.// Kṛṣṇa is playing with the cowherds boys, Kṛṣṇa is dancing with the //gopīs,// Kṛṣṇa is enjoying the association of His mother, His father, His friend. //Itthaṁ brahma-sukhānubhūtyā dāsyaṁ gatānāṁ para-daivatena// [[books:sb:10:12:7-11|[SB 10.12.11]]]. The Kṛṣṇa is the origin of Brahman effulgence. Those who are trying for //brahma-sukha,// here is the point. Śukadeva Gosvāmī: //itthaṁ brahma-sukhānubhūtyā.// The origin. //Brahmano 'haṁ pratiṣṭhā.// "Impersonal Brahman is situated on Me." //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi// [Bs. 5.40]. So we get information.

We have to realize these things, what is Kṛṣṇa. That...

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām apisiddhānāṁ
> kaścin vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

To understand Kṛṣṇa is not very easy thing. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu.// Out of many, many millions who are trying to become successful in the mission of life... //Manuṣyāṇāṁ saha, kaścid yatati siddhaye. Siddhaye. Siddhaye// means, to become //siddha// means to become //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// to understand that "I am not this material body. I am //brahmāsmi.//" That is //siddhi.// And //yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]: out of many such //siddhas// who have realized Paramātmā or Brahman, out of many such millions of people, one can understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is so difficult subject matter.

But He's so kind also that He is giving us instruction personally in the form of //Bhagavad-gītā// what He is. What He is? He says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "My dear Arjuna, don't labor hard, simply that there is something beyond Me." Sometimes they say that "There is still more, beyond Kṛṣṇa." But Kṛṣṇa says, "No, there is nothing beyond." //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya, mayi sūtre gaṇā iva:// "Everything is resting on Me." //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. The //Vedānta// says, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Janma sthiti laya,// where it is staying, where it is being conducted, that is Brahman. So Kṛṣṇa answers this question that //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. He's the Supreme Brahman. Therefore Arjuna accepted Him: //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. We are Brahmans, but we are not Param Brahman. Param Brahman is Kṛṣṇa. We are //ātmā,// but we are not Paramātmā. Paramātmā is Kṛṣṇa.

So in this way...

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti mām...
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

So in this way we have to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. We have to understand Kṛṣṇa through the //paramparā,// disciplic succession, not by our A-B-C-D knowledge. That is not possible. One has to accept the disciplic succession, line. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. That //guru... Guru// means Kṛṣṇa's representative, Kṛṣṇa's... //Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ<popup>. Sākṣād dharitvena.//

Because //guru// is representative of Kṛṣṇa, therefore he should be respected as good as Kṛṣṇa. //Kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.// But because a //guru// is respected as Kṛṣṇa, the //guru// does not think that he has become Kṛṣṇa. No. That is foolishness. He's the most confidential servant of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore... Just like most confidential secretary, he acts as the master. His signature, his settlement will be accepted by the master. Similarly, //yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo yasya prasādād na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.// We have to select the right representative of Kṛṣṇa and accept him as //guru.// And if I please him, then Kṛṣṇa will be pleased.

There is no need of... Somebody, they say that "Kṛṣṇa is not present. How shall I please Him?" No. Kṛṣṇa's representative is present. You please him. //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo, yasya. Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau// [//ŚU// 6.23]. This is the process. //Yathā deve tathā gurau. Tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante.// This is the process. //Ādau gurvāśrayam.// That is Gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī giving his..., in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, ādau gurvāśrayam.// If you are actually interested to understand Kṛṣṇa and //kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// the first business is //ādau gurvāśrayam:// you take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master who is representative of Kṛṣṇa.

And how we can understand the representative of Kṛṣṇa? That is not very difficult. Because what Kṛṣṇa says, if the representative says the same thing, then he's representative. It is not very difficult. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. If His representative says that "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa," he's representative. That's all. He does not become, himself, Kṛṣṇa. Then he's bogus. A faithful servant will never say that "I am the master." "I am servant"---although he's as good as the master. Similarly, a //guru// is //sākṣād dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva, kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.// He, he is the most confidential, dear servant of Kṛṣṇa. That is //guru.// That's all. He does not know anything but Kṛṣṇa.

Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu presenting Himself: //gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayoḥ dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. A //guru// is always the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa. He does not represent himself direct servant. How he can be direct servant? But if you are in the disciplic succession of the servitude, servant of the servant of the servant, //evaṁ paramparā-prāptam// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]], then you become representative. And there is no difference between the original //guru,// Kṛṣṇa, and the latest //guru// Kṛṣṇa. Because the aim is the same. Kṛṣṇa personally says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].

And who is representative of Kṛṣṇa, he'll say the same thing: "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa." Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. The //guru// will say, "Yes, you become always Kṛṣṇa conscious." //Man-manā.// Kṛṣṇa says //man-manā.// A //guru// says, "You become Kṛṣṇa conscious." The same thing. There is no difference. You become devotee of Kṛṣṇa. You always think of Kṛṣṇa. You always chant of Kṛṣṇa. You always speak of Kṛṣṇa. You do not know anything but Kṛṣṇa. Simply this life is required.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching people to become Kṛṣṇa..., Kṛṣṇa conscious. Means Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru.// The four things. You just become always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. You just become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. You just offer your obeisances unto Kṛṣṇa. And you just worship Kṛṣṇa. And accept Kṛṣṇa, giving up any other engagement. Because real //dharma// is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]? Why He says, "Give up all other so-called //dharmas//"? They are not //dharmas.// And the //Bhāgavata// says, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]: "The cheating type of //dharma// is kicked out from this //Bhāgavatam.//" Cheating type. Real //dharma,// what is that real //dharma? Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. What Bhagavān says. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is real //dharma.//

So we request everyone... It is very scientific. It is authorized. We are not talking nonsense. Authorized. We are taking the version of Kṛṣṇa. We are taking the version of the Vedic conclusion. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. //Vedas,// study of //Veda// means to understand Kṛṣṇa. One who does not understand Kṛṣṇa, he's simply wasting his time.

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed ratiṁ yadi
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

You can execute your //dharma,// your occupational duty, very nicely. That's all right. But if you do not develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you are simply wasting your time and working hard for nothing. This is the verdict.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very genuine, and it is very easy. Especially in this age. That is also authorized statement of Śukadeva Gosvāmī: //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet// [SB 12.3.51]. He has described... Because in this age---in this age is called Kali-yuga---there are so many impediments. People are fallen. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. They are disturbed. So many botheration. It is very difficult to realize Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But there is very short-cut way recommended: //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.// Simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare you become uncontaminated of this material contamination and thus, being freed from material contamination, you become eligible to go back to home, back to Godhead.

Thank you very much.
