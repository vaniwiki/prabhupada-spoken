**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. So //govindam ādi-puruṣam tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// These verses, //Brahma-saṁhitā,// it was composed by Lord Brahmā. Therefore in the Vedic literature, this, this is called //saṁhitā. Saṁhitā// means part of the Vedic literature. So Lord Brahmā is describing about Kṛṣṇa. There are some foolish question that "Kṛṣṇa appeared five thousand years ago. How He became God?" Actually, that is not the fact. In the //Brahma-saṁhitā,// Brahmā is describing means from the very creation. Brahmā is the first creature of this universe. So he has explained about Kṛṣṇa by his experience, by his realization.

In the //Vedānta-sūtra,// Kṛṣṇa is described, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]: the Supreme Person from whom everything has emanated. So that Kṛṣṇa has confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā, aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. //Devānām// means in the beginning there was Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara. And Kṛṣṇa is //ādi// of these //devas// also. //Aham ādir hi devānām. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo:// "Everything has emanated from Me."

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitaḥ
> [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]

So Kṛṣṇa is the //ādi-puruṣa.// In... Arjuna also confirms. After understanding //Bhagavad-gītā,// Arjuna also confirms:

> paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma
> pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān
> puruṣaṁ śāśvatam ādyam...
> [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]

//Ādyam:// the original person. Just like in our genealogical table, in each family there is a person who is the origin of the family---then his son, his son, his grandson, great-grandson. In this way, family expands. Similarly, this creation is from Kṛṣṇa. In the //catuh-ślokī Bhāgavata// also, //aham eva āsam agre// ([[books:sb:2:9:33|SB 2.9.33]]/[[books:sb:2:9:34|34]]/[[books:sb:2:9:35|35]]/[[books:sb:2:9:36|36]]): "I, I was present before the creation." Even Śaṅkarācārya, who is impersonalist, he also says, //nārāyaṇaḥ paro avyaktād:// "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, He is beyond this material creation." //Nārāyaṇaḥ paraḥ avyaktād. Avyaktād aṇḍa-sambhavaḥ.// From the //avyakta,// nonmanifested material //mahat-tattva,// this material creation has been..., become possible. And before the material creation, beyond the material creation, there is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,// Lord Brahmā is describing Kṛṣṇa in each verse: //govindam ādi-puruṣam tam ahaṁ bhajāmi. Govindam ādi-puruṣam.// He's the original person.

Kṛṣṇa also says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti, asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. There is no more //parā-tattva,// superior source, except Kṛṣṇa. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore..., we are trying to place before the civilized human society that the //ādi-puruṣa,// the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are searching after God. There are so many societies---theological society, theosophical society---they are searching after God. But here is God. Why don't you take reference from the Vedic literature? God's reference is there in the Vedic literatures, and God Himself appeared, and He explained Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// And God is accepted...

Not now; even when Kṛṣṇa was present, five thousand years ago, all great sages, saintly persons, great //ṛṣis,// they also accepted. Nārada, Devala, Vyāsa. When Arjuna, in the //Bhagavad-gītā...// It is explained in the Tenth Chapter. You know, all, Kṛṣṇa as //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. He, he is addressing Kṛṣṇa as person, //bhavān.// This //bhavān śabda,// this word is used, "person," not imperson. //Bhavān. Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān, puruṣam// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. He's not imperson. //Puruṣam. Puruṣam// means person. Not female also. //Puruṣam// means male. //Puruṣaṁ śāśvatam. Śāśvatam,// original; //ādyam,// the first. So in this way.

And Arjuna has also given reference that all the great sages... At that time, Vyāsadeva... Vyāsadeva is still present. So "Vyāsadeva accepts You, Nārada accepts You, and Asita, Devala, big, big, great sages accepts You. You are personally speaking, and I have realized that You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead." This is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is not manufactured, as nowadays it has become a fashion to manufacture God by votes. No. God is never manufactured. God is God. Not by mystic power one becomes God or by so-called meditation or magical arts. No. God is God. Nobody can become God. //Asama urdhva.//

In the //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa is described as //asama urdhva prapitāmaha ca// [[books:bg:11:39|[Bg. 11.39]]]. In the Eleventh Chapter, you'll find these words. //Prapitāmaha.// Because Brahmā is considered... He's called //pitāmaha,// because the father of the father. If you search out the genealogical table of this universe, especially of the human society, then you go on searching. I am begotten by my father; my father is begotten by his father, his father, his father, his father---you go on. Then ultimately, if you have so much patience to make research, the..., you can get from the //śāstras.// You can get.

So the original father of this universe is Lord Brahmā; therefore he is addressed as Pitāmaha. But the father of Brahmā also, Brahmā, is also there: Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. The Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is expansion of Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, the original Viṣṇu, and Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is expansion of Saṅkarṣaṇa. Saṅkarṣaṇa is expansion of Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa is expansion of another Saṅkarṣaṇa, and that Saṅkarṣaṇa is expansion of Baladeva. And Baladeva is expansion of Kṛṣṇa. You'll find in the //śāstras.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the original person. //Govindam ādi-puruṣam tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// It is not that some artist has manufactured a fashionable Kṛṣṇa, and we worship that. No. Kṛṣṇa's the original person. We find it, description, in the //Saṁhitās,// in the //Vedas,// in the //Ṛg Veda: oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ.// And the explanation of //Vedānta-sūtra, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// there it is explained: //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Because //Vedānta-sūtra// begins with this aphorism: //janmādy asya yataḥ.//

So //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the original explanation of //Vedānta-sūtra.// So in the //Vedānta-sūtra,// explanation of //Vedānta-sūtra, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// it is said,

> janmādy asya yataḥ anvayāt itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ
> tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye muhyanti yatra sūrayaḥ
> [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]

These descriptions are there. So //ādi-kavi, ādi-kavi// means Brahmā. Brahmā, //ādi-kavi.// So //tene brahma. Brahmā// means //śabda-brahman,// Vedic literature. So He instructed or imparted in the heart of Brahmā. Because when the creation was there, Brahmā was the only person, living entity, in the beginning. So the question may be that "How Brahmā learned Vedic knowledge?" That is explained: //tene brahma... Brahmā. Brahmā// means Vedic literature. //Śabda-brahman.// The information, the description of God, is also Brahman. Brahman is absolute. There is no difference between Brahman and the literature which is describing Brahman. The same thing: just like //Bhagavad-gītā// and Kṛṣṇa, there is no difference. //Bhagavad-gītā// is also Kṛṣṇa.

Otherwise why this book is worshiped since so..., for so long time, since five thousand years, unless the //Bhagavad-gītā// is Kṛṣṇa? There are so many literatures, books, are published nowadays. After one year, two years, three years---finished. Nobody cares for it. Nobody cares for it. Nobody reads for... Any literature you take in the history of the world, no literature can exist for five thousand years, repeatedly being read by many, many scholars, religionists and philosophers, all. Why? Because it is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa... There is no difference between //Bhagavad-gītā// and Bhagavān. //Śabda-brahman.//

So //Bhagavad-gītā// should not be taken as ordinary literature, that one can comment on it by so-called A-B-C-D knowledge. No. That is not possible. The fools and rascals, they try to comment on the //Bhagavad-gītā// by their A-B-C-D scholarship. That is not possible. It is //śabda-brahman.// It will be revealed to the person who has devotion to Kṛṣṇa. //Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve...// These are the Vedic instruction.

> yasya deve parā bhaktir
> yathā deve tathā gurau
> tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ
> prakāśante mahātmanaḥ
> [ŚU 6.23]

They becomes revealed. Therefore Vedic literatures are called revealed. It is not that I can understand by your A-B-C-D knowledge; I can purchase one //Bhagavad-gītā,// and because I have grammatical knowledge, I can understand. No. //Vedeṣu durlabha.// In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is said, //vedeṣu durlabha.// You go on studying all Vedic literature by your literary capacity or scholarship---//durlabha.// It is not possible. //Vedeṣu durlabha.//

Therefore there are so many persons, they are trying to interpret //Bhagavad-gītā// by their so-called scholarship, but nobody cares for them. They cannot turn even one person a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. This is a challenge. In your Bombay there are so many persons, they are explaining //Bhagavad-gītā// for so many years, but they could not turn even a single person a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. This is our challenge. But this //Bhagavad-gītā,// now it is being explained as it is, and thousands and thousands of Europeans and Americans, whose forefathers or family never knew the name of Kṛṣṇa, they are becoming devotees. This is the secret of success. But these foolish people, they do not know. They think that by interpreting //Bhagavad-gītā// by their so-called rascaldom knowledge, they can reveal //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is not possible. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa is not exposed to these foolish and rascals. Kṛṣṇa is never exposed. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. He's not so cheap thing that He'll be understood by these fools and rascals. It is not possible. Kṛṣṇa says, //nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yogamāyā-samā...// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]].

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

So if we want to understand Kṛṣṇa, then we have to follow. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. Kṛṣṇa says. And Kṛṣṇa says, //bhakto 'si priyo 'si rahasyam etad uttamam// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]. Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, "This science of God, //Bhagavad-gītā, kṛṣṇa-tattva...//" Caitanya Mahāprabhu said: //yei kṛṣṇa-tattva vetta sei guru haya// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]. //Guru// does not become. //Guru// is not so cheap thing. One must know what is //kṛṣṇa-tattva.// One must know what is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says also,

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

Nobody knows Kṛṣṇa. They may speculate by their so-called scholarship, A-B-C-D knowledge, but Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is not there. They cannot turn even a single man to become a Kṛṣṇa devotee. That is not possible. They can befool. That is described in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: śva-viḍ-varāha-uṣṭra kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.// The..., one who is not devotee, he is described as a //paśuḥ,// as an animal. And such animal is eulogized, glorified, by another animal. What are they? Now, dogs, camels, asses and hogs. //Śva-viḍ-varāha-uṣṭra kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.// These description is there.

Therefore if we want to understand Kṛṣṇa, we have to follow these //mahājana,// just like Brahmā. Brahmā is the original. There are... Who is //mahājana? Mahājana.// In India, a //mahājana// is accepted who can give you loan, money. He's called //mahājana.// Not that, that all... It is, it is a perverted word. But //mahājana// means a..., one who is pure devotee of the Lord. //Mahātmā// means who is pure devotee of the Lord. //Sādhu// means who is a devotee---not these street beggars. //Sādhu. Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ samyag vyavasito hi...// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. Who are they, //sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ?//

> api cet su-durācāro
> bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
> sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ...
> [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]

He's //sādhu.// Even if we find some discrepancies in the life of a devotee... Just like these Europeans, Americans. They're devotee. They are pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. How? They have no other desire. They simply want to satisfy their spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are pure devotee. They have no other business. They have sacrificed everything. They are coming from rich family, rich nation, educated, everything. There is no scarcity in their country. Everything's complete. But still, for Kṛṣṇa they have forsaken everything. That is pure devotion.

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanam bhaktir uttamām
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

Those who are trying to catch up here something, catch up here something, they have been described by Caitanya Mahāprabhu as //khaḍajāṭhiyā beṭā. Khaḍajāṭhiyā beṭā.// The //khaḍajāṭhiyā...// One, one of the devotee of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Mukunda, he was very, I mean, confidential devotee. His class friend also, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's. So he was going sometimes here, sometimes there, sometimes here, sometimes there.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu became very angry upon him and gave him the title //khaḍajāṭhiyā beṭā. Khaḍajāṭhiyā beṭā.// "Don't allow him to come here." He became so strict. So he was very sorry: "Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said not to come in His meeting." So he was asking other devotees that "I shall not be allowed?" So, "We can..., how we can allow you? Caitanya Mahāprabhu has forbidden." "So will you ask if there will be any time so that I can again come back?"

So some devotee inquired from Caitanya Mahāprabhu that "Mukunda is very sorry. You asked not to come. But he's asking whether there will be any day in future when he'll be allowed to come again." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "After three thousands of births. After three thousands of births, he'll be allowed to come in." So when Mukunda inquired, "Did you inquire from Caitanya Mahāprabhu this question?" he said, "Yes, but He has said after your three thousands of repeated births, you'll be allowed." So he began to dance. He began to dance: "Oh, then I'll be allowed some day. Never mind, three thousand births. Never mind three thousand births." So when this, this, this was informed to Caitanya Mahāprabhu that "He's dancing now because You have..., You'll allow him to come in after three thousands of births," so Caitanya Mahāprabhu became very pleased and asked him to bring him immediately. [laughter]

So if we want to actually learn this... Just like there must be //eka niṣṭha. Bhajanti mām ananya-bhāk.// That is the qualification. [break] ...Kṛṣṇa. If you want to know Kṛṣṇa, it is very easy. Don't divert your attention to anything. "No, I, I worship this demigod, I worship that demigod, I..." Then your knowledge is gone. That is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante anya-devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]. //Anya-devatāḥ:// "other demigods." //Devatāḥ// is Kṛṣṇa, but others, they're demigods.

> ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa āra saba bhṛtya
> yāre yaiche nācāya se taiche kare nṛtya
> [[books:cc:adi:5:142|[Cc. Ādi 5.142]]]

God is one, Kṛṣṇa. //Ekam evādvitīyam.// All others, they are servants. This is our conclusion. This is śāstric conclusion. //Eka brahma dvitīya...// Brahman cannot be two. Param-brahman. //Paraṁ brahma paramaṁ bhavān.// Therefore Arjuna has addressed Him as //bhavān,// "Yourself." Not that "You have got many competitors." Just like we are, we find nowadays, in one street another God, another God; in another street, another God; another street, or another city. There are so many Gods. No. God is one. //Ekam eva advitīya.// And that is Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]].

So this is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So if we want to learn about Kṛṣṇa, then we have to follow the path of //mahājanas,// great personalities. Just like Brahmā is presenting //Brahma-saṁhitā,// describing; Vyāsadeva is presenting //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// Bhagavān, Himself, is describing Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So where is the difficulty to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// or Bhagavān? We don't find any difficulty. Where is the difficulty?

The //mahājana// is there, the //śāstra// is there, the //guru// is there, the //Veda// is there. And why should we make research after God? What is this nonsense? Everything is there. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. The purpose of //Vedas// is to know Kṛṣṇa. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā,// to inquire about Brahman. Brahman. So there is no need of searching out God. You can simply try to digest whatever is already there. The //Bhagavad-gītā// is there. All the //ācāryas,// they have accepted. They have written commentation on //Bhagavad-gītā// with reference to the Vedic knowledge. The Absolute---//kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam//---is accepted everywhere, by all //ācāryas.// Why you are searching after God? I do not know.

So this //Bhagavad-gītā// and this //Brahma-saṁhitā,// and the description is about Kṛṣṇa and His abode:

> advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam
> ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca
> vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.33]

//Advaita. Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam.// He has got //ananta-rūpam.// There is no limit, He has got so many. Because each..., in each and every //brahmāṇḍa// there is Kṛṣṇa //avatāra.// Kṛṣṇa //avatāra...// Just like in this //brahmāṇḍa// there was Kṛṣṇa //avatāra// in..., five thousand years ago, similarly Kṛṣṇa //avatāra// is going on just like... The same example as I have given you many times, that the sun, sun, sun planet is there in the sky, but sun is visible when he is in our front. Otherwise sun is there. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is always there, but when He descends, incarnates, He becomes visible to us, exactly like the sun. At the present moment, it is night. Sun is not visible. But in due course of time, say after eight hours or ten hours, in the morning, the sun will be visible.

Similarly, there is scheduled time when Kṛṣṇa becomes visible on this planet, on this universe. And there are, there are innumerable universes. They..., therefore He's called //nitya-līlā. Nitya-līlā// means eternal pastime. Kṛṣṇa is born as Yaśodā..., Devakī-nandana. Immediately He begins to grow. But that birth is taking another planet, another universe. Just like six-thirty, sunshine, it is now visible on this planet, or on this city; but again six-thirty, again, in another city, six-thirty in another city, six-thirty another city. It is not very difficult to understand. That six-thirty's continued. That seven-thirty's continued. That eight-thirty's continued. Every minute and second is continued. Simply you have to know where it is. You immediately try to know by phoning the other city, other, on the other country, you'll know that this six-thirty or seven-thirty or twelve-thirty or the set-up or rising of the sun is continually going on, here or there.

Similarly, Kṛṣṇa's appearance, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, everything is continually going on: sometimes in this universe, sometimes in another universe, sometimes another universe. In this way it is going on. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's //līlā// is called //nitya-līlā. Nitya-līlā,// eternal. It is not that for the time being Kṛṣṇa appeared. That //nitya-līlā,// as we have seen within this planet, Kṛṣṇa, that will come again. Just like we saw the sun in the daytime. Now it is not visible, but in due course of time, again we shall see; next morning we shall see sun. Similarly, we shall see again Kṛṣṇa, and that rotation takes place according to Vedic calculation after forty-three //crores// of years. That is the explanation we get from Vedic //śāstra.//

So Kṛṣṇa's //līlā,// it is not an invented, we are worshiping Kṛṣṇa as something imaginary, some artistic picture. No. It is //nitya-līlā.// Kṛṣṇa is fact. //Govindam ādi-puruṣam.// He's //ādi. Advaitam acyutam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam. Purāṇa-puruṣam:// the oldest man. //Purāṇa// means oldest. Oldest, //purāṇa-puruṣam. Puruṣam// means person. //Nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// But whenever you'll see Kṛṣṇa, He's just a perfect young boy, //nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// You'll never see Kṛṣṇa's picture as He has become old, He has grown some big, big beard and... No. Kṛṣṇa, you'll never see. Kṛṣṇa is just like a twenty-years-old young boy. //Nava-yauvanaṁ ca. Vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau// [Bs. 5.33]. He is not to be found in the //Vedas.// There is, but we miss. In the //Ṛg Veda,// in the //Atharva Veda,// Kṛṣṇa is there. //Vedeṣu durla...//

But the ordinary man cannot find. Just like the people, they're reading //Bhagavad-gītā,// but they do not understand Kṛṣṇa. There are so many people, they are very proud of reading //Bhagavad-gītā// daily, but they do not understand Kṛṣṇa. The only thing is, they're missing Kṛṣṇa. Except Kṛṣṇa, all rubbish thing they are talking. This is their vision. Because //vedeṣu durlabha.// For the rubbish person, rascal person, Kṛṣṇa is //durlabha. Adurlabha ātma-bhaktau.// But Kṛṣṇa is available. Kṛṣṇa has to be seen from the Kṛṣṇa's devotee, not from others. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said to Arjuna that "I am again explaining to you this //Bhagavad-gītā// because //bhakto 'si priyo 'si rahasyaṁ hy etad uttamam// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]. There is a very nice mystery in this //Bhagavad-gītā,// and that will be understood by you because you are My devotee. You are My very dear." So in order to understand Kṛṣṇa, one has to first of all become a great devotee, dear friend of Kṛṣṇa. Then he can understand. Otherwise, //vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau// [Bs. 5.33].

So this //Brahma-saṁhitā// describes about Kṛṣṇa. Brahmā is //mahājana.// I've already told you: //mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. So in the //śāstras,// twelve //mahājanas// are accepted:

> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ
> prahlādo janako bhīṣmo
> balir vaiyāsakir vayam
> [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]

This was explained by Yamarāja to his servants, that these are //mahājanas.// Who? //Svayambhūr,// Brahmā. //Svayambhūr nāradaḥ.// And //śambhuḥ,// Lord Śiva. //Svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ kumāraḥ.// The Kumāras, the four Kumāras; Kapila, Kapiladeva, Lord Kapila. Manu, Svāyambhuva Manu. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also, accepted this: //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam, vivasvān manave prāhur// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. This Manu. So in this way, we have to approach the right person, //evaṁ paramparā-prāptam// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]], who is coming in the line of Brahmā, who is coming in the line of Lord Śiva, in the line of Nārada.

In this way, we have to accept a //guru// from the disciplic succession, which is called //paramparā, guru-paramparā.// Then we can understand what is Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise not. Now so many people are explaining //Bhagavad-gītā.// If you ask him, "Who is your //guru?//" he has no //guru.// He's himself //guru.// So you..., what he can understand, //Bhagavad-gītā?// It is not possible. So try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// from the bona fide person and follow the principles, rules and regulation, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Your life will be successful.

Thank you very much.

[break] ...for persons who are too much bodily concept. One who is thinking that "I am this body," for him, this //yoga// system is prescribed, so that he can control the senses. //Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ.// By controlling the senses... Because we are disturbed by our senses. So there is process, how to come to the platform of //prāṇāyāma.// You have to find out a secluded place, and you should sit down there alone in perpendicular stature; you cannot close your eyes fully---half---then you'll have to see the tip of the nose. In this way, you have to concentrate your mind on Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa. This is //prāṇāyāma.// So... But actually when one becomes already attracted to Kṛṣṇa by devotional service, then the //prāṇāyāma// process is already there. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gata antarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

The real fact is to concentrate your mind upon Kṛṣṇa.

So these boys, they have been trained up. This //ārotik,// this //arcana,// this distribution of literature, reading Kṛṣṇa books, hearing about Kṛṣṇa---that means they are not allowed to think anything else except Kṛṣṇa. That is perfect. They are... The //prāṇāyāma// process, you can do it for one hour, two hour or, say, one day, two days, but this, this //prāṇāyāma// process, who are always engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, that is natural. You cannot think. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. If you simply engage your mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, that is perpetual //prāṇāyāma.// Not for one hour, two hour or a minute.

**Indian reporter:**
But as some //yogīs// say that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Some //yogī// may say whatever he likes, but what Kṛṣṇa says, we have to accept.

**Indian reporter:**
In the modern..., in the modern terminology, they say this, this technique of //prāṇāyāma...//

**Prabhupāda:**
But the modern terminology, that is not..., that is not a principle.

**Indian reporter:**
No, but they say it is a rocket way to God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Indian reporter:**
They say it is a rocket way to God, doing //prāṇāyāma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] What is it?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
A rocket, rocket ship way to God.

**Indian reporter:**
Rocket.

**Prabhupāda:**
But we don't find so long //yogīs// and //prāṇāyāma-wallas// know anything about God. We have tested so many. They remain the same rascal. I have seen it. They do not... Ask him, any //yogīs,// "What do you know about God?" Ask him. You can ask. You are press reporter. You can ask, "What do you know about God? Describe Him." So what is the rocket? Rocket means you should do immediately. But if you do not know, then what is the use of this rocket? If you do not know what is God, then what is the use of this rocket? Just like they are going to the rocket planet, moon planet.

Now the American government stopped announcing this rascaldom. You know that? Yes. So if you actually have got rocket, then you must approach that you must know the thing. But simply waste your money and come back... So any sensible man will not allow this. This is good, //prāṇāyāma.// Rocket process, it may be. But we don't think that it is rocket process at the present age. Because in the //śāstras// it is said:

> kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ
> tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ
> dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ
> kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt
> [SB 12.3.52]

**Indian reporter:**
No, they compare it to rocket only because of the two stages that a rocket has to drop. They say by doing //prāṇāyāma// you'll drop material stages, that you...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right, but we have to see practically what he has become. Simply talking will not do.

**Indian reporter:**
Talking. Talking won't do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Simply talking will not do. That, that... Just, these boys, they did not practice //prāṇāyāma// system, but bring anyone who knows about God better than him. Bring anyone. Any //yogīs,// bring, and talk with them. They are neophytes. They are simply practicing three or four years. And talk with them. And what he knows about, he knows it will be proved. That is not rocket system. This is rocket system: Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// [laughter] That is not possible.

That he cannot find out a secluded place to practice //yoga.// Where is secluded place in the city? Whole day and night, these cars are going and there is huge sound. Where is secluded place? And, and it is recommended in //Bhagavad-gītā,// secluded place and sacred place. And he should remain alone. Where is such //yogī?// Find out. Where is such //yogī?// He should remain alone, and in a secluded place and a sacred place. And he should not change his //āsana.// Then he becomes a //yogī.// These are the preliminary things. But who is practicing these preliminary even? They cannot. Especially in the cities, there are so many //yoga// societies, but in the..., it is stated that it should be practiced in a secluded place. So how it is possible in the city? So if you follow the instruction, it will be very difficult. It is very difficult.

**Indian reporter:**
For a city-dweller.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Not only difficult for us, but five thousand years ago, Arjuna was talking with Kṛṣṇa face to face. Such a exalted personality, and he was a //kṣatriya.// He said, "Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible to practice this." He said. We have become more than Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna? Do you think? He said. You'll find in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Eh?

**Devotee:**
//Cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa...//

**Prabhupāda:**

> ...kṛṣṇa
> pramāthi balavad dṛḍham
> tasyāhaṁ nigrahaṁ manye
> vāyor iva su-duṣkaram
> [[books:bg:6:34|[Bg. 6.34]]]

"Oh, it is not possible." He was frank enough gentleman. "Oh, this is not possible. This is not possible." And these foolish persons, because they want to cheat others, they cheat themselves, they cheat others, they follow this system. It is not possible. It is not possible, frankly speaking. Do we think we are better than Arjuna?

**Devotee:**
In //Bhagavad-gītā,// Arjuna's called Guḍākeśa, or one who has conquered sleep.

**Prabhupāda:**
So this //yoga// process is there, but it is very, very difficult. Very, very difficult, especially in this age. Therefore in the //śāstra// it is said, //kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇu// [SB 12.3.52]. The //dhyāyato viṣṇu,// that is //yoga// system. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. //Yoginaḥ,// being absorbed in meditation, they see. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā.// Mind, being absorbed in the Supreme, they can see. //Yaṁ paśyanti yoginaḥ.// The //yogī// sees. That is //samādhi.// That is... //Prāṇāyāma,// of course, they controlling the breathing. So these things are very difficult in this age. Therefore //śāstra// says,

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalaṁ
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

Three times. When we stress upon some important point, we say three times, "Do it, do it, do it!" It is like that. //Kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.// So //yoga// practice is approved process, but it requires long, long period time, and the time is not at all suitable in this age. And persons are differently cultured. They are eating everything, they are drinking everything, smoking. And it is not possible. It is not possible. Simply childish. It is not possible. And you can see practically. Just like I have given the example. Bring any so-called //yogī,// mystic practitioner...

**Indian reporter:**
As you, yourself, have said: What is talking? What is lies?

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the use of that persons? Here, the mass of people take. All over the world. Suppose if there is some process, if..., and one percent of the whole population, what is the use of such process? So that is very important thing. That is important process also, but it is not possible to be practiced by the present age. This is... [break] ...become purified, you understand that Kṛṣṇa is present on your tongue. [break] ...waterpot, you put it in the water. So long it is not filled up, it will make some sound. And when it is filled up and goes down, down to hell, then there is no //cut-cut-cut.//

**Indian reporter:**
Then, as you say...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? [break] ... that your, this so-called talk will not help you. But that does not mean that in the spiritual life there is no talk. But Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is spirit. So why He's talking //Bhagavad-gītā?// What is... What do you think of Kṛṣṇa's talking? [break] //...nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇa. Nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇa..., rasa-vigraha, caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ.//

> nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś
> caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ
> pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto
> 'bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:133|[Cc. Madhya 17.133]]]

This is //nāma. Abhinnatvād nāma-nāminoḥ.// There is no difference between the name and the person. Here, in this material world, there is difference between the name and the thing. Just like if I want water, if I simply chant "water, water, water..." Sometimes some rascals, these, give the example that if we chant "Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola..." [laughter] It is not like that. They do not know, and they, they, they dare to explain this //nāma.// Such a rascal they are. They do not know what is name. Here is a description of the name: //nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś caitanya-rasa-vi...// This is //caitanya.// This is not dead stone. This body is dead stone. //Caitanya// means the living force. That is //caitanya.// So //nāma// is //caitanya.//

> nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś
> caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ
> pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto
> 'bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:133|[Cc. Madhya 17.133]]]

This name is not ordinary name. This is absolute.

**Indian reporter:**
How is that they say that in some of the //mantras// they are //śata cakras// and all that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmmh?

**Indian reporter:**
Some of the //mantras...//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. We have nothing to do with //cakra.// These //cakras// are concerned who are in the bodily concept of life. The //bhaktas,// they do not accept that "I am body." The //śata cakra// is concerned with this body, not with the soul. Yes. So these, the //yoga// process is prescribed for them who are too much in con..., bodily concept of life. Otherwise, those who are spiritually advanced, they're..., they do not have to practice this //yoga.// This, simply name, if we follow... Actually, practically, you see. You practically see that all over the world, these boys, how they're advancing simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//

So this is fact. It is not imagination. How they're advancing, how they're becoming... Now, //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam,// to make zero [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. They've made everything zero. They don't consider that they're Americans. Yes. They don't consider that "I am this body. I have to eat flesh, meat and wine; therefore my body will be maintained." They never think like that. This is //mukti.// Simply talking will not do. Practically. "I practice //yoga,// and immediately my throat has become dried. Please give me cigarette. Please give me." There are so many. I have seen.

**Indian reporter:**
So they are not //yogīs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
You will find, if you analyze, you'll find so many. They're, at least, they smoke //gañjā.// There are so many //yogīs,// I have seen, they smoke //gañjā.// You have not seen? //Gañjā//-smoker //yogīs?//

**Indian reporter:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Indian man (2):**
Number of them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Number of them. I do not know how you have studied. So many rascals, smoking //gañjā// and talking of //yoga.//

**Devotee:**
Drinking tea.

**Prabhupāda:**
Taking tea, that is common affair. Big, big jug, tea.

**Indian man:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
So see practically. Simply talking will not help. Practically see how this system is perfect. Thousands and thousands; not only one, two. If you travel all over the world and see our temples, you'll find in each and every temple, two hundred, hundred and fifty, fifty---all devotees. All these boys and girls, nice. They, their countrymen, astonished. They ask them, "Are you American?" They ask them. How this transformation has come into existence?

> nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś
> caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ
> pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto
> 'bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:133|[Cc. Madhya 17.133]]]

It is nondifferent from Kṛṣṇa. So by chanting "Kṛṣṇa" means they are associating Kṛṣṇa directly. There is no question of //śata cakra// or this //cakra.// No. It is direct contact with Kṛṣṇa. And if one is in direct contact with Kṛṣṇa, what other method does he require? Everything is... //Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tathā kim.// If you are in direct touch with Kṛṣṇa, then where is the necessity of other //tapasya?// Everything is finished.

Your ultimate goal is obtained. And //nārādhito yadi haris tapasā tathā kim:// and if you could not touch Kṛṣṇa, then where is this nonsense, //yoga// and //jñāna?// They're useless. You could not touch Kṛṣṇa. These things are... //Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tathā kim, nārādhito yadi haris tapasā tathā kim// [Nārada Pañcarātra].

**Indian reporter:**
And that is why He's called Yogeśvara.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. If you are in touch with the Yogeśvara, then your all austerities, penances, finished. Now you enjoy life with Yogeśvara. That is the position of the devotees. //Ānandamaya...//

> ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis
> tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ

This is a great science. So we have described all this in our books. They are reading, and public is very much appreciating.

All right. [end]
