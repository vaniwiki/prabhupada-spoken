**Pradyumna:**
[reading] "...propensity expands just as a vibration of light or air expands, but we do not know where it ends. //The Nectar of Devotion// teaches us the science of loving every one of the living entities perfectly by the easy method of loving Kṛṣṇa. We have failed to create peace and harmony in human society even by such great attempts as the United Nations because we do not know the right method."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. The example is just like there is air vibration, water vibration, the radio message. In one place the vibration is made, and it goes like waves. It expands. Very quickly, within a second, it expands seven times the earth, so far we have heard. Or if you throw one stone on the lake, they'll become a circle, circle, and the circle expands, unless it goes to the limit. So our loving propensity is there, and it should expand. Ultimately, it should reach the lotus feet of the Lord. Then it will be perfect. So this is being explained.

So //nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti.// In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said, //nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti.// Our love for Kṛṣṇa is there already, but it is being choked up by material condition. I want to love, but some blind leader, he comes, he says that "You love your this country, your society, humanity." And you love your society, but you cut throat of another society. This is going on.

Because it is imperfect, one side they're teaching, "Love your nation," and cut the throat of another nation. So this kind of love, or this kind of loving propensity will not be ever satisfied. We shall always remain unsatisfied, because this is artificial. The same example: If you want to love, then you have to pour water on the root of the tree. Then it will be all right. Otherwise, if you manufacture so many ways of love, then certainly you'll be confused and frustrated.

[aside:] Why don't you sit down here? Come on. Yes.

[aside:] Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"The method is very simple, but one has to understand it with a cool head. //The Nectar of Devotion// teaches all men how to perform the simple and natural method of loving Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we learn how to love Kṛṣṇa, then it is very easy to immediately and simultaneously..."

**Prabhupāda:**
In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said,

> kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya
> śraddhā-śabde-viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]]

To be elevated to the transcendental platform of loving service of the Supreme Lord, there is a process. The process is that, as it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// This is the process. You have to increase your attachment for Kṛṣṇa. This //yoga// system you have to adopt, how to increase your love for Kṛṣṇa. That is not very difficult. Just like this //arcana, śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. So these are the different processes how to increase your attachment for Kṛṣṇa. The attachment of Kṛṣṇa is there, but by //śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya.//

> nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti sādhya kabhu naya
> śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:107|[Cc. Madhya 22.107]]]

Everyone has got love for Kṛṣṇa. It is not artificial thing. Everyone has got. Otherwise how these Europeans and American boys and girls taking to this principle? Why they are mad after Kṛṣṇa? Because it was there. It is not... Artificially, you cannot make such thing. It is not possible. Artificially you cannot make a staunch devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Artificially, one day, two days, three days---then goes away. Just like it has become in our country. Our love is now for material happiness. Poverty for the last two thousand years or one..., little above, one thousand years, India was foreign-subjugated. So they are now thinking that "Some way or other, if we can become like Americans, skyscraper buildings, our life will be successful."

So they have... Artificially, now. They're killing their own culture and trying to imitate. This is artificial. But this artificial way, one cannot be happy. They'll be frustrated. Just the Americans have become frustrated. They have got enough. What is the skyscraper buildings in Bombay? They have got hundred times skyscraper buildings in New York. Hundred times. And what is this skyscraper? Say, twenty stories? There are hundred and four, -five stories. When I first went to New York I saw one building, Empire, Empire State?

**Devotees:**
State.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It was hundred and two stories. Now the others, they have increased to hundred and four, -five. So... But why these American boys are frustrated? Their father, their grandfather have got enough money, enough skyscraper building, but they are not satisfied. They don't want to work like their father and grandfather. They've left. I have got many students, my disciples, their father, very rich man, industrialist, lawyers. But they don't like.

So this kind, this kind of so-called happiness will never satisfy us. The real happiness which is within---our love, loving propensity for Kṛṣṇa---that has to be revived. //Nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti sādhya kabhu naya.// It is not by artificial means one becomes a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Nobody can become a lover or devotee of anyone else by artificial means unless there is some natural tendency. So that natural tendency for..., to love Kṛṣṇa is there in everyone's heart. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is how to invoke that natural tendency to love Kṛṣṇa. That is our business. And how it is possible? The //śāstra,// the //Śrīmad...,// //śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya. Śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte. Śravaṇādi// means this process. Just like you have come here; you are hearing about Kṛṣṇa. This is the process. You may be illiterate, you may be rich or you may be poor. Whatever you may be, it doesn't matter. Please come, sit down and hear.

But in the hearing process there is so many impediments, //māyā.// Just like people are coming here to hear, but there has been impediment: "Oh, sir, our lift if being too much used. The electric supply will cut off." //Māyā// is always there. They will, I mean to say, spend electric energy in so many ways---that is not loss. But people were coming for half an hour and one hour, gentlemen, "No. Electricity will be spoiled." This is //māyā. Māyā// is always after this checking process. So we have to fight against the //māyā,// then we come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That fighting determination must be there. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. One must be determined. So //māyā// may check my progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but I must fight //māyā.// This determination wanted. //Dṛḍha-vratāḥ. Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ.// That is wanted. "All right, let me do. All right, not. That's all right. Let me do my business." No, no. One must be very serious, //dṛḍha-vratāḥ. Dṛḍha-vratāḥ,// and firmly convinced. These things are required to revive your Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise it is very easy.

//Śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when there was discussion about //śraddhā// and //sādhana//---what is the aim of life and what is the process of achieving that aim of life---this discussion was made between Rāmānanda Rāya and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was questioning, and Rāmānanda Rāya was replying. So the first reply was given by Rāmānanda Rāya when Caitanya Mahāprabhu inquired, "What is the goal of life?" and "What is the process to reach that goal of life?" Very nice question. So Rāmānanda Rāya replied,

> varṇāśramācāravatā
> puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān
> viṣṇur ārādhyate puṁsāṁ
> nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]

He immediately replied that a human being must, first of all, come to the standard of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// Four //varṇas// and four //āśramas: brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// and //brahmacārī, gṛhastha...// Unless they come systematically, life on these principles, they're animals. They're not human being. They're... That was our Indian, Vedic civilization. Now they have manufactured their religion: //yata mat tata path.// You can manufacture your own way and you be satisfied. This is being done. So many. You can see in Bombay, so many rascals are preaching. They..., there is no standard thing. So it is very difficult for us to give us the right thing, but we are certain. Because we are not cheating people, so it may take some time, but people are gradually coming to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, because this is right thing.

So //varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. This is the beginning of actual human life. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately replied, //ihā bāhya āge kaha āra. Ihā bāhya. Bāhya// means this is external. This will not very much help at the present moment. And actually that is being done. Just like we are preaching in the Western countries. If we wanted to establish //varṇāśrama-dharma// in the beginning, that "You become //brāhmaṇa,// you become //gṛhastha,// you become //sannyāsī...//" No. Then everyone would have rejected: "Sir, we are not prepared for this purpose." But the process introduced by Caitanya Mahāprabhu...

It is not introduced by Caitanya Mahāprabhu; it is the sanction in the //śāstras: śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. This is standard method. Because we gave them the chance of hearing, gradually they're coming. Not that immediately you become //brāhmaṇa.// Now they are becoming more than //brāhmaṇas.// Here, in India, the //brāhmaṇas,// they are doing everything. Still they are going in the name of //brāhmaṇa.// But here, these European //brāhmaṇas,// American //brāhmaṇas,// they're real //brāhmaṇas,// because they have given up all sinful activities. The //brāhmaṇa's// life is first of all truthful. Truthful. //Satya śama dama titikṣa.// Controlling the senses, controlling the mind, forbearance and simplicity, full knowledge, application of knowledge, belief in the //Vedas//---these are the symptoms of //brāhmaṇa. Satya śama dama titikṣa ārjavam āstikyaṁ jñānaṁ vijñānaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]].

So if we take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, these brahminical qualification automatically come. //Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. This is the test. A devotee shall be qualified with all the godly qualities. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu said if you induce people... Because His mission is to propagate this Vedic culture all over the world. He's not confined within some limited area. //Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]. As many villages and towns are there in the world, His mission is to be preached there. So, so if we, in the beginning we say, "You have to become a //brāhmaṇa// first of all," so who's going to become a //brāhmaṇa?// Our people are not becoming //brāhmaṇa.// They'll say, "It is all nonsense. Let us become //śūdra.//" So that is not possible. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //ihā bāhya āge kaha āra. Bāhya.//

Then Rāmānanda Rāya suggested //karma-miśra-bhakti,// then //jñāna-miśra-bhakti---bhakti// with //jñāna,// mixed with //jñāna,// process of //jñāna,// speculative philosophy; and //bhakti// mixed with //karma, karma-kāṇḍīya, karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra.// But real //bhakti// is //jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. It must be untouched by the process of //jñāna// and //karma.// It should be spontaneous. Spontaneous. That is //bhakti. Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam, ānukūlyena kṛṣṇa// [Brs. 1.1.11]. Spontaneous means when we shall rise to the platform that "Here is a service for Kṛṣṇa. Let me do it immediately. Let me do it." Just like Yudhiṣṭhira was advised by Kṛṣṇa that "You just go to Dronācārya and speak him lie that his son is dead." Yudhiṣṭhira hesitated: "Oh, how can I speak lie? I never done it in my life." This is //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra.// This is //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra.// He is..., he is looking after his own benefit.

//Karma-kāṇḍa vicāra// means I do something and I profit and I enjoy it. I do some sacrifices, I become elevated to the heavenly planet, and I enjoy life. This is //karma-kāṇḍa.// And //jñāna-kāṇḍa// means that this world is false: //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā;// therefore let me merge into the Brahman effulgence. //Nirbheda brahmānusandhana.// This is //jñāna-kāṇḍa. Nirbheda brahmānusandhana.// But //bhakti// means //jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. One must be free from this //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa vicāra.// Must be pure devotee. What is that? //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanam.// Simply to carry out.

So it was the duty of Yudhiṣṭhira to immediately, what Kṛṣṇa said, immediately to execute it. But because he was on the //karma-kāṇḍīya...// Of course, they were all devotees, but just to show us... The //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra,// they hesitated. Just like the //brāhmaṇas// who were..., yajñic //brāhmaṇa// who was performing sacrifices, and Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's friends became hungry. So they asked Kṛṣṇa, "Kṛṣṇa we are hungry. Give me... Please arrange for some food." Kṛṣṇa said, "Yes, you go immediately there. The //brāhmaṇas// are performing //yajñas,// and ask them for some food."

They went, but the //brāhmaṇas// refused: "Oh, the //yajña// is not yet performed. How we can give you? No, no. Don't talk." So they came back. Then Kṛṣṇa said, "Go to their wives, the yajñic //brāhmaṇa patnī.// Go to their wives." And as soon as they went to the wives, they heard Kṛṣṇa's name, they were very much beloved to Kṛṣṇa. Immediately, whatever was there for the //yajña,// immediately they brought to Kṛṣṇa. This is //bhakti.// And the yajñic //brāhmaṇas// were in the //karma-kāṇḍīya// platform, but they were devotees. But when actually it was performed... What is that verse? //Dik janma...?//

**Indian man:**
//Dik janma tri veda vidvān. Dik janma aha. Tri vid vidvān// means //Vedas...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes, yes.

**Indian man:**
What all these //Vedas...?// Because useless. //Dig janma...,// got worldly, great family, is also useless. //Tri vid vidvān..., bahut jñānam...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bahut jñānam.//

**Indian man:**
//...dik kulam// [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Brāhmaṇa,// born in //brāhmaṇa// family. Yes.

**Indian man:**
//...dik kriyā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So this is //bhakti.// And //bhakti// means spontaneously responding to Kṛṣṇa. That is //bhakti.// There is no... Therefore it is transcendental platform. It is not on this material. Material platform, //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa.// But //bhakti// is above.

> māṁ ca avyabhicāriṇi
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

Transcendental platform.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that this //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra,// that is also nice, those who are in the too much bodily concept of life. But it is very difficult to raise the people to the //karma-kāṇḍīya, jñāna-kāṇḍīya vicāra.// In this age especially, they have become so fallen that it is not possible for them to raise them, either //karma-kāṇḍīya, jñāna-kāṇḍīya// or yogic process. This is not possible. Therefore in the //śāstra// it is said, //kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.// If you follow //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra, jñāna-kāṇḍīya vicāra// or yogic process, it is very difficult. Therefore the only process is,

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma iva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

And Narottama, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa, sakali visera bandha amrta baliya yeba khaya.//

So suppose //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra,// you, you get elevated to the heavenly planet---that's all right---by //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra.// But what Kṛṣṇa says about this elevation? //Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. These results derived out of //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa,// they are temporary. Of course, we do..., we do not know what kind of temporary. But temporary means even if you live for many millions of years, that is also temporary, because you are eternal.

So somebody's living for one year, somebody's living for one minute, and somebody's living for one millions or more than that. Just like Brahma's life: //sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ// [[books:bg:8:17|[Bg. 8.17]]]. That is also temporary. Our problem is to get our eternal life again. //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāmaṁ pa...// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. This is the process. One should go to such a place that he'll not have to come back again to this temporary world. So //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa// means you can be elevated to the heavenly planet by //karma-kāṇḍīya// process, or even to the Brahmā planet, Brahmaloka, Satyaloka. But what Kṛṣṇa says? //Ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]].

So that will not give us the ultimate benefit. The ultimate benefit is,

> mām upetya kaunteya
> duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam
> nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ
> saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gataḥ
> [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]

That is wanted. One has to go back to home, back to Godhead. That is the perfection of life. This human life should be utilized for going back to home, back to... But they have no idea. They do not know what is God, where is back to home, back to Godhead---nothing, no education, although the knowledge is there in the //Bhagavad-gītā// and other //śāstras.// Everything is there, but we have become so fool that we take //Bhagavad-gītā// and comment in a different way so that people may not understand. He does not understand himself, and how he'll explain? //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. Because without becoming a devotee, nobody can understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// That's a fact.

So they..., one may be very good scholar, A-B-C-D, but the A-B-C-D knowledge is not sufficient to understand. //Bhakto 'si priyo 'si me rahasyaṁ hy etad uttamam// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]. Simply by erudite scholarship you cannot understand. Then Kṛṣṇa would have selected somebody else who is scholarly advanced. But He was selecting Arjuna, although he was a soldier. He was not a Vedāntist, he was not a //brāhmaṇa,// but he was ordinary soldier. Maybe royal family. //Gṛhastha.// But He selected him. Why? //Bhakto 'si:// because he was devotee. Therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// is to be understood by devotee from the very beginning.

So one has to become devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Then we can understand the teachings of the //Vedas. Vedas// means //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. Any way you go, either you... //Bhagavad-gītā// is also Vedic literature. //Bhāgavata// is also Vedic literature. So either you take directly //Vedas, Īśopaniṣad,// other //Upaniṣad,// the ultimate goal is to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam.// So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to give Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇa se tomāra, kṛṣṇa dite pāra.// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung that //vaiṣṇava ṭhākura, tomāra kukura baliyā jānaha more.// He's presenting himself, "My dear sir, Vaiṣṇava, kindly accept me as your dog." //Davita...// What is that song? You have forgotten?

**Śyāmasundara:**
I don't know.

**Indian man:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Vai...//

**Indian man:**
//Kṛṣṇa se tomāra...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. //Kṛṣṇa se tomāra, kṛṣṇa dite pāra, tomāra śakati āche// [Śaraṇāgati]. This is a fact. If you want Kṛṣṇa, then you have to approach a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He can give you, deliver you. //Vedeṣu durlabha adurlabha ātma-bhaktau.// If one is Kṛṣṇa devotee, he can deliver Kṛṣṇa: "Take Him. Here is Kṛṣṇa." That is the special prerogative of devotee. //Kaunteya pratijānīhi.// Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa is advising Arjuna, because he's devotee, that "You declare, //na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati.//" So He could declare Himself. No. He wants to declare everything through His devotee. //Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savya-sācin// [[books:bg:11:33|[Bg. 11.33]]]. He want to see that Arjuna becomes victorious, although He was conducting; actually He was doing this victory also, war.

So in this way, //kṛṣṇa-bhakti..., nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// if we simply invoke our //kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// that is success of life. Some way or other. Therefore Rūpa Gosvāmī says that //yena tena prakāreṇa manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet.// Somehow or other, just be absorbed within your mind about Kṛṣṇa. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. Some way or other. It doesn't matter which way. And another place Rūpa Gosvāmī says, //kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate.// "Purchase this //kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ,// Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if it is available somewhere." //Tatra laulyam eka mūlyam, na janma koṭibhiḥ sukṛtibhiḥ labhyate.//

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very rare thing, but, by the grace of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, it is being distributed all over the world freely. It is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's grace. //Mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. If we adopt the method of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then we can distribute what Kṛṣṇa..., //kṛṣṇa-prema,// love of Kṛṣṇa. Knowledge of Kṛṣṇa may be distributed. The scholars and the //paṇḍitas,// they can understand, but love of Kṛṣṇa is different thing. That is a different thing. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is distributing love of Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te.//

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]

So if we follow through the path chalked out by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then Kṛṣṇa also, although He..., it is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa... //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahareṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye, yatatām api siddhānām// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. But through the process of Caitanya Mahāprabhu... And to follow Caitanya Mahāprabhu means to follow the six Gosvāmīs, because these six Gosvāmīs were directly instructed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu to spread this movement. He instructed Rūpa Gosvāmī continually for ten days in Prayāga, Daśāśvamedha-ghāṭa. He instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī for two months in Benares. And they have given us this invaluable literature. There are so many other literatures, of which the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// we have translated into English: //Nectar of Devotion.// So try to follow this book.

//Rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti...// Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is singing,

> rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhaba śrī yugala-pīriti
> [Gaurāṅga Bolite Habe]

The //sahajiyās,// they immediately try to understand the love affairs of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī. That is //sahajiyā//-ism. Here we have to take instruction from Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. First of all we have to take the mercy of Rūpa-Raghunātha, Gosvāmī. Then if there is..., our luck is good, then we can understand what is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //prema.// You..., it is not a thing to be understood by the common man in the bazaar, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, in spite of hearing Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //līlā// for many, many years, they remain in the same position, not a single step forward, what to..., to understand Kṛṣṇa.

Because they do not try to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa through the channel chalked out by Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Gosvāmīs. We must know. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa is not ordinary. //Rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śakti.// This is the manifestation of the //ahlādinī śakti// of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa does not enjoy any material thing. The //gopīs// and Rādhārāṇī, they are not these ordinary girls. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ// [Bs. 5.37].

So this is the process. We don't, therefore, advise people that immediately come to understand //rāsa-līlā.// No. We never do so. First of all, understand Kṛṣṇa by the channel, by the proper method. Then gradually, when you are actually purified, they you'll understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

> rūpa-raghunātha-padehaibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhaba śrī-yugala-pīriti
> [Gaurāṅga Bolite Habe]

They don't become //sahajiyā,// to understand Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa just like ordinary... They're understanding Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and they're inclined to so many nonsense things. If one understands Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, his impulse for sex life, //vīta rāga kāma,// immediately will be finished. He'll never think of... As Yamunā, Yamunācārya says, //yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor.// You know the verse?

**Indian man:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cite it. //Yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor.// Yamunācārya.

**Indian man:**
Oh, ahh... [recites another Sanskrit verse]

**Prabhupāda:**
No. This verse:

> yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor
> nava-nava-[rasa-]dhāmany [udyataṁ] rantum āsīt
> tad-avadhi mama bata nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne
> bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca
> [Yāmunācārya]

So this is the test. If actually one understands Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //līlā,// then they'll forget forever this sex life of the material world. This is the test. So our request is that don't try to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Just worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa according to the //arcana-vidhi.// Then gradually Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa will be pleased, Caitanya Mahāprabhu will be pleased, and //svayam eva sphuraty adhaḥ. Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau// [Brs. 1.2.234]. When They are pleased by your //sevā,// then They will reveal. Don't try to jump over to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. That will not help us.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
