**Mādhavānanda:**
[reading] "...Four. Devotional Service Surpasses All Liberation. How much a devotee is seriously attached to the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood from the statement of Mahārāja Pṛthu [//Ādi-rāja//], which is described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Fourth Canto, Twentieth Chapter, twenty-first verse [[books:sb:4:20:21|[SB 4.20.21]]] . He prays to the Supreme Personality of Godhead thusly: 'My dear Lord, if after taking liberation I have no chance of hearing the glories of Your Lordship, glories chanted by pure devotees from the core of their hearts in praise of Your lotus feet, and if I have no chance for this honey of transcendental bliss, then I shall never ask for liberation of this so-called spiritual emancipation. I shall simply always pray unto Your Lordship that You may give me millions of tongues and millions of ears so that I can constantly chant and hear of Your transcendental glories.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Surpasses all kind of liberation. There are five kinds of liberation: //sāyujya, sārūpya, sālokya, sāmīpya...// But a pure devotee does not want any of such liberations. //Dhiyamānāṁ na ghṛnanti//[?]. Even liberation is offered... Kṛṣṇa offers liberation very easily. But Kṛṣṇa's personal touch is so sublime that Kṛṣṇa is carrying order of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira is sending letter, handed over to Kṛṣṇa, and He's carrying to Duryodhana. So Nārada was very much surprised, that this stage of dependent on devotee is very, very difficult to achieve. To achieve liberation is not very difficult, but when Kṛṣṇa becomes dependent on the order of a devotee, that is very difficult to achieve.

So therefore pure devotional service surpasses all kinds of liberation. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also teaches, //mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi.// Liberation means no more birth. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //mama janmani janmani//---birth after birth. But the..., a devotee does not want anything of the material things. //Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]].

So this pure devotional service is a different subject matter. //Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. Therefore Vyāsadeva says that all kinds of motivated religious system is rejected from devotional service. //Projjhita-kaitavaḥ. Kaitava// means motivated. In devotional service there is no motive---simply to serve Kṛṣṇa. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. That is pure devotion.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"The impersonalists desire to merge into the existence of the Supreme, but without keeping their individuality, they have no chance of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord. Because they have no idea of the transcendental form of the Supreme Lord, there is no chance of their chanting and hearing of His transcendental activities."

**Prabhupāda:**
The impersonalists take it, this chanting, as means to attain liberation. They do not know that the chanting is the..., real chanting begins after liberation. Not that by chanting one reaches liberation. No. That's not the fact. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. //Satatam. Satatam// means after liberation also. This chanting will continue after liberation also. Not that after liberation, chanting will finish. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said //satatam. Satatam// means after liberation also. Before liberation and after liberation. Therefore it is //nitya. Nitya// means it does not stop; never stops. //Satataṁ kīrtayananto māṁ yatantaś ca, tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca. Dṛḍha-vratāḥ.// So the..., when you actually go to Goloka Vṛndāvana, the same chanting will go on before Kṛṣṇa. Chanting will never stop.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"In other words, unless one is already beyond liberation, one cannot relish the transcendental glories of the Lord, nor can one understand the transcendental form of the Lord.

"A similar statement is found in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Fifth Canto, Fourteenth Chapter, forty-third verse [[books:sb:5:14:43|[SB 5.14.43]]]. Śukadeva Gosvāmī addresses Parīkṣit Mahārāja there and says, 'The great soul of King Bharata was so much attached to the service of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa that he very easily gave up his lordship over the earthly planet and his affection for his children, society, friends, royal opulence and beautiful wife. He was so very lucky that the goddess of fortune was pleased to offer him all kinds of material concessions, but he never accepted any of these material opulences.'

"Śukadeva Gosvāmī eulogizes this behavior of King Bharata very highly. He says, 'Any person whose heart is attracted by the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Madhusūdana, not to speak of material opulences, does not care even for that liberation which is aspired to by many great sages.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
This Mahārāja Bharata was the son of Ṛṣabhadeva and under whose name..., after whose name this planet is called Bhārata-varsa. This, the same Bharata Mahārāja, he left this world at very young age, twenty-four years. Young wife, children, kingdom, everything he left. Then he developed some attachment for a young deer. So he had to take the birth in the shape of a deer. The next birth he remained silent, Jaḍa Bharata. So Jaḍa Bharata story is there in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Very enlightening.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"In the //Bhāgavatam,// Sixth Canto, Eleventh Chapter, twenty-third verse [[books:sb:6:11:23|[SB 6.11.23]]], there is a similar statement by Vṛtrāsura, who addresses the Lord as follows: 'My dear Lord, by leaving Your transcendental service I...' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// Rūpa Gosvāmī, he's presenting this //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// quoting from so many scriptures. //Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau.// They were very, very expert in studying //śāstra// very scrutinizingly. //Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau// [//Ṣaḍ Gosvāmy Aṣṭaka//]. Why they studied so much? Because they wanted to establish //sad-dharma,// real type of religion, //bhakti.// They are quoting, therefore, from so many, //nānā-śāstra.//

//Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.// That is welfare activity. //Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.// These people are trying to give some service to the //daridra-nārāyaṇa,// but they do not know actually what is //jīve dayā.// This is //jīve daya. Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.// They should know things with reference to the authorized scripture. Not that I manufacture some words according to my whims. That is not service to the hu... That is misleading, disservice. Because, if they are kept in ignorance, what is the value of such service? Here is. He does not manufacture anything. He's giving immediately evidence, reference to the authorized scripture.

That is the way of presenting things. Not that "I think," "In my opinion." What you are? But in, in Vaiṣṇava philosophy, even Caitanya Mahāprabhu, although He was Kṛṣṇa Himself, whenever He spoke something, immediately He gave evidence from the //śāstra.// Even Kṛṣṇa, while He was speaking //Bhagavad-gītā,// He also gave reference to the //Vedānta-sūtra: brahma-sūtra-padaiś caiva hetumadbhir viniścitaiḥ// [[books:bg:13:5|[Bg. 13.5]]]. He was giving reference to the //Brahmā-sūtra.// That is the way of authorized presentation. Kṛṣṇa is Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He was also giving reference. He also said, //yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ// [[books:bg:16:23|[Bg. 16.23]]].

We cannot give up //śāstras.// If we give up //śāstra,// then Kṛṣṇa says, //sa siddhiṁ sāvāpnoti na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim// [[books:bg:16:23|[Bg. 16.23]]]. If we give up //śāstra,// if we manufacture our own words, own //śāstra,// these are all rascaldom. That should not be accepted. So here you see Rūpa Gosvāmī's writing. The //śloka,// number, canto---everything is given. //Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau.//

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
“ 'My dear Lord, by leaving Your transcendental service I may be promoted to the planet called Dhruva-loka [the polestar], or I may gain lordship over all the planetary systems of the universe. But I do not aspire to this. Nor do I wish the mystic perfections of //yoga// practice, nor do I aspire for spiritual emancipation. All I wish for, my Lord, is Your association and transcendental service eternally.'

"This statement is confirmed by Lord Śiva in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Sixth Canto, Seventeenth Chapter, fifty-second verse, wherein Lord Śiva addresses Satī thusly: 'My dear Satī, persons who are devoted to Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa, are not afraid of anything. If they are elevated to the higher planetary systems, or if they get liberation from material contamination, or if they are pushed down to the hellish condition of life---or, in fact, in any situation whatever---they are not afraid of anything. Simply because they have taken shelter of the lotus feet of Nārāyaṇa, for them any position in the material world is as good as another.' "

**Prabhupāda:**

> nārāyaṇa-paraḥ sarve
> na kutaścana bibhyati
> svargā narakeṣv
> api tulyārtha darśinaḥ...
> 
> svargāpavarga-narakeṣv
> api tulyārtha darśinaḥ
> [[books:sb:6:17:28|[SB 6.17.28]]]

Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"There is a similar statement by Indra, the King of heaven, in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Sixth Canto, Eighteenth Chapter, fifty-second verse [[books:sb:6:18:52|[SB 6.18.52]]]. There Indra addresses his mother in this manner: 'My dear Mother [Aditi], persons who have given up all kinds of desires and are simply engaged in devotional service to the Lord know what is actually their self-interest. Such persons are actually serving their self-interests and are considered first-class experts in the matter of advancing to the perfectional stage of life.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
That is... Everyone is after his self-interest, but real self-interest is approach Viṣṇu. //Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti surayaḥ// [//Ṛg Veda// 1.22.20]. And in the //Bhāgavata// it is said, //na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. //Svārtha-gati.// Our real self-interest is in Viṣṇu. They do not know. //Bahir-artha-māninaḥ. Durāśayā. Bahir-artha-māninaḥ.// So one who has fixed up to render service to Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa... //Viṣṇur ārādhyate puṁsāṁ nānyat tat-tosā-kāraṇam.// So this is the ultimate goal of life, to approach Viṣṇu. And the origin of Viṣṇu is Kṛṣṇa. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]], Kṛṣṇa says. Therefore He's origin of Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva. //Sarvasya. Aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. //Devānām// begins... The //devas,// demigods, begins from Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara, then other demigods. So Kṛṣṇa says, //aham ādir hi devānām.//

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"In the Seventh Canto of the //Bhāgavatam,// Sixth Chapter, twenty-third verse [[books:sb:7:6:23|[SB 7.6.23]]], Mahārāja Prahlāda says, 'My dear friends who are born into atheistic families, if you can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, then there is nothing more rare in this world. In other words, if the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa is pleased with you, then any desire that you may have within the core of your heart can be fulfilled without any doubt. As such, what is the use of elevating yourself by the results of fruitive activities, which are automatically achieved in all events by the modes of material nature?' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In the //śāstra// it is said:

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta paramaṁ puruṣa
> [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]

//Akāma.// There are three classes of men. //Akāma,// without //kāma,// without any desire, that is devotees. And //sarva-kāma// means the //karmīs;// and //mokṣa-kāma,// the //jñānīs.// So whatever you may be, you can engage yourself in devotional service.

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta paramaṁ puruṣa
> [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]

Your desires will be fulfilled. Even if you are thinking like //karmī,// still you can take to devotional service; your desires will be fulfilled. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. Whatever you desire, He'll fulfill.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
“ 'And what is the use for you of spiritual emancipation or liberation from material bondage? If you are always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord and always relishing the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord, then there is no necessity for any of these.' By this statement of Prahlāda Mahārāja it is clearly understood that one who takes pleasure in chanting and hearing the transcendental glories of the Lord has already surpassed all kinds of material benediction, including the results of pious activities, pious fruitive activities, sacrifices, and even liberation from material bondage.

"Similarly, in the same Seventh Canto, Eighth Chapter, thirty-ninth verse [[books:sb:7:8:39|[SB 7.8.39]]], when the demigods are offering prayers to Lord Nṛsiṁha, Indra, the King of heaven, says, 'O Supreme One, these demons talk of our share of participation in the performance of ritualistic sacrifices, but simply by Your appearance as Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva You have saved us from terrible fears. Actually our shares in the sacrificial performances are due to You only because You are the Supreme Enjoyer of all sacrifices. You are the Supersoul of every living entity, and therefore You are the actual owner of everything.

Long were our hearts always filled with fear of this demon, Hiraṇyakaśipu. But You are so kind towards us that by killing him, You have removed that fear from within our hearts and have given us the chance to place Your Lordship within our hearts again. For persons who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Your Lordship, all the opulences which were taken away from us by the demons are counted as nothing. Devotees do not even care for liberation, not to speak of these material opulences. Actually we are not enjoyers of the fruits of sacrifice. Our only duty is to always be engaged in Your service, for You are the enjoyer of everything.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"The purport of this statement by Indra is that beginning from Brahmā down to the insignificant ant, no living entities are meant for enjoying the material opulences. They are simply meant for offering everything to the supreme proprietor, the Personality of Godhead. By doing so, they automatically enjoy the benefit. The example can be cited again of the different parts of the body collecting foodstuffs and cooking them so that ultimately a meal may be offered to the stomach. After it has gone to the stomach, all the parts of the bodies..., body equally enjoy the benefit of the meal. So similarly, everyone's duty is to satisfy the Supreme Lord, and then automatically everyone will become satisfied."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is called //yajña. Yajñārthe karma.// Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"A similar verse is found in the Eighth Canto, Third Chapter, of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// verse 20 [[books:sb:8:13:20|[SB 8.13.20]]]. Gajendra says there, 'My dear Lord, I have no experience in the transcendental bliss derived from Your devotional service, so therefore I have asked from You some favor. But I know that persons who are pure devotees and have, by serving the lotus feet of great souls, become freed from all material desires, are always merged in the ocean of transcendental bliss and, as such, are always satisfied simply by glorifying Your auspicious characteristics. For them there is nothing else to aspire to or pray for.'

"In the Ninth Canto of the //Bhāgavatam,// Fourth Chapter, forty-ninth verse [[books:sb:9:4:49|[SB 9.4.49]]], the Lord of Vaikuṇṭha replies to Durvāsā Muni thusly: 'My pure devotees are always satisfied being engaged in devotional service, and therefore they do not aspire even after the five liberated stages, which are (1) to be one with Me, (2) to achieve residence on My planet, (3) to have My opulences, (4) to possess bodily features similar to Mine, and (5) to gain personal association with Me. So when they are not interested even in these liberated positions, you can know how little they care for material opulences or material liberation.'

"There is a similar prayer by the //nāga-patnīs// [wives of the Kāliya serpent], in the Tenth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Sixteenth Chapter, verse 33 [SB 10.16.33]. The //nāga-patnīs// say there, 'My dear Lord, the dust of Your lotus feet is very wonderful. Any person who is fortunate enough to achieve this dust does not care for heavenly planets, lordship over the planetary systems, the mystic perfections of //yoga// or even liberation from the material existence. In other words, anyone who adores the dust of Your lotus feet does not care a fig for all other perfectional stages.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. This was spoken by the //nāga-patnī// when Kāliya was being punished by Lord Kṛṣṇa, kicking over his head. So this prayer was offered, that "For Your dust of Your lotus feet, so many great sages are hankering after, and they do not care for even liberation, simply to get Your that dust of the lotus feet. We do not know how much this fortunate snake is, that he's automatically getting the dust. You are kicking on his head. We do not know what did he do in his previous life that he's so fortunate."

All right. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol.//

[24:10] [//kīrtana//]

**Prabhupāda:**
[//prema-dvani// prayers] Thank you very much. [end]
