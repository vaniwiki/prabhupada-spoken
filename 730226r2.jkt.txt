[Hindi conversation with another guest]

**Guest (1):**
No, I came to beg //namaskār.//

**Amogha:**
Very soon the man from department of religion will be coming.

**Guest (1):**
Minister of religion. [Hindi]

**Amogha:**
Yes.

[Hindi conversation between guests and Śrīla Prabhupāda with occasional English words and phrases interspersed; other guests arrive]

**Prabhupāda:**
Shall we go there so that we can sit comfortably?

**Devotee:**
Well, there're the same amount of chairs whether we're here or there.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, there are no more chairs. [indistinct]

**Devotee:**
Yes, I guess that's best.

**Prabhupāda:**
People are coming, so will you kindly take the trouble to..., inside sitting?

**Guest (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, thank you very much.

[to guest:] You don't take charge of that.

**Amogha:**
We will take. [break]

[people moving around]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Vasudeva make introduction of these gentlemen.

**Amogha:**
Yes. This is Mr. Ivy Mastra, and he is in charge of the Hindu and Buddhist Department of the Department of Religion. And this is his next-in-command, director-general, Mr. G. Puja. He was educated in India also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, really. Which city?

**Mr. G. Puja:**
Benares in the University.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Benares University. That's nice.

**Amogha:**
Actually, they have arranged, by giving a letter, that we can stay in the country. They simply say, "We do not object," and then the immigration gives us a good visa. They especially like your books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, thank you. You have read some of my books?

**Mr. G. Puja:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are not my books; I am simply translating. They are written by Vyāsadeva, the original Vedic scholar. So there are now many secular states. Our Vedic idea of secular state is that government must be responsible for proper execution of religious system. It doesn't matter whether one is Hindu or one is Christian, one is Muhammadan or Buddhist---it doesn't matter---but it is the government duty to see that one who is professing as Hindu, whether he's executing the Hindu principles of religion properly. That is government duty.

Just like government gives license to so many businesses. One man is selling liquor, wine, government issues license. So the government inspector, excise inspector, goes and sees that the man is doing business according to the license. Government should not be callous, that "You may go on with your so-called religion; we don't care for it." No. That is not government. Government's duty is to see.

Just like, for example, Christians, their commandment, first commandment is, "Thou shall not kill." It is the government's duty to see that anyone who is professing Christian, "Why he's killing?" Immediately he should be punished, that "You are professing a Christian and you are killing." This is government. Similarly, Buddhist religion also, //ahiṁsā. Ahiṁsā paramaṁ buddhiḥ.// The government duty should see.

And the ultimate test of first-class religion is: the follower has developed love of God. If he does not know anything about God, or if he has not developed love of God, then he has simply wasted time. It may be any religion. That is ultimate test. Because religion means it has got relationship with God. Otherwise what is the meaning of religion? Any religion, it doesn't matter. The process is quest of God: What is God? What is Absolute Truth? Wherefrom everything has come? What is we... What we are?

What is our relationship with God? This science. Religion means this science. In the //Vedānta-sūtra,// it is said, //athāto brahma jijñāsā.// This human life is meant for understanding the Absolute Truth. Otherwise, what is the difference between cats and dogs and human being? If simply eating, sleeping and sex life and defend is the business of human life, then these things are there in the animal life also. They also eat, they also sleep, they have also sex life, and they also defend according to their capacity. We defend with atomic bomb and they defend their nails and claws. The different spirit is there.

So that is not the aim of human life. The aim of human life---this opportunity's given by nature to have a human form of life---is to understand God. Nobody can deny, unless he is a crazy fellow, the existence of God. That is not possible. There must be. I may know it or not know it, it doesn't matter. Therefore religion means to understand God and to awaken your dormant love for God. This is religion. Now there may be difference of processes, according to country, time, people. Therefore, it is the duty of the government, it is the duty of the government...

[someone enters] Hare Kṛṣṇa.

[pause] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

Formerly the kings, they were regularly supervising whether citizens are properly executing religious culture. That was government's duty. //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. So now government is callous about religion. I'm very glad to know that your government has left some department to supervise. What is your function in this department?

**Mr. Mastra:**
Excuse me, my English is very poor. I would like Mr. Kunti[?] to translate, Indonesian. [Indonesian]

**Amogha:**
He would like to have him translate English to Indonesian.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes?

**Guest (2):**
He is the director of the university of Hindu and Buddhist religion, from Department of Religious Affairs. His duty is to maintain and look after the development of [indistinct] religion and expecting that all people of Indonesia that has to follow any kind of religions, whether it's Christians... Because we have also in-charge for the Christianity, we have also in-charge for the Muslim, or Islam, and we have also in-charge for the Catholic, and we have also in-charge for other...

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good idea. This is very nice.

**Guest (2):**
So because we have so many in the prosecuting of their religions, there might be, the people between many religions, they're called practically worshiper[?]. So the government have to lead the people how actually, to supply also, in the field of their materials for readings, and facilities for their..., prosecuting their religions. This is the actual [indistinct] the government, to have that religions department.

**Prabhupāda:**
So this is the idea which I was explaining, that...

**Guest (2):**
Besides that... [Indonesian] As a matter of fact, also that we are looking from the Hindu and Buddhist religions' point of view, how to get books for this department, especially because we are feeling of lacking of materials because no of our books actually here, written in ancient Indonesian language, which are translated from Sanskrit or re-writed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ancient English...?

**Guest (2):**
Ancient Indonesian language.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā.//

**Guest (2):**
And now, actually, most of the Sanskrit texts, also, are not available anymore. Of course, we have some few can be available from [indistinct] society, and that is why, actually, to develop this Hindu religions, as well as Buddhist religion, which have a lack of material for reading. Now the government also tried to rewrite into Indonesian Bahasa, and as one of the aspects, for example, that //Bhagavad-gītā// has been translated into Indonesian.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Guest (2):**
So in this we are expecting that this //Bhagavad-gītā// should be available in the English [indistinct], and also, matter of fact, most of English readers can understand, and they have the ideas of the //Mahābhārata// and //Rāmāyaṇa,// and the essence of the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Now the problems, at least the department has a lot of facing difficulties to supply the materials that are actually needed by the people, is we are lacking of materials. So how, actually, we have to solve this problem actually.

We are actually, from the government point of view, we are always looking and how we can try to get international relationships between various countries to solve the problems. As the same case also, how to educate Indonesian peoples to study more about the Hinduism in order they can teach the Hinduism, because in our country religious instruction is compulsory in our..., any institution. So we felt, actually, in our lack of material as well as also lack of institution to develop this Hindu religions. And I, from our government, actually, we are expecting your visit here that it will be beneficial, both for our side, from the government point of view, and as well as for here and as well in your country.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I think your problems can be solved if you kindly cooperate with us.

**Guest (2):**
Yes. That's why we are looking for that. Because...

**Prabhupāda:**
We can give you correct idea of religious principles as well as our philosophy.

**Guest (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Religious idea without philosophy is sentiment, and philosophy without religion is mental speculation. They should be combined. Religious idea supported by philosophy, then it is correct. And philosophy without religious idea is simply mental speculation. They should be combined. That combination of religious idea and philosophy you'll find in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// provided you accept //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. If you interpret //Bhagavad-gītā// in your own way, then you'll miss the point. Just like in our country, in India, //Bhagavad-gītā// has been interpreted in so different ways that people are now bewildered. They do not know what is actually //Bhagavad-gītā.//

Take, for example... Just like in the beginning of the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]. I think you know Sanskrit. //Samavetā yuyutsavaḥ māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva kim akurvata sañjaya// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]. Even a great leader, political leader, he has interpreted //kurukṣetra// as this body. So where is the dictionary where //kurukṣetra// means this body? But because he's a big political leader, that //Gītā// is going on: "//Kurukṣetra// means this body; //pāṇḍava// means the five senses." In this way interpreting. Of course, they cannot pull off. I may tell you frankly.

Just like Mahatma Gandhi, he wanted to prove nonviolence from //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā// is spoken in the battlefield, and how he can prove nonviolence from //Bhagavad-gītā?// Then he has to drag some interpretation out of his own way. But because he's a big leader, the people are misled. Similarly, all... At present moment in India the //Bhagavad-gītā// has becoming a plaything, that anyone can interpret in his own way and do all nonsense.

But I'll request you, because you are so much interested, and you have already approved //Bhagavad-gītā,// you have translated, amongst the leading personalities, you try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is and spread it, it will have immediate effect. That is already experimented. Just like in the Western countries, before me, hundreds and thousands //svāmīs// and //yogīs// went there. But not a single person could understand what is //Bhagavad-gītā// and what is Kṛṣṇa. Now hundreds and thousands of these boys in Europe, America, Canada, Africa---everywhere---Australia, everywhere, they are now become devotees like them. So they're intelligent persons, they're coming from rich family. Why they have taken seriously? Because they have understood //Bhagavad-gītā// nicely.

So I request that God is neither Indonesian, neither Indian, neither African. God is God. And He claims that all living entities, in any form... The form is superficial. The form is taken as dress. Just like you are dressed in a different way, I am dressed in different way. But we are not talking to the dress; we are talking to the man who is putting on the dress. Similarly, this bodily distinction is material. But spiritually we are all one. There is no question of becoming Indian or Indonesian or African or Asian or this or that. And that is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā//---you know---//paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ.//

> vidyā-vinaya-sampanne
> brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
> śuni caiva śvapāke ca 
> paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]].

Because //paṇḍita// does not see the outward dress. //Paṇḍita// sees the inside, who is putting on the dress. Therefore, without misinterpreting //Bhagavad-gītā// or being misled by so-called big, big leaders, if you try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, it will be very nice, beneficial to everyone.

That is my..., not opinion; that is the fact. Things should be taken as it is. Call a spade a spade. Now, interpretation is required when things are not clear. When things are not very clear, not easily understood... There is example in Sanskrit grammar, //gaṅgāyāṁ ghoṣa-pāli:// "The neighborhood of //ghoṣa// family is on the Ganges." Now, on the Ganges---Ganges is water---how there can be a village? Now, here interpretation required. When the matter is...

[break] ...on the water, but on the bank of the Ganges.

So when the meaning is not clear, then you can interpret. But when the meaning is clear... Just like //Bhagavad-gītā: dharmakṣetre kurukṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]. Now Kurukṣetra is still there, in..., about ninety miles away from Delhi. Perhaps you have been there. The station is there, Kurukṣetra. Now how one can interpret that //kurukṣetra// means this body? This is going on. In spite of clear understanding, they will interpret in their own way so that they have got their own philosophy, they want to support it. This is going on.

So if you kindly avoid this misleading interpretation, and if you take //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, then you get the science of God, science of religion, which is applicable either to Indonesian or Indian or African or American---everyone. The science is appreciated everywhere. "Two plus two equal to four," this mathematical science is applicable everywhere. It doesn't matter whether one is a Christian or Hindu or Muslim. Similarly, //Bhagavad-gītā// is the science of religion, science of God.

So if you take this book seriously and try to spread this knowledge among your countrymen, I think you'll be very much benefited. And it can be... We are preaching that. We are the..., our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for one God, one scripture, one //mantra,// like that, for all people of the world. And we are happy that people are accepting it in that way, very nicely. And it is very easy. It is very easy. So Mr. Director, he has read //Bhagavad-gītā?//

**Guest (2):**
Yes. He has read it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Guest (2):**
And I think many Indonesian people, actually, have read this //Bhagavad-gītā,// because we have translated that //Bhagavad-gītā// in 1966.

**Prabhupāda:**
I see. Very nice. So have you read our this //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is?//

**Guest (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do you like it?

**Guest (2):**
[indistinct] because when I was in India, that's when [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
So religion must be there. Without religion the human society is animal society. There must be religion. And religion means to know God. That is religion. What is your explanation of religion?

**Guest (2):**
Actually it's a very small thing to define in [indistinct]. Religion has to be defined as a Vedic [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that [indistinct]?

**Guest (2):**
[indistinct] to understand religion is [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They must be the same. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣad bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. Religion means the course, or the laws, given by God. Just like law means the law given by the state. I cannot manufacture law. The citizen cannot manufacture law. The law is manufactured by the legislative assembly of the government. Similarly, religion means the order given by God.

Now we have to understand who is God and what is His order, and how it is applicable to everyone. That is the system of religion. We cannot whimsically give some rituals as religion. The principle of religion is to obey the orders of God. Therefore the first principle is to know who is God. Unless I know what is God, then how I can know what is His order?

So in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// the religion is given that...

[aside:] You are feeling sleepy, you can go.

The //Bhagavad-gītā,// it is said that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. That is religion. We have manufactured so many types of religion, and here God says that "You give up your manufactured religion. You just surrender unto Me." This is religion. Religion means to surrender. A good citizen means to surrender to the government laws. Similarly, a religious person means who has surrendered to God.

Nowadays it has become a regrettable fashion that everyone is God, when we surrender to one. And this false prestige that "I am God. I haven't got to surrender to anyone. I am God. What surrender?" this atheism is going on and spoiling the whole human society. God has become so cheap thing, any nonsense can claim, "I am God." That is the defect of the modern society. There is a great necessity to understand God. If everyone is God, then where is the necessity of religion? If everyone is president, then where is the necessity of lawmaking? So this is going on. This is very unfortunate situation. What is your idea?

**Guest (2):**
[indistinct] translator in our Hindu text, for example, that when it's expressed //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// so...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ahaṁ brahmāsmi// is the Vedic version, that is all right. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi// means "I am spirit. I am not this body." //So 'ham// means "I am the same quality as God." But they are misinterpretation: //so 'ham// means, "I am God." This is nonsense. This is going on.

**Guest (2):**
That's misleading.

**Prabhupāda:**
Misleading, and people have become nonsense. [conversation between the two Indonesian guests in Indonesian] You have published //Bhagavad-gītā// with commentary or simple translation?

**Guest (2):**
With commentaries.

**Prabhupāda:**
So whose commentary you have followed?

**Guest (2):**
We try to take from various books, and we try... At first we have to understand clearly their positions, and then we put them in a simple way that everybody can understand it clearly. Only the part that's very difficult to realize.

**Prabhupāda:**
So now here, //Bhagavad-gītā,// in the Fourth Chapter it is said, //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]].

[to devotee:] You can open this Fourth Chapter.

**Guest (2):**
First thing, Swāmī, that according to our opinions that religion is something that true living.

**Prabhupāda:**
Something?

**Guest (2):**
Something that we should live truly.

**Prabhupāda:**
True living. Yes. True, just like good citizens...

**Guest (2):**
That's right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Good citizenship means living under the direction of the government. That is good citizenship. Similarly, human life means to live nicely under the direction of God. The cats and dogs, they cannot understand. But the human life...

[pause]

Now where is Fourth Chapter I don't see.

[aside:] That first verse:

> imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
> proktavān aham avyayam
> vivasvān manave prāha
> manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt
> [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]

So what is your explanation of this verse?

**Guest (2):**
You want to explain this into, er... Do you want to explain this?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

> imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
> proktavān aham avyayam
> vivasvān manave prāha 
> manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt
> [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]

**Guest (2):**
Yes. This actually is explaining the origins of the law, ancient law, that's obeyed by the man. It's the law given from the Vedic literature...

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa.

**Guest (2):**
Yes. Kṛṣṇa [indistinct] and coming to Ikṣvāku and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that [indistinct] means, that means this knowledge should be received from the authority.

**Guest (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like...

**Guest (2):**
So actually they have acquired it from one source.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. One link. So that is being deviated. What Kṛṣṇa said to Vivasvān, to the sun-god, now everyone is speaking in his own way, not in that way.

**Guest (2):**
That's right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore it is deviated. The //Bhagavad-gītā,// the Chapter, Fourth Chapter, explains that you cannot understand //Bhagavad-gītā// by your own interpretation. You must follow the instruction of the original speaker of //Bhagavad-gītā.// The original speaker is Kṛṣṇa. So what Kṛṣṇa says, they have to follow it. Then it is //Bhagavad-gītā.// Otherwise, if you interpret it in a different way, then it is not //Bhagavad-gītā.//

Now, what Kṛṣṇa says, we have to understand it philosophically, ethically, scientifically, any way, any angle of vision. That is..., that you can do. But you cannot change the version of //Bhagavad-gītā.// You cannot change. Just like Dr. Radhakrishnan, in the Ninth Chapter, when Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], Dr. Radhakrishnan says, "It is not to the Kṛṣṇa person."

But Kṛṣṇa person says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:// "You just always think of Me." And he's deviating his readers, "Not to Kṛṣṇa." How much harm he's doing. This is going on. Why? It is said, Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ,// "Just think of Me. Just become My devotee." What right he has got to say that here it is not to Kṛṣṇa? This is going on.

So if we interpret in that nonsense way then we shall not be able to understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// We shall miss this... Science does not mean that you have to change according to your whims. "Two plus two equal to four." You cannot make it "five" or "three." That is not possible. Then it is not science; no longer the scientific value of this "two plus two" remains. We follow that principle, and that is the only principle.

So if you're actually serious about //Bhagavad-gītā//---I do not know what is your commentary---I request you, "Try to follow the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. Don't interpret in your own way." Then it will be missing. Everyone has got [indistinct] all over the world. Therefore we are selling this //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// very nicely. Our publisher is Macmillan Company, and their trades manager's report is that our //Bhagavad-gītā// is increasing daily, sales; other decreasing. That is the report.

And in October they published 50,000 copies, it is already finished. Now they have to plan it for the second edition. People are very much, now, eager to read //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.// So, imitating us, somebody's, another [chuckles] man, he said, "//Bhagavad-gītā// As It Was." [laughs with everyone] Like that. So that will not harm our cause.

[Indonesian with other guest]

**Guest (2):**
One thing Mr. [indistinct] would like to have answer from you, that, according to different view, objective reply, the object of religion is [indistinct] life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Guest (2):**
The objective of religion is to be prosperous in this world and hereafter.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. This is [indistinct]. Prosperous... That is also stated, how you can become prosperous. That...

**Guest (2):**
The problems work like this...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That is also stated...

**Guest (2):**
Whether this question also...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. This is there...

**Guest (2):**
This what it is.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// you'll find this verse.

[aside:] Find out. //Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram.//

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ 
> sarva-loka-maheśvaram
> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati
> [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]

This is the //śānti,// prosperity. They are... Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the Supreme Enjoyer. I am the sole proprietor of everything." //Sarva-loka-maheśvaram. Sarva-loka:// not only of this planet, but other planets also. //Loka. Loka// means planet. //Sarva-lokam.// So //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram, suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām:// "I am the most," I mean to say, "well-wisher friend of everyone." //Jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati.//

If one understands these three things only: that God is the Supreme Enjoyer... We are not enjoyer, but God is enjoyer. That God is the proprietor of everything, not we are proprietor. We are subordinate. In the //Vedas// also, it is stated, //eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān. Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. The description of God is like that: He's eternal amongst the eternals. We are also eternal, we living entities, and God is also eternal. //Nityo nityānāṁ..., cetana:// He's the vital living force among all living forces. Here all living forces, and He's the chief living force.

Then what is the distinction between this singular number //nitya// and the plural number //nityas?// The distinction is that that singular number //nitya// is maintaining these plural number //nityas. Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. Then the distinction. Otherwise, God is also a living entity like us, like one of us, but He's the chief. Just like father and children. Father is the chief man in the family, and he's providing all necessities to life for the children, for the wife's families. Although the father is also living entity and the children are also living entities, but the father is providing the children, and the children are being provided by the father.

So this is the understanding. Unless we understand this, there cannot be any peace. That is the Vedic version. Anyone who understands this, he gets peace. Otherwise there's no possibility of peace. If I think that I am the proprietor, if I think that I am the enjoyer, or, in other words, I am God, then you'll never get peace. That is not possible. That is a false. If one of the children thinks that "I am the independent," then naturally father will say, "All right, if you're independent, do your own business." This is an example.

So if you want peace, then, as it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// you have to learn these three things. It is not very difficult: to accept God as the Supreme Enjoyer, and God is the sole proprietor of everything, and He's the best friend of everyone. Then you have peace. Anyone can appreciate this. Anyone can adopt this principle and he'll be in peace. And so long one will falsely think that "I am God. I am enjoyer. I am this, I am that," then he'll suffer. False notion will never make him happy. He must come to the true, factual idea.

Now then, you can examine that Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the Supreme Enjoyer." Now let us understand this one fact, how Kṛṣṇa's the enjoyer. Now suppose here is some banana fruits. Who has created this banana fruit? You are not manufacturer, I am not manufacturer. Somebody has created. We accept God has created, and that's a fact. Then who should be the enjoyer? I shall be enjoyer or God shall be enjoyer? Anything you create, you become the enjoyer. Anything I create, I become the enjoyer. So if God has created this banana fruit, then who should be enjoyer? God or I?

**Guest (2):**
God. It should be God. God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So our business is, we should offer this banana to God: "Sir, it is Your creation, it is Your thing. First of all You taste it, then we take it." Then you become in peace. And if you falsely think that "I have created this banana tree. I have worked so hard. Now the fruit is there. Now I am the enjoyer," then you are mistaken. Then next statement is, //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka maheś...// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]], "I am the proprietor of everything in the world." Now, beginning of this world, //bhūmi,// land, this land, they're claiming this land Indonesian, this land American, this land Indian. But has the Indonesians or the Africans or the Indians created this land? Who has created this land?

**Guest (2):**
God.

**Prabhupāda:**
God. Then He must be proprietor. But we are falsely claiming, "I am the proprietor." So how you can be in peace? Suppose you steal something, somebody's property, and falsely claim, "I am proprietor," you'll never be peace, because it is not your thing; you have stolen it. So in this way, if you philosophically study that God is the Supreme Proprietor, //tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]], you can simply use what is given to you. You cannot claim other's property. Just like in animal life, animal life, they do not claim "This is my country." The birds, they do not claim, but they live very peacefully. There are crows, there are spa... What is called? So many birds, they live anywhere, everywhere, but they do not claim, "Oh, this is my country. This is my place." They do not claim. Therefore they are free to move everywhere.

So we have created a situation, godless situation; therefore we are not in peace. So therefore, if you want peace, you must accept God, first of all. //Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. This is the way of //śānti.// You cannot create your //śānti// in your own way. That is not possible. Just like the citizens, if they create their own way of //śānti,// there cannot be peace. If they abide by the orders of the government, by the laws of the government, there will be peace. This is crude example. Similarly, if we do not accept God in the center as the Supreme Proprietor and the Supreme Enjoyer and the Supreme Friend, then there is no peace. This is the problem, I have given in the... What is that? Read it?

Translation: "The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, obtain peace from the pangs of material miseries."

**Prabhupāda:**
Purport.

**Devotee:**
"The conditioned souls in the clutches of the illusory energy are all anxious to attain peace in the material world. They do not know the formula for peace, which is explained in this part of the //Bhagavad-gītā.// The greatest peace formula is simply this: Lord Kṛṣṇa is the beneficiary in all human activities. Men should offer everything to the transcendental service of the Lord because He is the proprietor of all planets and the demigods thereon. No one is greater than He. He is greater than the greatest of the demigods, Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā.

"In the //Vedas// the Supreme Lord is described as //param īśvarānāṁ paramaṁ maheśvaram.// Under the spell of illusion, living entities are trying to be lords of all they survey. But actually they are dominated by the material energy of the Lord. The Lord is the master of material nature, and the conditioned souls are under the stringent rules of material nature."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the defect. Lord is the master of material nature, and we are conditioned by the material nature, and still we are claiming, "I am God." Then?

**Devotee:**
"Unless one understands these bare facts, it is not possible to achieve peace in the world, either individually or collectively. This is the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Lord Kṛṣṇa is the supreme predominator, and all living entities, including the great demigods, are His subordinates. One can attain perfect peace only in complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

"In the Fifth Chapter is the practical explanation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, generally known as //karma-yoga.// The question of mental speculation as to how //karma-yoga// can give liberation is answered herewith. To work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to work with the complete knowledge that the Lord is the predominator. Such work is not different from transcendental knowledge.

"Direct Kṛṣṇa consciousness is //bhakti-yoga,// and //jñāna-yoga// is the path leading to //bhakti-yoga.// Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to work in full knowledge of one's relationship with the Supreme Absolute, and the perfection of this consciousness is full knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

"A pure soul is the eternal servant of God as His fragmental part and parcel. He comes into contact with //māyā,// illusion, due to the desire to lord it over //māyā.// And that is the cause of his many sufferings. As long as he is in contact with matter he has to execute work in terms of material necessities. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, brings one into spiritual life even while he is within the jurisdiction of matter, for it is an arousing of spiritual existence by practice in the material world.

"The more one is advanced, the more he is free from the clutches of matter. The Lord is not partial toward anyone. Everything depends on one's practical performance of duties in an effort to control the senses and conquer the influence of desire and anger. And attaining Kṛṣṇa consciousness by controlling the above-mentioned passions, one remains factually in the transcendental stage of //brahma-nirvāṇa.//

"The eight-fold //yoga// mysticism is automatically practiced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness because the ultimate purpose is served. There's a gradual process of elevation in the practice of //yama, niyama, āsana, pratyāhāra, dhyāna, dhāraṇā, prāṇāyāma// and //samādhi.// But these only preface perfection by devotional service, which alone can award peace to the human being. It is the highest perfection of life."

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore in another place it is stated, //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]: "After many, many births, when actually becomes wise, //jñānavān, māṁ prapadyate,// he surrenders unto Me." That is the perfection of knowledge.

So this is... This //Bhagavad-gītā// is the only source of scientific knowledge of God and our relationship with God. I am very glad that you are already very serious about understanding //Bhagavad-gītā.// But I request you only that try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// without any our man-made interpretation. That will be my request.

**Guest (2):**
What is one thing that I would like to...

**Prabhupāda:**
And we are always ready to help you in this.

**Guest (2):**
Yes, thank you for this. What I wanted, that Gurujī will be able to help us...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

**Guest (2):**
...in establishing, for example, that //Gītā// meeting for some...

**Prabhupāda:**

**Guest (2):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. [indistinct] Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is practically preaching the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. And it is coming fruitful. It is coming very fruitful.

[conversation in Indonesian between guests]

**Prabhupāda:**
Please translate.

**Guest (2):**
[Indonesian] He said, as a matter of fact, this Hindu religion in Indonesia, actually, most of them practicing //Bhagavad-gītā.// So //Bhagavad-gītā// has been a part of their life. But as a matter of due course, in practicing this //Bhagavad-gītā,// not all complete path has been practiced, but only part by path which is very necessary for the adjustment with the condition in Indonesia. And some of them, of course, they can memorizing the verses for their benefit in their practices. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
So we are always prepared to help you, anytime you require our help. We shall try, we shall very much try to explain //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is.

**Guest (2):**
Thank you.

[sounds of guests leaving]
