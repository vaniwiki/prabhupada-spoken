[Prabhupāda plays harmonium; no singing]

**Amogha:**
I can bring another...

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't... [indistinct]

**Amogha:**
Will you keep the [indistinct] Śrīla Prabhupāda [break]?

[01:40]

**Prabhupāda:**
...for propagating our mission because the state is inclined to take the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā.// They have found that this is the wisest group of [indistinct]. Take advantage of this opportunity and propagate in schools, colleges, for teaching and introducing our books. [indistinct] They have already translated //Bhagavad-gītā.// They have got very good results...

**Amogha:**
There are three translations. In this language there are three translations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Three?

**Amogha:**
Translations. Three editions by different authors in Indonesian language. The most recent... I will try to contact the author today, the man who translated it. I'll try to find him.

**Prabhupāda:**
But unless one is realized soul, how he can...

**Amogha:**
He cannot. It is impersonal interpretations.

**Devotee (2):**
So we must encourage them to translate Prabhupāda's //Bhagavad-gītā,// because they're inclined. They like... They want subject matters. So why not translate Prabhupāda's books and let the government distribute them and introduce them?

**Amogha:**
Only they several times suggest to me that we donate the books, because they don't have money to print their own books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Amogha:**
They have not facilities, money, to actually print and publish and distribute. That is why they are so attracted to us, because we have the books, and they know we have the power to print and distribute. But they have no money, no power to do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. If they want, we can do that.

**Amogha:**
Yeah.

**Devotee:**
Tell them to translate, and we can publish it.

**Prabhupāda:**
We can [indistinct]. It the government sponsor, then we can invest money and everything.

**Amogha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
We can print.

**Amogha:**
Dai Nippon, we have credit also.

**Prabhupāda:**
We can do anywhere. That is the difference. As far as the government must encourage it. As soon as we translate and distribute, they should give us full facilities.

**Amogha:**
Full facilities for...

**Prabhupāda:**
All the schools, colleges will take it.

**Amogha:**
Oh, yes. I see. I see.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can distribute at cost price. That we can do.

**Amogha:**
They should read it all over this country. They...

**Prabhupāda:**
All over the world. It is, what is called, spiritual bankruptcy all over the world, and leading men are thinking this catastrophe, and the only hope is //Bhagavad-gītā.// Because in any religion, there is no science. There is no philosophy. Buddhist religion there is little development science. Otherwise... [indistinct]

**Amogha:**
They are bankrupt and we are billionaire in spiritual life.

[pause]

Tomorrow the Professor of Sanskrit has made appointment, a lady from University of Indonesia. She speaks English very well also.

[pause]

I will go speak with them, see if they can bring that author.

[offers obeisances] [break] [end]
