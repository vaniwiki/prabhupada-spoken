**Prabhupāda:**
...he was personal friend of Kṛṣṇa. Just try to understand how much qualified he was. Not only that; he belonged to the royal family, he was a great warrior, great hero, so many qualities. But he said that "I cannot practice this //yoga// system. It is not possible. I cannot control my mind and practice this //haṭha-yoga// system." Now just try to understand. He is such a personality, great personality, and five thousand years ago, when things were so nice. So at that time a person like Arjuna felt that he's unable to practice this //yoga// system. And nowadays a paltry people with teeny knowledge, they are trying to practice //yoga// system as if they're..., he has become more than Arjuna.

It is very difficult subject matter. It is not possible for ordinary man. The first principle is that he has to sit down alone in a sacred place, alone. //Yoga// practice is not possible in a big city, with friends and smoking habit and drinking habit. This all farce. One has to become very strong in controlling the mind, controlling the senses, sitting in a solitary place, sacred place like Himalaya or Haridwar, like that. And who is going there, and who is practicing? It is not possible. Not only that; he has to sit down straight, and not bending, and looking on the tip of the nose, and not closing the eyes completely, half closed---so many rules and regulation---and always thinking of Viṣṇu. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā pra...// [SB 12.13.1]. It is not possible. This //yoga// system, Arjuna denied five thousand years ago. And what we are? This is going on, all farce.

Here is the //yoga// system Kṛṣṇa is describing, //sa ma guhyatamam,// most confidential //yoga// system. What is that? //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]: "Simply always think of Me." //Man-manā. Mad-bhakta:// "You just become My devotee." So this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Even I don't like it think Kṛṣṇa, as soon as the name is chanted immediately I'm forced to think of Kṛṣṇa, immediately. Hare Kṛṣṇa, as I say, immediately I remember Kṛṣṇa, //man-manā.//

Not only that; a devotee thinks of Kṛṣṇa because he develops love for Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as we develop our love for Kṛṣṇa, we must have to think of Kṛṣṇa. Just like we think of our lover, beloved, always; similarly, by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// we develop our love for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore as soon as you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, you immediately remember Kṛṣṇa. That is //man-manā.// And unless I have developed devotional service, then how I can chant //Kṛṣṇa?// Just like they are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. But I am advising everyone. But we, who others are chanting, they are not chanting, because they have no love for Kṛṣṇa. Ah.

So //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. And how it is prac... How it is? By worshiping Kṛṣṇa. Just like we have got our temple, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple, and from morning, four o'clock, to night ten o'clock, they have got business how to worship Kṛṣṇa. This time //ārati,// this time //bhoga,// this time chanting, this time reading about Kṛṣṇa, understanding about Kṛṣṇa---whole day and night we have got prescription. If you come to our temple in the foreign countries, you'll be pleased to see how they are doing.

So these are the processes, confidential, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. It does not require any high education. To think of Kṛṣṇa, any child can do. To chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, any child can do. It is not difficult. And to offer obeisances before the Lord Kṛṣṇa's Deity in the temple, anyone can do. Where is the difficulty? //Mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru,// simply by offering obeisances, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's picture.

Let me offer my obeisances." Simple thing. //Man-manā bhava mad-bha...,// the most confidential. The result? What will be the result? Result is //mām evaiṣyasi satyam:// "I tell you, without any desire to cheat you, //satyam,// the truth that he'll come back, back to home, back to Godhead." Simply by executing these four principles---always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, //man-manā;// becoming devotee of Kṛṣṇa; following the devotional process, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ... Viṣṇu// means Kṛṣṇa. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam.// Just hear about Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

> śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
> smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam
> arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyam...
> [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]

Take any one of them or nine of them, His devotee, //bhagavad-bhakta.// The result will be //mām evaiṣyasi satyam,// "I don't cheat you." Kṛṣṇa is not cheating anyone. Still He says that "Don't think I am a cheater. //Satyam.// Yes. Truly you'll come back to Me." //Mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te pratijāne priyo 'si me.// "And why You are disclosing this confidential knowledge to me?" //Priyo 'si me:// "You are My very dear friend." Somehow or other you become dear friend of Kṛṣṇa and He's within you. He'll always talk with you, most confidentially, and your life will be successful. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

But unfortunately, people are not prepared to accept this simple thing and make his life successful. Still we are canvassing door to door, country to country, that "You accept this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and you'll be happy in your life," not only this life, next life. That is is perfection of life.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Amogha:**
Would anyone like to ask questions to His Divine Grace?

[pause]

This is Śrīla Prabhupāda's last public speaking engagement before he goes to India, so it's the only opportunity you'll have to ask any questions if you have any.

**Indian man:**
If someone cannot chant sixteen rounds a day...

**Prabhupāda:**
I never said that sixteen round. I say chant. Sixteen rounds is not very difficult. But we say chant. You begin chanting. How many rounds, that doesn't matter. You go on chanting.

**Indian man:**
And I suppose when a [indistinct] of //Bhagavad-gītā// in any language. is it the proper one?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, if the translation is all right, it is proper. But there are so many rubbish translation. You see? There are so many rubbish translation. Misinterpretation. That is dangerous. Translation, if there is right translation, it is all right.

**Guest:**
What is [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] means type.

**Guest:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is all right.

**Guest:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

[pause]

Any more?

**Indian man (2):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is later on. That is later on. Later on. But in the beginning you simply chant.

**Guest (3):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. These are the principles for the initiated disciples. Initiated disciples. Those who are very serious, for them.

**Guest (3):**
Is it necessary [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
Necessarily it is... Just like if you become a policeman, the uniform is necessary.

**Guest (3):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is not necessary, at the same time necessary. It is not necessary, but at the same time necessary.

[pause]

You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
