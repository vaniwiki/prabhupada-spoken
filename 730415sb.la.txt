[devotees chant verse; Prabhupada corrects pronunciation of a number of devotees]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Now, word meanings.

**Pradyumna:**
//yathā//---as it were; //hṛṣīkeśa//---the master of the senses; //khalena//---by the envious; //devakī//---Devakī (the mother of Śrī Kṛṣṇa); //kaṁsena//---by King Kaṁsa; //ruddhā//---imprisoned; //ati-ciram//---for a long time; //śuca-arpitā//---distressed; //vimocitā//---released; //aham ca//---also myself; //saha-ātma-jā//---along with my children; //vibho//---O great one; //tvayā eva//---by Your Lordship; //nāthena//---as the protector; //muhuḥ//---constantly; //vipat-gaṇāt//---series of dangers.

[13:36]

Translation: "O Hṛṣīkeśa, master of the senses and Lord of lords, You have released Your mother, Devakī, who was long imprisoned and distressed by the envious King Kaṁsa, and myself and my children from a series of constant dangers."

**Prabhupāda:**
So this is the position of devotees, that Devakī, who happens to be the mother of Kṛṣṇa... She's not ordinary woman. Who can become the mother of the Supreme Personality of Godhead? The most advanced devotee, so that Kṛṣṇa has agreed to become her son. In his previous life, the husband and wife, they underwent severe austerities, and when Kṛṣṇa appeared before them and wanted to give them benediction, they wanted a son like God. So where can be another person who is equal to God? That is not possible.

"God" means there is no equal, there is no greater. //Asama-urdhva.// That is God. God, there cannot be any competition, that "You are God, I am God, he is God, he is God." No. These are dogs. They are not God. God means without competition: one. God is one. Nobody is great... //Asamordhva:// nobody is greater than Him. Nobody is equal to Him. Everyone is lower. //Ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa āra saba bhṛtya// [[books:cc:adi:5:142|[Cc. Ādi 5.142]]]. The only master is Kṛṣṇa, God; and everyone, servant. Never mind even if he's Brahmā, Viṣṇu or Śiva, big, big demigods. And what to speak of others?

//Śiva-viriñci-nutam// [SB 11.5.33]. In the //śāstra// it is said that He's offered respect by Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. They are the topmost demigods. There are demigods. Above the human being, there are demigods. As we are human being, above the lower creatures, lower animals, similarly, above us there are demigods. And the most important demigod is Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva. Lord Brahmā is the creator of this universe, and Lord Śiva is the destroyer of this universe. And Lord Viṣṇu is the maintainer. Lord Viṣṇu is Kṛṣṇa Himself.

So for the maintenance of this material world there are three //guṇas: sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// So each one of them has taken charge of one department. So Lord Viṣṇu has taken the department of //sattva-guṇa,// and Lord Brahmā has taken the department of //rajo-guṇa,// and Lord Śiva has taken the department of //tamo-guṇa.// They are not under the influence of these //guṇas.// Just like a..., the superintendent of jail. He's not a prisoner; he's controlling officer. Similarly Lord Śiva, Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Brahmā, although they are controlling each department, they are not under the controlling department. We may not commit mistake.

So Hṛṣīkeśa. Kṛṣṇa is the supreme controller. //Hṛṣīka, hṛṣīka// means senses. So we are enjoying our senses, but ultimately the controller is Kṛṣṇa. Suppose this is my hand. I'm claiming it is my hand: "I shall give you a good fist on your..." I'm very much proud. But I am not controller. The controller is Kṛṣṇa. If you..., if He withdraws the power of the activity of your arm, you become paralyzed. Although you are claiming, "It is my hand. I shall use it," but when it is paralyzed, you cannot do anything. Therefore I may have possessed this hand by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, but I am not the controller. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Therefore a sane man will think that ultimately if this hand is to be controlled by Kṛṣṇa, then it is meant for Kṛṣṇa. This is the commonsense understanding. I am claiming that "This is my hand, this is my leg, this is my ear." Even children says. You ask the children, "What is this?" "It is my hand." But we may claim, but actually it is not our hand. It is given for... Because I wanted to use my hands in so many ways, Kṛṣṇa has given: "All right, you take this hand. Use it." So it is gift of Kṛṣṇa.

Therefore a sane man is always conscious that "Whatever I have got in my possession---first of all this body and senses---they are actually not mine. I have given all these possession for utility. So if ultimately everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, why it is not utilized for Kṛṣṇa?" That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is intelligence. If I am given all these things for my use, for my sense gratification, but ultimately it belongs to Kṛṣṇa... //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. Everyone is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, so everyone's senses are also Kṛṣṇa's. So when..., when the senses are utilized for Kṛṣṇa's service, that is perfection of life. And so long it is utilized for my sense gratification, it is //māyā.//

Therefore //bhakti// means //hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Hṛṣīkeṇa,// by the senses, this //hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam,// when you serve Hṛṣīkeśa, really master of the senses, that is called //bhakti.// Very simple description, definition of //bhakti. Hṛṣīkeṇa..., hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam. Hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam.// Not //hṛṣīka-sevanam. Hṛṣīka// means senses. So when senses are used for sense gratification, that is //māyā.// And when senses are used for the gratification of the master of the senses, that is called //bhakti.// Very simple definition. Anyone can understand.

So generally, in this material world, everyone is using the senses for sense gratification. That's all. That is their bondage. That is //māyā,// illusion. And when he comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, purified, when he understands that actually these senses are meant for satisfying Kṛṣṇa, then he's liberated person, //mukta. Mukta-puruṣa,// liberated person. //Īhā yasya harer dāsye karmaṇā manasā vācā// [Brs. 1.2.187]. When one comes to this position, that "My senses are meant for serving the master of the senses, Hṛṣīkeśa..." The master of the senses are..., is sitting within your heart. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ:// "I am seated in everyone's heart." //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]: "From Me remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness is coming." So why that? Because Kṛṣṇa is so merciful, if I want to use my senses in a certain way... Not my senses; it is Kṛṣṇa's, given. So Kṛṣṇa gives the chance: "All right, utilize it." Suppose I have got tongue. If I want, "Kṛṣṇa, I want to eat stool. I want to taste stool," "Yes," Kṛṣṇa will say. "Yes, you take this body of hog, and eat stool." The master is there, Kṛṣṇa.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. He gives you the body, reminds you, "My dear living entity, you wanted to eat stool? Now you have got a proper body. Now utilize. Here is stool also." Similarly, if you want to become demigod, that also Kṛṣṇa gives you chance. Anything... There are 8,400[000] forms of life. If you want to engage your senses in any type of body, Kṛṣṇa is giving you: "Come on. Here is the body. You take." But we become exasperated by using our senses. Ultimately we become senseless.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "Don't do like this. Your senses are meant for serving Me. So you are misusing it. By misusing, you are being entrapped in different types of body. Therefore to get relief from this tedious business of accepting one body and giving it up, again another body, again another..., to continue this material existence, if you give up this process of sense gratification and surrender unto Me, then you are saved." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So at the present moment, our senses are contaminated. I am thinking, "I am American, so my senses should be utilized for the service of my country, my society, my nation." Big, big leaders, big, big so many things. So the real concept is that "I am American, so my senses are American senses. So it must be utilized for America." Similarly, Indians thinking, others are thinking. But none of them do know it that senses belong to Kṛṣṇa. This is ignorance. No intelligence. They are thinking for the time being that these senses, //upādhi,// designated: American senses, Indian senses, African senses. No. This is called //māyā.// It is covered.

Therefore //bhakti// means //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. When your senses will be uncontaminated with all these designation, that is the beginning of //bhakti.// If I think, "I am American. Why shall I take Kṛṣṇa consciousness? It is Hindu God," that is foolishness. If I think, "I am Muhammadan," "I am Christian," then you are gone. But if we purify the senses, that "I am spirit soul. The Supreme Spirit Soul is Kṛṣṇa. I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa; therefore it is my duty to serve Kṛṣṇa," then you become free immediately. Immediately. You are no more American, Indian or African or this or that. You are Kṛṣṇized, Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is wanted.

Therefore Kuntīdevī says, "Hṛṣīkeśa, my dear Kṛṣṇa, You are the master of the senses, and for the sense gratification we are fallen in this material condition of life, different varieties of life." So we are suffering, and suffering to the extent... Even one becomes Kṛṣṇa's mother. Because this is material world, she's also put into suffering, what to speak of others? Devakī is so advanced that she has become the mother of Kṛṣṇa, but still [s]he's put into difficulties. And difficulties by whom? By his [her] brother, Kaṁsa.

So this world is like that. Try to understand. Even you become Kṛṣṇa's mother, and even your brother, who is very nearest relative. So you..., the world is such jealous that if one's personal interest is hampered, everyone will be ready to give you trouble. This is the world. Everyone. Even if he's brother, even he's father. What to speak of others? //Khalena. Khala// means jealous. This material world is jealous, envious. I am envious of you; you are envious of me. This is our business. This is our business.

Therefore this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for such person who is no more jealous, who's no more envious. Perfect person. //Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vāstavaṁ vastu vedyam atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. Those who are jealous and envious, they are within this material world. And those who are not jealous, they are in the spiritual world. Simple thing. You test yourself, "Whether I am jealous, envious of my other associates, friends, everything?" Then I am in the material world. And if I am not jealous, then I'm in the spiritual world. Anyone can test. There is no question of whether I'm spiritually advanced or not. You can test yourself. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42].

Just like if you are eating, you'll understand whether you are satisfied, whether your hunger is satisfied. You haven't got to take certificate from others. Similarly, if you test yourself whether you are jealous, whether you are envious, then you are in the material world. And if you are not jealous, if you are not envious, then in the spiritual world. Then you can serve Kṛṣṇa very nicely if you are not jealous. Because our jealous, enviousness has begin, began from Kṛṣṇa. Just like the Māyāvādī: "Why Kṛṣṇa shall be God? I am..., I am also God. I am also."

So this is the beginning of material life: to become envious of Kṛṣṇa."Why Kṛṣṇa shall be enjoyer? I shall be enjoyer. Why Kṛṣṇa shall enjoy the //gopīs?// I shall become Kṛṣṇa and enjoy, make a society of //gopīs// and enjoy." This is //māyā.// Nobody can be enjoyer. Kṛṣṇa therefore says, //bhoktāraṁ yajña...// Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the only enjoyer. And if we supply ingredients for His enjoyment, that is our perfection of life. And if we want to imitate Kṛṣṇa, that "I shall become a God. I shall become an imitator enjoyer," then you are in the //māyā.// Simply our business is...

Just like the //gopīs'// life. Kṛṣṇa is enjoying, and they're supplying the ingredients of enjoyment. Yes. This is //bhakti.// We are meant for... Kṛṣṇa is supplying... The servant and master. The servant is being supplied all the necessities by the master, but the servant's duty is to serve the master. That's all. //Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān, nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām...// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. These are the Vedic inform... Kṛṣṇa is supplying you immense..., all the necessities of life. There is no scarcity. There is no economic problem. You simply try to serve Kṛṣṇa, then everything is complete. Because He's Hṛṣīkeśa. And so much... If Kṛṣṇa desires, there may be ample supplies.

Just like in your country, there is ample supplies. In other country... I went to Switzerland: everything is imported. No supply. The supply is only..., only snow. [laughter] Take as much snow as you like. You see? Similarly, everything is under the control of Kṛṣṇa. If you become devotee, then there is no snow supply---simply food supply. And if you don't become devotee, be covered with snow. That's all. Covered with cloud. Everything is under Kṛṣṇa's control.

So actually there is no scarcity. The scarcity is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious then everything is ample. There is no scarcity. This is the process. //Tvayā hṛṣīkeśa...// And here it is said: //tvayā hṛṣī..., yathā hṛṣīkeśa khalena devakī.// The world is full of dangers. But Devakī... Kuntīdevī says, "But because Devakī is Your devotee, You saved her from the distresses offered by her envious brother." As soon as the brother heard that "My sister's son, eighth son of my sister, will kill me," oh, he was ready immediately to kill Devakī. So he was pacified by Devakī's husband. It is the duty of the husband to give protection. "So my dear brother-in-law, why you are envious to your sister? After all, your sister will not kill you. Her son will kill you. That is the problem. So I shall deliver all the sons to you, then you can do whatever you like. Why you are killing this innocent girl, newly married? She is your younger sister, just like your daughter. You should give her protection. What you are doing this?"

So Kaṁsa became pacified. He believed in the words of Vasudeva, that he'll deliver all the sons, "And if you like, can kill." He thought, "Let me save the present situation. After all, later on, mean, Kaṁsa gets a nephew; he may forget this enviousness." But he's never, never to forget. Yes. He killed all the sons and kept them in prison. //Śucārpitā badhyā ati-ciram. Ati-ciram// means for long time. So [s]he was saved. Devakī was saved after all.

Similarly, if we take the position of Devakī and Kuntī... Kuntī, just like with her sons, Pañca-Pāṇḍava, five Pāṇḍavas... After she became widow, the whole plan was, Dhṛtarāṣṭra's, "How to kill these children of my younger brother? Because, by chance, I was blind, so I could not get the throne of the kingdom. My younger brother got it. Now he's dead. So at least my sons, they should get the throne." That was his policy, Dhṛtarāṣṭra's policy: "I could not get." This is material propensities. "I shall be happy. My sons shall be happy. My community shall be happy. My nation shall be happy." These are extended selfishness.

Nobody's thinking Kṛṣṇa..., how Kṛṣṇa will be happy. Everyone is thinking in his own terms: "How I shall be happy, how my children shall be happy, my community shall be happy, my society shall be happy, my nation..." This is the struggle for existence. Everywhere you'll find it. This is material existence. Nobody's thinking how Kṛṣṇa will be happy.

Therefore this Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very sublime. Try to understand from //Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā.// And //hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]], and try to engage your senses for the service of the master of the senses. Then you'll be happy.

Thank you very much.
