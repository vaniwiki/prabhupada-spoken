**Prabhupāda:**
When Kuvera wanted to give benediction to Dhruva Mahārāja, Dhruva Mahārāja was very angry and was killing the descendants of Kuvera. And their offended the descendants of Kuvera killed Dhruva Mahārāja's brother; therefore he was retaliating. At that time somebody requested--- Brahmā, I think---requested that "Now you just pacify yourself. You have done." So he immediately stopped killing.

So Kuvera became very much pleased that although he could kill all the descendants of Kuvera, he stopped it. So he came forward to give him some benediction. So Kuvera is the richest treasurer. So he wanted to give some benediction. If Dhruva Mahārāja wanted, he could ask him that "Give me all the money of the universe." He could give. But what did he ask? He said, "Sir, give me benediction that I may remain attached to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa."

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
It is a great example. He could ask him for money, but no. "Give me benediction. You are offering me benediction, so give me this benediction, that my mind may always remain attached to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa." Come on. So what are the rules and regulation?
