**Prabhupāda:**
There is such proposition that he should exist, he should not exist. Then there must be some authority to give such order. That is answered in //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa says, //mayādhyakṣeṇa// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]: "Under My superintendence, nature is working." //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
He also says that the species are not created independently. They say it is descended from..., one after another.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if there is no question of independence, then how, abruptly, he can begin from a certain species? You must explain wherefrom this species came into existence. //Harer nāma harer nāma...//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There are so many books on Darwin's theory. 'Cause in the library, if one goes, there are hundreds of volumes of books on Darwin's theory.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have accepted or protested?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Mostly they accept, and there are some who are also very critical, what they're..., what he's saying is really correct. But those are very few. Mostly, most books are supporting.

**Karandhara:**
Recently, there was an issue that some people wanted that the theory that God created the earth and the species to be taught in schools along with Darwin's theory.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Karandhara:**
But the..., it was defeated because the scientists said, "If we make such a statement in our schools, everyone will take us as fools."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that? I could not follow. Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The evolution...

**Karandhara:**
A group of, a group of people wanted that in school they should also teach that God created the earth and the people...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Karandhara:**
Not just say that it was created by chance, random biology. But scientists objected, said, "We cannot say that God created the earth, because then everyone will take us as fools." And they defeated the measure. The scientists said, "Everyone knows the earth is just created by biological chemistry. If we say that God created the earth, everyone will think us as fools."

**Prabhupāda:**
The biology, chemistry, why don't you create? The biology and chemistry has advanced so much. Why don't you create? What is their answer?

**Karandhara:**
"In the future."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is their foolishness. Why future? If it is already created, biology and chemistry, and you know the process, why don't you create by chemistry, biology?

**Brahmānanda:**
[about ground] It's very wet.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It is a little wet, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we can...

**Devotee:**
The whole lawn is. It's all wet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I do not wish to come here. There is no facility for walking. Everywhere wet.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Ahh. This is wet also. Let's go this side.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere wet. There is a little space to walk. If biology, chemistry is the origin of life, so the chemistry, biology's so much advanced, why they cannot create life? When the crucial point is touched, they say, "We shall do it in future." Why future? If it is already done at present, why future?

[looking at small piles of earth] What is this?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
This is... Small ones?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
These are some small earth, mound of earth taken out from the inside to make room for oxygen for the plants to breath.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. These are stools.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No, these are not stools, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There's a machine. They go around like this, and that makes a little earth taken out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ahhh.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They say they'll be doing in the future.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is nonsense. Future, that is not science. "Trust no future, however pleasant." This is the word. What is this? Everyone will say "future." "Trust no future, however pleasant." You may think it is very pleasurable. Why future? If you say that the biology, chemistry is the beginning of this life, so you are now so much advanced, why don't you create? Then what is the meaning of your advancement? You're talking nonsense.

**Karandhara:**
They always say they're right on the verge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Karandhara:**
They always say they're right on the verge.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is also the future, in a different way. You have to accept that you do not know still what is the truth. You are expecting in future. That, that is the proof that your knowledge is imperfect. Why future?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Because their present knowledge cannot...

**Prabhupāda:**
It is, it is something like giving post-dated check. I pay you one //lakh// of rupees, post-dated. Although I have no money... What is the value of that check? Will anybody accept that check? "Oh, I have received the money." That is foolishness. Why future? You are talking of future, and you are talking of perfectness at present. What is this nonsense? You are claiming that your science is perfect, and at the same time, when practical example wanted, you say, "I shall do it."

The same example. I am saying I am millions..., I am owner of millions of dollars. And you ask me, "Give me some payment," "Yes, I give you post-dated check," will you accept? At present, if you give me five dollar, I see something tangible. And you're talking of big, big word, but you'll pay me in the future. So is it very sanguine proposal? And I am to accept it? So what kind of intelligent man I am also? You cannot produce even a grass by biological chemistry. You cannot do anything. Still you are claiming, "It is produced of chemistry, biology." What is this nonsense? Nobody questions?

**Karandhara:**
Even it's produced by chemistry, there's laws...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Karandhara:**
There's laws to those chemical reactions. They never consider who makes the laws.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then? What is this? As soon as there is law, it must be considered that somebody made the law.

**Karandhara:**
It's just a thief's mentality.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Karandhara:**
If a thief comes on something valuable, he does not think who owns this. He simply thinks how he'll steal it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is thief's business.

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So they are all thieves.

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So how we, a sane man, can trust a thief? A sane man cannot trust a thief. There are so many things. They could not produce even a grass, even a small plant in the biology, chemistry laboratory, and still they're claiming it is product of biology, chemistry. What is this nonsense? What kind of scientist they are?

**Locana:**
We couldn't even choose when we were born.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Locana:**
We couldn't even choose being born here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Locana:**
So where is the question of control?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is why, in the ultimate analysis, the geologists, mostly when they trace the origin of life, they say everything started from matter. Living matters came out from nonliving matters.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where it is coming now? It came in the past and not in the now, and not at present? Wherefrom an ant is coming from this dust? Is there any proof? Even an ant does not come.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In fact, there are several theories like that, about the origin of life. And they say starting from matter, all the living matters came from nonliving.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Why it is not coming now, rascal? [chuckles] I kick on your face with boots. Why it is not coming now?

**Karandhara:**
If it happened before, it should happen now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
And it is so amazing that people believe it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means the fools.

**Brahmānanda:**
The blind leading the blind.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. All rascals, //mūḍhāḥ.// Our simple formula is: Anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's a rascal, thats all. Never mind what he is. We immediately reject him, a rascal. Our simple formula. And actually they're rascal. They're talking like rascals, childish, the life came from matter. Prove it. That future, what is this? I am very rich man, and as soon as I ask you, "Give me some money," "Oh, yes. I'll give you in future." What is this?

**Devotee:**
Bluff.

**Brahmānanda:**
Sometimes when we ask someone to become a Life Member, they say, "Yes, sometime in future." We become very disappointed.

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall make vigorous propaganda against all this rascalism. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. //Mūḍhāḥ.// Challenge them.

**Brahmānanda:**
Saying "In future," that is a bluff.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bluff. That is a bluff. When that future will come? That they do not know. That is another bluff. And still, they're proud of advancement of knowledge. Still they're talking of future. And what is your advancement?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So long as the future is there, they have a voice to say...

**Prabhupāda:**
Future we cannot trust. "Trust no future, however pleasant." This is our philosophy. Everyone says that. "Trust no future, however pleasant." You may talk that future is very bright, but we don't believe in that. Why future? If you are advanced---immediately.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That's [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
In the past, you say, in the past the life came out of matter. Why you again say in the future? What is this theory? You have already committed that the life began from matter. That is past, "began." Then why you say now again "future"? Then where is the beginning? Eh? Why this contradiction? If life began from matter, that is past. That is in the past. Then why do you say again future? What is the answer? Is it not contradiction?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yeah. That misses the whole point.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is whole, wholesale nonsense. Wholesale nonsense. You are expecting the fact in the future, still you say it began in the past. Just see the contradiction.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

[someone hits golf ball]

**Golfers:**
Fore! Fore!

**Prabhupāda:**
So contradiction means childish. Contradiction is not scientist. Contradiction is childish.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They started from a point where...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They started from a point where there's no background. There's no...

**Prabhupāda:**
No background, that is another thing. And still, they cannot prove it at present. They're expecting to prove it in the future.

**Karandhara:**
They say, "It happened in the past, but we'll do it in the future."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this nonsense?

**Karandhara:**
But who did it in the past?

**Prabhupāda:**
And how..., how he knows that it began in the past, if he cannot prove it in the present?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They assume it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They assume it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Assume, everyone can assume. That is not science. Assuming, then everyone can suggest like something like. You can suggest something, I can suggest something. What is the proof? We can prove that life begins from life. Just like father begets a child. Father is living and the child is living. That we can prove. But where is your proof that the father is a stone and the son is a child? Where is your proof? We say that life begins from life. The original life is Kṛṣṇa. That we can prove. But you say that life begins from matter. Where is this evidence that a child is born out of stone?

**Karandhara:**
There's a miss... They say there's a missing link.

**Prabhupāda:**
This missing link? Then I kick on your face. You're missing this kick. Now learn it. Nonsense. Here is the missing point. Just learn it. Write vigorous articles to kick on the face of these rascals. All of you. You have got so much advanced laboratories, advanced knowledge. You do not... Even you are defying the authority of God, you have become so great. And you cannot prove that life is coming out of matter. That you are leaving aside for future. And I have to believe such a rascal. Do you think it is nice? You are talking all nonsense, and I have to believe you?

**Karandhara:**
They say they have almost proof that some acids... They make some acids and it's almost like an animal. Just about, not quite, but almost.

**Prabhupāda:**
Asses? Asses?

**Karandhara:**
Amino acids.

**Brahmānanda:**
Asses.

**Karandhara:**
They say if they isolate certain amino acids, it's almost like...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They're almost like components of protein.

**Karandhara:**
They're almost like little animals, little cells. Not quite, but almost. So they say that because that matter is almost like a little animal, therefore there must be just one little missing link, one chemical you can add. They're trying to isolate it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That missing link is kicking you. That missing... Here, you say, you take this missing link.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are trying to make babies in a test tube.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In a few years.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that test tube?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In the laboratory, the chemical laboratory, biological laboratory, so they'll take the combinations of the male and the female...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then where is the test tube? It is taken from the living entities.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then where is the test tube? Test tube is a place for combination, as it is combined in the womb. So that is not advancement.

**Karandhara:**
The womb's already doing it very nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nicely. What is your credit?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They want to..., they want to be very proud that they'll be able to do it outside the womb.

**Prabhupāda:**
But that's all right. At least you are not able to do it now. But where is the credit if it is already being done...

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...in the nature's test tube?

**Brahmānanda:**
They're just doing it in a more difficult and expensive way.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
When somebody does like that, people will give him Nobel Prize.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is stated in the //Bhāgavata: śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:19|[SB 2.3.19]]]. A big animal is being praised by dogs and hogs, camel, monkeys. So they're getting Nobel Prize from dogs, hogs, camels. They're not getting Nobel Prize from any sane man. That is stated. //Śva-viḍ. Śva// means dog. //Viḍ-varāha// means the stool-eater, hog. //Śva-viḍ-varāha uṣṭra. Uṣṭra// means camel, and //kharaḥ// means ass.

So they're being praised by these classes of animal. They're not human being. If anyone gives Nobel Prize to such rascals, that means the man, the committee, who is giving the Nobel Prize to him, they are composition of these animals: dogs, hogs, camel and ass. They are not human being, according to //Bhāgavata.// That is explained in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// I think I have explained it.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are not... We don't accept them as human being. We accept them as animals. So one animal is being praised by other animals. That's all. And that is no credit. That means if, at the present moment, if anyone gets Nobel Prize, that means he's fool number one. That is the... Because the other animals are praising. No human being.

**Devotee:**
Yes. Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But that is the ultimate aim for the scientists.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Scientists means they are rascals. They're talking nonsense. And because they are putting the matter in some jugglery of words, other fools are being misled.

**Brahmānanda:**
That Nobel Prize, the Nobel, he's the one who discovered the dynamite, which has caused so much destruction in the world. But he made a big fortune. So all that money, he's now pushing for...

**Prabhupāda:**
Another misfortune.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He created some misfortune, and he spends the money for creating further..., more misfortunes. What can he do more? Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa...

[pause]

**Brahmānanda:**
It says in the //Gītā// that the demoniac, they do acts, horrible acts which are meant to destroy the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. //Ugra-karma. Kṣayāya jagato 'hitāḥ// [[books:bg:16:9|[Bg. 16.9]]]. It is meant for destruction and inauspicity of the world. This is their business.

**Locana:**
If scientists really believed that they were just made out of matter, then there wouldn't be any question of one scientist thinking he's a person better than another person, 'cause there wouldn't be any individuality if they believed everything was just atoms and matter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? [looking at stick] Now here is a matter. Why leaves and twigs are not coming? Formerly it was coming. What is the difference?

**Locana:**
The spirit soul.

**Prabhupāda:**
The same, it has grown green, and vegetation. Now the same wood is there. Why it is not coming now? Let scientists explain this.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That simply shows how ignorant the understanding is.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore we say rascals, simply.

**Karandhara:**
Well, they would say the chemical composition has been changed.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, give the chemicals. You are now advanced in knowing the chemicals. Inject the chemical.

**Brahmānanda:**
Knowledge means that you have to be able to demonstrate it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That... Otherwise what is...

**Brahmānanda:**
Otherwise, it's just...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācaraṇa.// It is called //ācaraṇa. Āpani ācari bhakti karila pracāra// [[books:cc:adi:4:41|[Cc. Ādi 4.41]]].

**Brahmānanda:**
They should be able to demonstrate it in a laboratory.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Science says that: observation and experiment. That is science. You observe how things are going on, and you experiment. Then it is perfect. But you cannot make experiment, you simply observe, that a child also can also observe, and he can speak something nonsense. Just like in our childhood we were observing the gramophone box, that within the box there is some man who's singing. And electric fan, I was thinking, "There must be some ghost." Yes. These kind of suggestion...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The... In the first time when we learn about the difference between the living and the nonliving, this is one of the very popular questions when we start biology: What is the difference between living and the nonliving? So they answer there are several points to differentiate between the two. And they say the living can move and the nonliving cannot grow or cannot move.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
And the living can reproduce like themselves.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The nonliving is not.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. No.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But they never talk about the soul, the nature of the soul, the consciousness existing within the living.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Because there is consciousness, therefore the living being can create. Because I am conscious, I am thinking of marrying, begetting children. Because I am conscious. And because there is no consciousness, therefore this wood cannot think that he'll beget. The original consciousness, in the //Vedas// it is said, //eko bahu syām.//

God says, "I'll become many." So because there is consciousness, therefore He's saying that "I shall become many." Without consciousness, there is no question of by-products.

[pause]

Now they are supplying water to these green trees. Why they do not supply to that wood, and get it green? Huh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
'Cause from experience they know that it is not going to grow.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means nonsense, that there is something else. Because the same tree, now it is growing, watering, but when it will be dead, you pour water... The medicine is the same. Why it is not doing now, and why it was doing formerly? Then what is the thing that is lacking in it?

**Brahmānanda:**
Similarly, if there's a dead body and they just add some chemicals, that doesn't necessarily mean it will come alive again.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Chemicals are already there. If you say that the chemical is the cause of life, that chemicals are there. Because other lifes are coming. How do you say the chemical is wanting?

**Brahmānanda:**
Don't they say that death means chemicals are gone...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No.

**Brahmānanda:**
...breakdown?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The life, the life energy, the heart...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Life energy, what is the cause of that life energy? Chemicals.

**Brahmānanda:**
Chemicals remain.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So that chemical is already there. Life energy is there. Because from the body, thousands of microbes are coming out. They're living entities. So you cannot say that the life energy is lacking there. No, it is already there. How can you say that life energy not there? Otherwise, how other life is coming? Not only one; thousands. So how do you say the life energy's lacking there? What do you think, Karandhara Prabhu?

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
The life energy's already there.

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You cannot say the life energy's not there.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But the life energy for the dead body...

**Prabhupāda:**
For the dead body means that is a particular dead body. It is not the life energy. That is individuality. The life energy---producing chemicals are already there. But that particular individual living entity has left. Just like I live in a room. So I leave this room. You cannot find me. But there are many other living entities there.

There are ants, there are spider, there are so many. So that does not mean because I have left that room, it is lacking the accommodation. The accommodation is there. Other living entities are living there; I have left. I am individual. I have left. Therefore the individual soul is proved.

**Karandhara:**
They do not know how that life energy comes or goes.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Life energy comes or... There is no question of coming and going.

**Karandhara:**
Well, coming into a body and leaving a body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That means that is individual. That individual person is missing. He has left it.

**Karandhara:**
Generally they conclude that it's a electro-chemical energy in the heart, and that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever it may be, that individual person has left. Other things are intact. Otherwise, how the living entities are coming out?

**Karandhara:**
They don't think that if it's simply a chemical, why cannot they just get a chemical that's a person.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. We refute that. The chemicals are already there. Otherwise how living entities are coming out? We don't say that chemical is missing. Because the same theory: conservation of energy. The chemicals, the energy-producing, that is already there. It may be in different form, but the life-producing energy is there. Otherwise how the other living entities are coming out?

**Karandhara:**
In a living..., in a living entity in the living body, there are so many things---personality...

**Prabhupāda:**
They have got personality, all the living entities coming out, the microbes. They have got their personality. If they're moving in this way, you stop, they'll move in this way: "There is some block. Let me go this side." So there is personality.

**Karandhara:**
But in the dead body, there's no personality.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means that individual person has left. That is the proof. That is the proof of individual soul. Just like there are so many plants of the same species. One is dead. That individual plant is dead, but other species are living. It is not extinct. How can you say the species is extinct? How you can say? Darwin's forefather might be extinct, but the monkeys are there. What is the time?

**Brahmānanda:**
Six-thirty.

**Karandhara:**
Six thirty-five.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. We can walk little more.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But in the same living body, Śrīla Prabhupāda, there are innumerable small living entities. Like the cells themselves, they are living also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In my body, there are millions of living entities. In my intestines, there are so many worms. If they..., if they become stronger, then whatever you eat, they eat it; you don't take any benefit out of it. Therefore those who are full with these hookworms, they eat very much, but they do not grow. They become lean and thin. But they are very much hungry, because these living entities are eating, and he's feeling hungry. And he's eating, but he cannot take any benefit out of it. He's lean and thin.

So already there are thousands and millions of living entities in my body. But they are individual, I am individual. I may be proprietor of this garden, but there are many millions of living entities living in this garden. Similarly, I may be proprietor of this body, but many millions of living entities are living in my body. I know that. Otherwise, how hookworms coming out of my intestines? So you cannot say that the chemical is lacking. Chemical is not lacking.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So when you take Kṛṣṇa //prasādam,// the living entities which are within our body, they're also taking //prasādam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You are very benevolent. [laughs] You take Kṛṣṇa //prasādam// for others.

**Brahmānanda:**
Welfare work.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That you can do without taking Kṛṣṇa //prasādam.// Because you have got stool and urine within your body, and there are many germs; they're eating that. You need not make a separate endeavor to feed them.

[pause]

The individual soul is never lost. That is our philosophy. //Dehino 'smin.// He's simply changing different body under different circumstances. That's all. The soul, individual soul, is never lost. Neither he takes birth, neither he dies. He's simply changing the garments. This is perfect theory.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So when they think nicely, there's no reason why they don't accept it.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they are not nice men. They are rascals. They're not even gentlemen. A gentleman will have some shyness, some shame. But they're shameless. They cannot answer properly, still, shamelessly, they claim they're scientist.

**Brahmānanda:**
They're expert bluffers.

**Prabhupāda:**
They're not even gentlemen. At least, I take them like that. They're talking that in the past, from matter, living force came, and when I ask them, "Why don't you produce?" "Oh, that we shall do in the future." Why? You have already experienced in the past, and you cannot do it, and you are leaving the matter for future. So they're shameless. Not even ordinary gentlemen. Shameless, that in talking all this nonsense. That is my charge. What do you think?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. They're...

**Prabhupāda:**
Shameless. Shameless men. We cannot say even gentlemen. A gentleman will be shameful, ashamed to speak something nonsense.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They do not think.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means they are not human being. A human being thinks twice before saying anything. Animals.

**Karandhara:**
And all the innocent, they're all misled.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is..., that is our protest, that "You remain a rascal at home. Why you are misleading others?"

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They're spoiling themselves, but not only that, they want to spoil others also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is their business. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]].

[pause]

Kṛṣṇa so easily simplifies the matter. They'll not accept it. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptir...// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. In two lines, He solves the whole biological problems. In two lines. That is knowledge. Minimum words, maximum solution. That is knowledge. And talking nonsense and no meaning. Books, volumes of books, talking nonsense and there is no meaning. Is that knowledge?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That's ignorance.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ignorance. You see?

**Brahmānanda:**
Like the wolves, they bay, "//Ohhh, ohhh.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
The frogs.

**Brahmānanda:**
The frogs, croaking, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Cacala-caw, cacala-caw, cacala-caw, cacala-caw, cacala-caw...// That's all. They're thinking, "Oh, we're talking very nicely." The result is the snake, they find out here is a [indistinct]. Pop. Finish. So this //cacala-caw// scientist means when death comes, oh, everything's finished. That's all. All their //cacala-caw,// scientific investigation, finished. And he becomes a dog, cat and something like that. That's all. Therefore //mūḍhāḥ.// They do not know that "I have got this valuable life, human form of life, advanced intelligence.

I'll have to take lesson from Kṛṣṇa and make my life successful." They do not know that. //Cacala-caw, cacala-caw, cacala-caw, cacala-caw,// and then die, and become again. When he dies, there is no question of science and talking nonsense. That is under the grip of nature. "Yes, come on. Enter this body. Finished." Just like the rascal rogue. He's very much proud of his strength. And the police comes, arrest: "Come on. Enter this custody. Finished." It is like that.

**Devotee:**
We should go back, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] All these big scientists, they discover so many things. Why they did not discover something that he would not die? He would not become old? Where is that discovery? They will say, "Yes, in future." [chuckles] One man is kicking on your face, and you are saying, "Yes, in future, when I shall become strong, I shall kick you." But you are, my dear sir, being kicked now. What you are doing now? "Yes, I'm getting strength by your kicking." So you all write very strongly, vehemently.

Even it is little offensive, still these rascals should be taught good lesson. Yes. They're misleading. Godlessness. As soon as you say, "God created," immediately they become arrogant. That is our protest. If they accept God, then we give them all credit. That's all right. Otherwise zero. We don't deprecate their intention of advancement in knowledge, but we simply protest against their defying the authority of God. That is our point.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
If they hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// then their hearts will be changed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Certainly. Yesterday, somebody has thanked to our students that "Oh, we are so obliged to you that you are supplying //Bhāgavatam.//" Is it not? Somebody has said?

**Devotees:**
Yes, yes. Tripurāri said that. Tripurāri.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Tripurāri. Yes. Somebody said like that?

**Tripurāri:**
Yes, two boys yesterday at the airport, they bought two sets of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatams.//

**Jayatīrtha:**
Complete?

**Tripurāri:**
Six volumes. They held the //Bhāgavatams// and said, "Thank you very much." And then they put them in their lockers, and they were walking..., waiting for their plane, and they each had the First Canto...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Any sincere man will feel obliged of our this propaganda movement. By distributing these books, you are doing a great service to Kṛṣṇa. He wanted to say everyone: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He comes, therefore. So anyone who is doing the same service, that "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa," he is recognized by Kṛṣṇa very nicely. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā: na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. In the human society, nobody is dearer than him who is helping preaching work. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Brahmānanda:**
We are simply your puppets, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You're giving us the books.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. We are all set of puppets of Kṛṣṇa. I am also puppet. [chuckles] Puppet. This is disciplic succession. We, we have to become puppet. That's all. As I am puppet of my Guru Mahārāja, if you become my puppet, then that is success. Our success is there when we become puppet of the predecessor. //Tāṅdera caraṇa sevi bhakta sane vāsa// [Nāma-saṅkīrtana 7].

To live in the society of devotees and to become puppet of the predecessor //ācārya.// This is success. So we are trying to do that, Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, and serve the predecessor. That's all. //Harer nāma harer nāma...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]].

[pause]

People will come. People will appreciate our propaganda. It will take some time.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are appreciating more now than a couple of years ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They're starting to understand the genuine philosophy.

[pause]

All glories to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, distribute. Distribute...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Like some //prasādam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, you distribute to all.

**Devotees:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
