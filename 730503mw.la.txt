**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So why [indistinct] oh //jaya...//

**Devotee:**
[introducing recording] Prabhupāda's morning walk. May 3rd, 1973, Los Angeles.

**Prabhupāda:**
...is that the whole world is running on a false theory that life is born out of matter. But that is not a fact. So how to defeat this theory? That is our business. We have to defeat this rascal theory. We have to challenge all these rascals and defeat them. How it is possible?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
By logic.

**Prabhupāda:**
By logic, by science. Anyway, that we have to make program. Because this is most misleading. The whole human society is affected by this misleading theory. We have to make program, go from place to place and invite all big men, all scientists. That program we have to make. We cannot allow this nonsense theory to go on. We must make something. [//japa//] Brahmānanda, how to make this?

**Brahmānanda:**
Some program?

**Prabhupāda:**
This is a fact, that..., that life comes from life. In another sense, life does not come; life is existing. It is not exactly the word that life generates. No. Life is existing. The matter is generating. Matter is generating, and it stays for some time, again it is vanished. Just like this body. This body is born at a certain date, and it will be finished at a certain date. This is matter.

[break] The wood was born at a certain date from the tree. It remains green for certain time. Then it is not green---dry. Then, after some time, it will be finished. Matter is not permanent. Matter is changing. //Ṣaḍ-vikāra.// Six kinds of changes, matter. Birth, then growing... Matter grows also. Just like the body has grown. It was very small, pea-like body in the beginning, and it grows. So birth, growth, maintenance for some time, then by-product. There are some by-products. And then dwindling, then finished. This is matter.

But life has no such change. When the life is within the matter, it appears that it is taking birth or death. Life is [indistinct]. One phase of this change, accept. And when it cannot be maintained anymore, just like this body, when it is too old it cannot be maintained. Just like dress: when it is too old, we change. So these things are there. So matter is... Life is existing. Life has no change. The change is outward, material things. In all respects we have to prove that life does not come from matter. Matter generates from life, stays for some time, and it is finished. Again begins another chapter.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The original source is life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Life, yes. They are searching after the original source. That is life, Kṛṣṇa, //sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1], cause of all causes. So this is not theory; this is fact. Now we have to prove it. Then the whole program of these rascals' theory will be changed, and people will be happy. Because they are standing on a wrong theory, all their calculations are wrong, and people are suffering. The rascal Darwin's theory, so many, based on this foolish theory, wrong conception of life.

So we have to challenge, protest, defeat. This will be our work. Our worshiping of Kṛṣṇa, that is our internal affair. The external affair---we need to establish this theory. Otherwise they'll be leading this society..., misleading. They are misleading. Not leading; misleading. So we have to stop this misleading. Make program how to do it. Because it is truth, you will come triumphant. There is no doubt about it. It is truth.

Now you have to know how to present the truth. That is your business. We are not presenting something theories, concocted by my brain. No. This is the fact. Rudimentarily we have got evidences, but it has to be presented by the modern ways. They are presenting some wrong principle by propaganda, and we cannot establish real principle by factual presentation? What is the difficulty?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, when we ask them, they say, "I do not know."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is their position. They do not know. So immediately you have to challenge that rascal, "If you do not know, why you teach? What is the value of your teaching? If your position is 'do not,' then why you stand for teaching fact, or truth?"

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
At the present time there are no people to protest.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we have to protest. Why we are? We have to protest and kick them on their face. That should be our position. If others are not protesting, why we shall sit down?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is why... Others are not protesting. That is why people are accepting about these...

**Prabhupāda:**
So you protest, write in book. You are scientist. Write in book. Prove scientifically. That will be your laurel of taking the doctorate degree. If you also become one of these rascal doctors, then what is the use of your Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that whatever they say you silently accept? No. Just become Babhruvāhana, Manipur Babhruvāhana, that the fighting is faced. Take assistance. You have got.

Ask Dr. Rao to come, join. Make plan. Go from town to town, all over the world. This has to be done. There was a poetry by Rabindranath Tagore. The purport of the poetry, that one who is mischievous, he is culprit, but one who tolerates mischievous activity, he is also culprit. If you are mischievous, you are criminal. But if you tolerate mischievous activities that is also criminal. Challenge these rascals. Stop their rascal theories.

They have been described in the //Bhāgavata// as //śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:19|[SB 2.3.19]]]. //Saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.// The so-called modern leader, he is a //paśu,// animal. And who exalts them? //Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaḥ:// other lower animals like dogs, the hogs, //śva-viḍ-varāha,// camel and ass. So one big animal is being praised by these kinds of animals. So all the population without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they have been described as dogs, hogs, camel and ass. So when they vote for another animal, big animal, so this is their position. They are big animal, praised by the dogs, hogs, camel and ass. They are not praised by any intelligent man.

That is stated in the //Bhāgavata. Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.// They are animals. These animals, they do not know the actual fact, and they are passing on as leaders, professors, scientists. Why they should be allowed? There must be some protest against these men. They have no real knowledge. They say, "I do not know," and still, they are passing as poet, er, scientist laureate. Why this should be allowed? Think over this matter seriously.

You cannot tolerate this misleading. People are innocent. It is our duty to become merciful upon them, to give them real knowledge. And these people are misleading. There must be strong protests against these rascals. You can immediately write one article in some paper that "These rascal has earned," what is called, "prize, Nobel Prize, and he does not know." Immediately write one article. "His position is 'does not know, does not, do not, does not,' and he is getting this prize." So they are also dogs, hogs, asses, and he's a big ass, that's all. I have explained this in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Take help. They are creating also dogs, hogs, in the university?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So why this should be tolerated? Don't be a doctor of chemist like one of them. Be really doctor of chemist. They must accept. This is the basic, I mean, platform of scientific knowledge. //Antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ// [[books:bg:2:18|[Bg. 2.18]]]. That is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā.// What lesson you have taken from //Bhagavad-gītā? Antavanta ime dehā:// "This material body is perishable," //antavantaḥ. Nityasya uktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ:// "But the life within this body, that is //nitya,// eternal."

This whole cosmic manifestation is like that, the big body, gigantic body of Viṣṇu, external energy, display of external energy. Make plan how to meet them, how to defeat them. Catch them on their throat. If they say, "I do not know," then "Why you have become professor? Why do you become professor? Why do you become scientist? If you do not know, you learn from me. You become my disciple. I'll teach you. You learn it scrutinizingly, with all your knowledge. We shall teach you. Why you evade?" Just the other professor, he does not like to come. Other scientist, you told?

**Brahmānanda:**
The German scientist, he didn't want to come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why he avoids?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
He was thinking carefully and decided that he cannot defend what he has in his mind.

**Prabhupāda:**
We are not ordinary, the so-called //svāmīs// and //sādhus.// We are going to give to the world something which they forgot. I told this in London...

**Brahmānanda:**
London airport. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That was published in the papers. They asked me, "Why you have come to London?" And "Because to teach you something which you has forgotten."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Is it before Prabhupāda came here?

**Brahmānanda:**
In London.

**Prabhupāda:**
In London. Here also I told in New York...

**Brahmānanda:**
Come to make us...

**Prabhupāda:**
"To make you intelligent. You are all fools and rascals." Yes, they are fools and rascal, because they do not know what he is. He is thinking, "I am this body." So anyone who is thinking, "I am this body," he is an ass. That is stated in the //Bhāgavata. Sa eva go-kharaḥ// [SB 10.84.13].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is the basis that life started from matter. They are thinking that this is the body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore we have to make very strong propaganda against this theory. Otherwise if you sleep only and take doctorate title, what is the use? You have to fight against these rascals. Make your soldier's party and start fighting against these rascals. No more toleration. No more silence. [buzzing sound] What is that sound?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, it's a power saw. They are going to cut the woods.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [//japa//]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
If we publish that the original source is life, then everybody has to accept it that the... Everybody has to accept Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is our program. As soon as they agree, "Yes, life is...," then they have to accept Kṛṣṇa, automatically. //Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1]. //Harer nāma...//

[break] Some of them are taking that this is a //saṅkīrtana// party. We are //saṅkīrtana// party, undoubtedly. But they may not think, "They are sentimentalist." They must know that we are scientist. [//japa//] Everywhere is the direction. These high waves, this big Pacific Ocean, they are also carrying out the direction of that supreme life.

[pause]

Just like this airplane is floating. Is it floating without any direction?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There is direction.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So everything is working under direction. Why these rascals say like that? The aeroplane is a big machine. It is flying, but under the direction of a small spiritual spark, the driver...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Pilot.

**Prabhupāda:**
Pilot. How you can deny it? So as the small spiritual spark can direct a so-called gigantic plane, similarly, the big spiritual spark is directing this whole cosmic manifestation. What is the difficulty to understand? You cannot say that "Without that spiritual spark, that airplane can be operated." You cannot say. That is not possible. You prove that "Without that spiritual small spark, this big 747 aeroplane will..." You cannot prove that. Where is your proof? You have to put that small spiritual spark. First of all the pilot body. Now, within that body, Kṛṣṇa says, //asmin dehe, dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ, tathā dehāntaram// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. There is //dehinaḥ.// There is a proprietor of this body.

So that proprietor is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair---very, very small, atomic. On account of that atomic spiritual energy, there is working. This is bare fact. That small atomic spiritual energy is within this body, and therefore the body is working, and therefore the plane is working. Where is the difficulty to understand? Now, this man thinks himself very stout and strong, but why he is stout and strong? On account of that small spiritual spark is there. As soon as the small spiritual spark is gone, stout and strong has no meaning. Immediately all the birds will come. Vultures will come and eat him, eat the body. Immediately.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
When the spirit goes out, the other living entities are not afraid of anymore.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Means he is finished. He is finished. That prayer was Kuntī's, that "If you go away, then where is... Everything will be finished. Now they are looking so nice."

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh. Similarly...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
...if the soul leaves the body...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
It looks nice...

**Prabhupāda:**
But as soon as gone, everything is finished. Why these rascals do not know? Why they cannot replace with chemicals to bring a life again? Why these rascals are accepted, I do not know. If the matter is the cause of origin of life... Now one dead man, such a big man, such a Professor Einstein, big brain, he is dying. Put another chemical. Let him come back to life and work again. So why these rascals talk like this?

You cannot protest? You should protest. Your protest will be accepted because our..., they say that "You are not scientist. We cannot talk with you." That's all right. But here is a scientist. Talk with him. Where is your that material chemical by injecting which...? What do they say? What is wanting in the dead body that the body is dead?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That they do not know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then there are so many things they do not know. Still they are scientist? And they are passing on as leaders of the society. Everything is "I do not know," and he is a leader, scientist. What is this? A child, and he is passing on as teacher.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Sometimes the problem is too serious. They take it just lightly.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another foolishness. The same thing, that the rabbits close the eyes. Yes. Monkeys. And when the monkeys face a tiger, immediately he closes his eyes and the tiger immediately attacks. So it is like that. He cannot solve the problem---"All right, let it go on." And that is the position. Because our real problem is death. Nobody wants to die. So the scientist cannot give any relief from death. They are talking simply superficially. They cannot give any relief from death.

But my real problem is death. I do not wish to die. I do not wish to become old man. What scientists can help me? I do not wish to become diseased. What the scientist can help me? I do not wish to take birth. These things, they cannot do anything. Major problem they have set aside. And they are, what is called, jackal.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Jackals?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There is a story of the jackal. He became the king of the forest.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I think I have read this [indistinct] Hindi?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is Sanskrit. And in Bengal it is called //ban āsiyā rāja//[?]: "In the forest, a jackal has become king." They are like that. //Nīla-varṇa-sṛigālavat.//[?] When... There is big story about this jackal. I will tell you something. A jackal came in the village and he fell in the tub where, what is called, that water?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. The washerman keeps the water for dipping, making little bluish.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
For coloring? Some dye?

**Prabhupāda:**
For coloring. That blue, blue. So the washerman kept the dye water in a big tub, and the jackal fell in it. So jackal fell in it; he became blue, all blue. So he fled away, and all the animals said, "What is this animal? What is the animal? What is that animal? Oh." All, even lion became surprised: "We have not seen this animal." So "Who are you, sir?" "I am sent by God to rule over you." "Oh?" So they began to worship him as God, as leader.

Then one day other jackals, they were crying, "//Waa, waa.//" But the jackals cannot stop. If others jackals cry, the jackal cannot stop. So he also began to "//Waa, waa.//" Oh, then they, "Oh, this rascal is a jackal." //Tāvac ca śobhate mūrkho yāvat kiñcin na bhāṣate.// That these rascals are jackals. Now they are talking nonsense. We can detect that "Here is a jackal."

So we have to expose them. They are not leader; they are jackals.

[pause]

Jackals cannot anymore rule over. That should be our propaganda. Not only scientific---all political field, social field, everything. They should be all kicked out. They should be replaced by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then people will be happy. This should be our program. Our this propaganda means to make people happy. It is not a business, to make business and take some money.

[pause]

And so many jackals have been arrested and resigned in your... You know that? Many jackals have been obliged to resign their post in the government.

**Brahmānanda:**
That is Watergate Affair.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Brahmānanda:**
The Watergate Affair.

**Prabhupāda:**
Watergate?

**Brahmānanda:**
It is called the Watergate scandal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, what is that Watergate scandal?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, that was the place where the headquarters of the Democratic party were. Called Watergate. And the big, big important men...

**Prabhupāda:**
They were being bribed.

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, they went to put tape recorder devices...

**Karandhara:**
Bugging.

**Brahmānanda:**
...so they'd know what the opposite party is doing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is that?

**Brahmānanda:**
The Republicans.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Republicans. Who is in power now?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, Nixon. He is Republican.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is Republican.

**Brahmānanda:**
So he was... They haven't traced it to him yet, but all his chief aides, they have all been implicated. It was during the election.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So therefore they are defeated.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yeah. They knew what the Democrats were doing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This position is at the present moment, no honest man can become a government officer, everywhere. Unless he is a rogue, dishonest person, he cannot maintain his governmental position. Therefore no noble man is going to the government. But what he can do?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Politicians are the greatest cheaters.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Scoundrel. Some philosopher said that "Politics is the last place of the scoundrels. That is their last resort." In India we see same thing. //Harer nāma, harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]].

[enters car]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. So design some means how to fight with these...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Jaya, all glories [end]
