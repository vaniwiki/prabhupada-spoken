**Prabhupāda:**
So first of all I shall distribute, then //kīrtana?//

**Karandhara:**
Yes. Will all the new initiates step forward [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
Neck beads fixed up?

[leads word-by-word chanting of //mantra//]

> nama apavitraḥ pavitra vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bahyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ
> [Garuḍa Purāṇa]

**Jagadīśa:**
Julie? Jagariṇī.

**Prabhupāda:**
You know the rules and regulation? Yes.

**Julie:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
So your name is Jagariṇī. Jagariṇī---who is always awake; never sleeps. [laughter] Just see. This life is for //jagaraṇa. Uttiṣṭhata jāgrata.// Everyone is sleeping, dull, like animal. The animals are sleeping. Although they are running very fast, but according to //śāstra,// they are sleeping because they do not know what is life. So anyone who does not know what is the value of life, he is sleeping.

And one who knows what is the value of life, he is //jāgrata.// The Vedic injunction is this, //uttiṣṭhata jāgrata prāpya varān nibodhata// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 1.3.14]: "Now, this time, in human form of life, you become awakened, and the benediction which you have got, utilize it." They do not know. They are just like animals, sleeping. Ignorance. Ignorance is sleeping. Does not know what is the value of life. Come on.

**Bruce:**
No illicit sex, meat-eating, no intoxications and no gambling.

**Prabhupāda:**
Actually or theoretically? [laughter] Thank you. What is his name?

**Jagadīśa:**
Brahma-rūpa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, your name is Brahma-rūpa. The impersonalists, they say Brahman has no //rūpa.// We say, "No, there is //rūpa.// That is Kṛṣṇa." Brahma-rūpa. Brahma-rūpa dāsa.
