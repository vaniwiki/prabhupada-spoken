**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of verse, etc.] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

> kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ
> sarva-kāma-dughā mahī
> siṣicuḥ sma vrajān gāvaḥ
> payasodhasvatīr mudā
> [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]

//kāmam//---everything needed; //vavarṣa//---was showered; //parjanyaḥ//---rains; //sarva//---everything; //kāma//---necessities; //dughā//---producer; //mahī//---the land; //siṣicuḥ sma//---moisten; //vrajān//---pasturing grounds; //gāvaḥ//---the cow; //payasā udhasvatīḥ//---due to swollen milk bags; //mudā//---because of a joyful attitude.

[01:19]

Translation: "During the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, the clouds showered all the water that people needed, and the earth produced all the necessities of man in profusion. Due to its fatty milk bag and cheerful attitude, the cow used to moisten the grazing ground with milk."

**Prabhupāda:**
So due to good king, in... There is a maxim in Bengali: //rājera doṣe rāja naṣṭa, rājya naṣṭa, gṛhiṇī doṣe gṛhastha bhraṣṭa//[?]. This is very important instruction. If the king of the state is an impious man, sinful man, that kingdom will never be happy. //Bhraṣṭa.// Everything is spoiled. As much as in a family, if the housewife is not good---contaminated---then there is no good life in the family. In Western countries especially, and in this country also nowadays, there is no peace between husband and wife, and there is no, practically, no family life. In Western countries there is divorce. Here also the divorce law is introduced. And no family is happy. //Gṛhiṇī doṣe gṛhastha naṣṭa.// So king must be very pious.

So Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira... We have studied a few verses about Mahārāja... So the beginning is //dharmeṇa.// Here it is:

> pitrā cānumato rājā
> vāsudevānumoditaḥ
> cakāra rājyaṁ dharmeṇa
> pitṛ-paitāmahaṁ vibhuḥ
> [[books:sb:1:9:49|[SB 1.9.49]]]

So he was Dharmarāja Yudhiṣṭhira. He was ruling //dharmeṇa. Dharmeṇa// means just according to the desire of the Supreme Lord. This is //dharma. Dharmam. Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. //Dharmeṇa// means, religious principle means to act according to the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is religious principle. It is not that you manufacture some //dharma:// "We are Hindus," "We are Muslims," "We are Christians." These are not //dharmas.// Nobody cares for God. Nobody carries out the order of God. Nobody knows what is God. Nobody knows what is relationship with God. So where is //dharma?// The, all bogus. Therefore //Bhāgavata// says, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. This so-called cheating type of religious system is kicked out in //Bhāgavatam.// Real //dharma.//

What is that real //dharma? Paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi. Namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// This is //dharma. Namo bhagavate vāsu...// Beginning. //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, Vyāsadeva is offering respect. Why? Now, //satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi.// He is the Supreme Truth. What is that Supreme Truth? //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]: that Supreme Truth from whom everything emanates. And this is confirmed in the //Bhāgavatam,// uh, //Bhagavad-gītā: mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. This is confirmed. The //Vedānta-sūtra// gives hint that the Absolute Truth, Brahman, is that which is the original source of all emanations. That is Absolute Truth. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// What is Brahman? Brahman means the original source of everything.

So this is the //Vedānta-sūtra.// And Kṛṣṇa says,

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]

So when one becomes //budha---budha// means well aware of everything---then he understands Kṛṣṇa is the source of everything. He's the Supreme. So... And //dharma,// as it is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in reference with the //Ajāmila-upākhyāna,// that Yamarāja said, //dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. Nobody can manufacture //dharma.//

So here Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja ruled over this planet, Bhārata-varṣa, //dharmeṇa.// Here it is said, //cakāra rājyaṁ dharmeṇa.// Exactly. And here also it is confirmed that //bhīṣmoktam acyutoktam. Niśamya bhīṣmoktam atha acyutoktam.// So if such kind of king is there, then everything is all right. Everything. And establishing such pious king... Here it is stated, //yudhiṣṭhiraṁ prīta-manā babhūva, īśvara..., īśvara, niveśayitvā nija-rājya īśvaro yudhiṣṭhiraṁ prīta-manā babhūva// [[books:sb:1:10:2|[SB 1.10.2]]].

And Kṛṣṇa, why He took part in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra? He wanted that these rascals should be removed, the Duryodhana and company. And Yudhiṣṭhira must be there. Therefore He personally supervised the warfare. He took the reins of Arjuna's chariot to give him direction: "Kill all these demons. Even Bhīṣma. Even Droṇācārya. Kill all of them, because they have taken side of the wrong side. Kill them." That is Kṛṣṇa's order. "Although Bhīṣma is respectful, respectable, Droṇācārya's respectable, your //guru,// your grandfather, and such great personality, certainly they are respectable, but because they have taken side of the wrong side, they must be killed. They must be." This is the instruction.

So //dharma// is so strong. //Dharma// means to abide by the order of Kṛṣṇa. That is //dharma.// If we remain faithful to Kṛṣṇa and what Kṛṣṇa says, if we do that, that is perfect //dharma. Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. That is first-class religious system. We do not decry any system of religion. We do not say that Hindu religion is better than Christian religion. In what way Hindu religion is better than Christian religion? The followers of so-called Christian religion, they're also set of nonsense, and so are the Hindus. Why we should give preference to one class of rascals and fools than the other class of rascals and fools? We have no such idea, "The Hindus are greater than the Muslim or the Christian," or "The Muslims or Christian..." We do not con... We want to see, test how much he's devotee of God, how much he has developed his God consciousness. Then we accept that he is..., here is //dharma.// That is the test. //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]].

I told you sometimes, I think, in New York Airport, so seeing us, the //sādhus,// one young man came to me. So he introduced himself, "Sir, I am Christian. I faithfully discharge my religious principle." So I, I told him, "No, no. You do not faithfully discharge your religion." So he was surprised that without talking with him, immediately I charged that "You don't follow your Christian religion." "No, why do you say like that?" "Do you eat meat?" "Yes, sir." "Then you are not a Christian. You are not a Christian. Because in the Christian religion the first commandment is 'Thou shall not kill.' So you are encouraging killing. How you are a Christian? You are not a Christian." The..., actually everyone is very proud of becoming Christian, Hindu, Muslim, but nobody is following. Nobody's following. All bogus.

Because if they would have followed... We don't say follow this religion, that religion. If actually they would have followed, then the symptom would have been they had become devotee of God, lover of God. And as soon as he becomes lover of God, he becomes fully qualified with all good qualification. //Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. This is the test. He hasn't got to be trained up how to become honest, how to become clean, how to become this, how to become that. If he becomes a lover of God, Kṛṣṇa, then all the good qualities automatically reveal.

Just like when you are out of diseased condition, all your healthy symptoms are revealed, manifest. It doesn't require to bring them separately, to bring them separately. It is already there. Because every living entity is part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa, he has got all the good qualities of Kṛṣṇa, very minute quantity. The Gosvāmīs have analyzed: seventy-eight percent. Not in full, but in minute quantity. It is not joke. Seventy-eight percent of the qualities of Kṛṣṇa is there in living entity. And Kṛṣṇa means all-good; they're all good qualities.

So actually when one becomes a devotee, he is qualitatively one with Kṛṣṇa. Because one cannot become devotee without acquiring the Kṛṣṇa qualities. You cannot go into the fire without being fire. Without being Brahman, you cannot approach Brahman. Just like if you want to be secretary of a very big man, so you must have necessary qualification. Not that any, any man can become secretary of a big man. So when one becomes devotee... It is the statement of //śāstra: yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā... Akiñcanā-bhakti// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. //Akiñcanā-bhakti// means without any motive. That is //akiñcanā-bhakti.// "I'll become devotee because I'll get this opportunity to exploit Kṛṣṇa," that is not devotion. When one shall be ready to be exploited by Kṛṣṇa, then he's a devotee. Not that with a motive that "I shall become a devotee and exploit Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and aggravate my position as sense gratifier." No, that is not devotion.

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

That is //uttamā-bhakti.// And that, when one attains that //uttamā-bhakti,// then he's first-class follower of religion. //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir a...// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. It doesn't matter whether you are Christian or Muhammadan or Hindu; we want to see whether you are lover of God, you are a devotee of God, you can sacrifice everything for God. Then you are religious. Otherwise, I..., there is no question of religion.

So Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja was that type of religious man, //dharmeṇa.// And as soon as you become, then //ajitāśraya:// your shelter becomes under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. It is not story. Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. It is not story. Kṛṣṇa says, confirms: "You just become My devotee, and I'll give you all protection." //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. So many assurances. "Immediately I give you protection." //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mo...// If I am released from all reaction of my sinful activities, then where is my difficulty? Difficulty's there so mo..., so long one is sinful. We suffer the reaction of sinful activities. But if there is no sin, I become purified, then where is suffering? There is no question of suffering.

So the king, being the head, //naradeva...// Therefore king's another name is //naradeva.// He's God. King is considered as God, representative of God. Caitanya Mahāprabhu..., yes, Sanātana Gosvāmī. Sanātana Gosvāmī gave certificate to Nawab Hussain Shah that "You are representative of Kṛṣṇa." When Nawab Hussain Shah was inquiring about Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that "This person is not ordinary person. We are kings. Sometimes when we give in charity, so many men flock round us. But here is a person, wherever He's going, thousands of men are following Him. So He's not ordinary person." After all, he's a king. He has got intelligence. Even from diplomatic point of view, he can understand. So he inquired from his minister, Sanātana Gosvāmī, "So who is this person?"

So Sanātana Gosvāmī replied that "Whom you accept as //pāya-//[indistinct], the prophet is He. It is your fortune that during your reign, He has taken birth in Bengal. You are governor, you are the king of Bengal. And why you are asking me? You are king. You are representative of Kṛṣṇa. You ask your mind and you'll understand what He is." He gave the certificate immediately. Not that "Oh, you are Muhammadan. What you can know?" No. Muhammadan, Hindu, doesn't matter. If one is king, he must be blessed by Kṛṣṇa. He has been given the opportunity to become... And if the king also remembers that "I am representative of God. God has given me this post to rule over this country, to make them dharmic, to follow, to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then that is my duty, first duty," then everything is all right.

The rascal so-called kings, they think that "It is my property. Let me tax the people to the extreme and take the money and enjoy in drinking and enjoying women." Therefore the monarchy's finished. But what is the benefit by finishing this monarchy? The democracy, that is another set of rascal. There was one rascal; now hundreds of rascal. That is the benefit. Hundreds of rascal, they go and form the democratic government, minister. There is dacoitry. There is rising of the rogues and thieves. And they're enjoying fat salary. So at the present moment we are in a very precarious condition so far the government is concerned. People may say that I am speaking against government, but I am just comparing the government of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and the present. If, if... I am not doing anything in my imagination. These are the things. Actually, that is the thing. And if the king is right, if the king is dharmic, proper representative of God, then supply, there is no limit of supply. Take.

We have got experience. In sometimes we find in this mango season profuse mango. People cannot end it by eating. And sometimes there is no mango. Why? The supply is in the hand of Kṛṣṇa through His agent, the material nature, this earth. The earth can produce profusely if people are honest, God conscious. There cannot be any scarcity. Therefore it is said that //kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. God gives. //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān. Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. So God, Kṛṣṇa, fulfills all our desires. Now in Bengal we are seeing some rains. In other parts of India, there is no rain. Last time I had been Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, all dry. People are... In Bombay also, people are very much unhappy. There is famine, declaration of famine. So if there is no //parjanya,// rains, then everything finished. Your so much, so many schemes, ten-years plan, five-years plan and so many plans, they will all dry up. The rascals, they do not know. And how //parjanya// becomes possible? //Yajñād bhavati parjanyo parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.// You perform //yajña,// there will be //parjanya.// The rain-falling is not in your hand. You may be great scientist and calculate so much hydrogen and so much oxygen, mixed up, there is water. Now mix up and bring water where there is no rain.

So these so-called scientist, philoso..., all of them are rascals. We should take instruction from //śāstra.// Kṛṣṇa says, //parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ. Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. If you perform //yajña... Yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ// [[books:bg:3:13|[Bg. 3.13]]]. We have to perform //yajña. Yajña// means to satisfy Viṣṇu. That is //yajña.// Viṣṇu..., the Supreme Lord's another name is Yajña-pati. So //yajñārthe karmaṇaḥ anyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. Therefore everything should be done for //yajñārthe,// for satisfying Viṣṇu. But //na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. These rascals, they do not know that their real interest is to satisfy Viṣṇu, not his sense. These rascals, they do not know it. They think, "Some way or other if I can satisfy my senses, then my life is perfect." But you cannot satisfy your senses without satisfying the Lord's sense. If there is no water, no grain, no food, how you can satisfy your senses, rascal? So if you satisfy the senses of the Lord, then your senses will be satisfied automatically. //Tasmin tuṣṭe jagat tuṣṭa.// But if you neglect to satisfy the senses of the Lord, and if you want to satisfy your senses, that will not be done.

So Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was always prepared to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. He was sorry that so many people were killed in the battle, but he was happy: "Kṛṣṇa wanted. Kṛṣṇa is satisfied, that's all right. That's all right. Never mind so many people have been killed." But personally he was not happy, but Kṛṣṇa was satisfied. Kṛṣṇa wanted. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. So He has finished all the //duṣkṛtām.// But finishing //duṣkṛtām,// everyone got //svarūpa.// They were all liberated. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa is all-good. Either He delivers the devotees and kills the nondevotees, the action, resultant action is the same---both of them become liberated. //Svarūpa.//

That is also stated. Everyone... Because died seeing Kṛṣṇa in presence in the battlefield. Either this party or that party, it doesn't matter. Everyone died seeing Kṛṣṇa, so they were all liberated. It is not an ordinary thing, that in the presence of... We have to remember Kṛṣṇa at the time of death. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind, in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, He's personally present. Anyone is dying, he's seeing Kṛṣṇa. So what is the question of liberation? Everyone is liberated.

So //kāmaṁ parjanyaḥ, kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. Whatever you get, all the necessities of your life will be available if there is sufficient rain. Because after all, the earth produces... This is the system. There is rainfall, proper rainfall, and the earth produces. Not only food grains; also jewels also, produced. Those who are astronomers, they know. Under certain constellation of the star, if the rain falls on the head of a snake, there is jewel. If the rain falls on the head of an elephant, there is jewel. Then in the sea also, the pearls, they are produced. It is all due to rains.

So //kāmaṁ vavarṣa. Kāmaṁ vavarṣa.// We require so many things. Kṛṣṇa is prepared also to supply. Nature is there. But even Kṛṣṇa wants to supply, if you do not become devotee, nature will restrict, "No." That is the proof. When there was less supply... The Mahārāja Pṛthu wanted to kill Pṛthi[vī]. She explained that "Why you are after me? It is my duty. Now there are only demons. I don't want to give food to the demons. I want to give foodstuff to the devotees." She said. So nature's restriction of supply will be there when people become demons, nondevotees. When people become demons, then nature will stop supply. There will be famine, pestilence. This is the way.

So during the time of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira they were not demons. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira..., Mahārāja Parīkṣit... Mahārāja Parīkṣit, when he wanted to kill Kali, he gave him two chance, that "Either you get out of my kingdom, or I shall kill you." So Kali said, "My lord, I am also your subject. My activities are very heinous. That is my nature. I am meant for that purpose. But I am also your subject. So why you want to drive me away? You give me some place where I shall go if you don't like me." Then he gave him place, //yatra pāpaś catur-vidhā, striyaḥ sūnāḥ pāna dyūta yatra pāpaś...// [[books:sb:1:17:38|[SB 1.17.38]]]: "Where there are four principles of sinful activities, namely, illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling, you can go there." So Kali could not find a single place where these things are going on. That is the during the reign of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. So he became very much distressed. Therefore, under his plan, he also wanted to drive away Mahārāja Parīkṣit so that he can advance his activities, Kali's activities.

So one //brāhmaṇa// boy cursed him, influenced. The boy was influenced by Kali. His father repented, "Oh, you rascal boy, what you have done?" One side, that a boy, born of a //brāhmaṇa,// only twelve years old, he could curse even a big king like Mahārāja Parīkṣit, and that is invocable. It cannot be nullified. Of course, Mahārāja Parīkṣit could nullify, but he accepted. So even a //brāhmaṇa// boy could curse. But this was wrong. His father repented later on, "What you have done, childish? Such a king." So as soon as Mahārāja Parīkṣit was moved from the scene, the Kali-yuga began in full force. Therefore sometimes it is said that the //brāhmaṇas// are responsible for introducing Kali-yuga. So that is not actually fact. In due course of time, everything will happen.

So Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was so pious that during his reign time, //kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]], there was regular rainfall, and everything was produced nicely. //Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī. Sarva-kāma.// The, another side is that you don't require industries, trade. You don't require. If you have got land and cow, then everything is complete. This is basic principle of Vedic civilization. Have some land. Have some cows. //Dhānyena dhanavān gavayaḥ dhanavān.// Not industry. There is no need of industry. Because you want some food, nice food, nice milk, nice fruit, that will be produced by nature. You cannot manufacture all these things in the factory.

So therefore the..., at the present moment, the big, big factories, they are the activities of the //asuras, ugra-karma.// All the people are dragged in the city, industrial area, to engage them in the produce of iron bars, big, big iron bars, Tata iron industry, and so many other industry. Capitalists, they have drawn all the innocent people from the village, and they think that "We are getting fat salary." But what is the use of fat salary? One side you get fat salary; another side you have to purchase three rupees a kilo rice---finish your salary. This is going on. Let them produce their own food. Let him have some land. Let him produce his own food. Let there be cows. Let cows become happy.

Now here is very important word, that //payasodhasvatīr mudā, udhasvatīr mudā.// They were very jolly, because they can understand whether they are going to be killed or not. Because they have got..., they're animal, they have got sense. I have seen in your country, almost all cows are crying. Crying. Because in the beginning, all the calves are taken away and slaughtered in their presence. Perhaps you know. So what is the position of the cow? I have seen when we purchase cows, the calves are already taken away. The cow was crying, regular tears were gliding down. So they can understand that... Who cannot understand?

Suppose if you are taken in the concentrative camp, just like the German did. What is the meaning of concentrated...? That he'll be killed after some days. So how you can be happy? If you are already informed, condemned to death, and kept in a concentration camp, will you be happy? Similarly, when these people take these cows to the slaughterhouse, animal stock room, godown, they understand. Very recently, about few years ago, some..., that animal stock store was some way or other broken, and all the cows began to... Perhaps you know. It was published in the... And they were shot down. Shot to death. They were fleeing like anything, that "We shall save ourselves."

So if the cows are not happy, if they are always afraid that "This rascal will kill us at any moment," then how they can be happy? There was no such thing. Therefore it is said, //mudā. Mudā.// Happy. And as soon as the cows are happy, you not only get sufficient milk, but the pasturing ground, I mean to say, ground, becomes moist with milk. So much milk supplied. Here it is stated, //payasā udhasvatīr mudā.// Yes. There is another description: formerly, Kṛṣṇa's cows, when they were passing on, the whole road will be moistened with milk. Milk supply was so sufficient. Simply manufacture butter, milk products, //dahī.// Distribute. Kṛṣṇa was distributing amongst the monkeys even: "Take," the monkey, "come on."

So by Kṛṣṇa's grace if we actually become dharmic, follow Kṛṣṇa, the milk supply will be so profuse that everyone, even the animals, can take the butter and yogurt. That is wanted. That is civilization. Produce sufficient quantity of grains, let the milk..., cows, supply sufficient quantity of milk. All economic question solved. There is no use of industry. No use of man's going fifty miles to work. No. There is no need. Simply land and cows. Here is the statement. //Kāmaṁ parjanyaḥ, vavarṣa parjanyaḥ sarva-kāma-dughā.// Everything you'll get from the land, even luxury articles.

What can be more luxurious article than the jewels? The jewels are also produced. The medicine is produced, the minerals are produced, gold is produced, diamond is produced from the earth. //Sarva-kāma-dughā.// You get everything. Make your civilization very perfect, very luxurious simply by satisfying Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
