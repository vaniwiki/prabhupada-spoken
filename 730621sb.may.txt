**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of verse] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

> nādhayo vyādhayaḥ kleśā

**Prabhupāda:**
Word meaning.

**Pradyumna:**
//na//---never; //ādhayaḥ//---anxieties; //vyādhayaḥ//---diseases; //kleśāḥ//---trouble due to excessive heat and cold; //daiva-bhūta-ātma//---all due to the body, supernatural power and other living beings; //hetavaḥ//---due to the cause of; //ajāta-śatrau//---unto one who has no enemy; //abhavan//---happened; //jantūnām//---of the living beings; //rājñi//---unto the King; //karhicit//---at any time.

[01:58]

Translation: "Due to the King's having no enemy, the living beings were not at any time disturbed by mental agonies, diseases or excessive heat or cold."

**Prabhupāda:**
So in the previous verse it has been described that nature was favorable. The river, the hills, the mountains, forest, vegetable, creepers, these are our natural surroundings. Animals... Everyone was complete. It is a cooperation. So many living entities, according to //karma,// we have got different bodies. Some has got the human form of body, some has got the body of an animal, some has got the body of a tree, creeper. Sometimes hills, mountains also. Everyone. Their business is cooperation. We can study from our own body. There are different parts of the body, but it is a business of cooperation. Hand, legs, eyes, ears, nose, they are all cooperating for the upkeep of the body. Similarly, all living entities---may be in different types of bodies---they are meant for cooperating in the matter of serving the Supreme Lord, central point.

[aside:] Just see the...

So if the government or the chief of the executive power, the king, is just to the point, //dharmeṇa,// as it was said, "Abiding by the religious principles, ruling over the country," then everything, even natural elements, they become cooperative. They must become cooperative. What is nature? Nature is also another energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So the nature is also working under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

> mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ
> sūyate sa-carācaram
> hetunānena kaunteya
> jagad viparivartate
> [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]

So Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's time, the cooperation was so complete that everyone was free from anxiety, disease, calamities, natural disturbance.

In this material nature, or material world, we have got three kinds of sufferings: //tri-tāpa-yantana.// Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī inquired, "Why these three kinds of miseries inflict pains upon me?" //Ke āmi kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya// [[books:cc:madhya:20:102|[Cc. Madhya 20.102]]]. //Tāpa-traya. Tāpa// means painful condition. //Tāpa.// Just like if you touch fire, it creates a painful condition by burning the part, similarly, this world is also a blazing fire, //saṁsāra-dāvānala.// The rascals, they do not know. They are always out of the three kinds of miserable condition. Everyone is in some way or other under these conditions. These conditions means it is...

These //kleśāḥ,// painful conditions, they are created by three causes. What are those causes? //Daiva-bhūtātma-hetavaḥ. Daiva// means created by the demigods. //Daiva, devatā.// Just like this rain department, water department, is under the control of Indra. So Indra can supply water just to your requirement, or sometimes he does not supply, or sometimes he supplies over, over-requirement. //Ativṛṣṭi, anāvṛṣṭi. Anāvṛṣṭi// means no rain, and //ativṛṣṭi// means excessive. So we don't want excessive or less. We want just proper. So this is under the control of the //devatā.// You cannot say... You may be very great scientist, you cannot say that "It is under my control." When there is no rainfall, you cannot say, "All right, we are scientist. We are creating rain." You can theoretically say, "Now we are making progress. In future." All these rascals say, "In future." And we also believe that "In future these rascals will give us all happiness." Not now. Now you die.

Just like a clever lawyer, his client was condemned to death, to be hanged. I have seen it in Allahabad high court. And still, he is patting him, "Don't worry. I shall get you released by appeal. Now you can go to be hanged, and I shall get you released." Like that. I have seen it. One big European barrister... In those days European barristers were very valuable. Mr. Allston. I had also one case in high court. So one man, one medical practitioner, he killed his servant in the operation room very mercilessly. The servant was implicated with his wife. To revenge, he called the servant in the operation room. The servant did not know that he was to be killed. And immediately he was captured, chloroform, and mercilessly killed with knife and then packed up in a box. He was taking the corpse in a different place to throw away. In the meantime, a police officer was passing. He saw that drops of blood is coming out of the box. He immediately arrested. So this case was. Then the doctor was condemned to death. So Mr. Allston was appointed his lawyer. So he was solacing, "Don't worry, I shall get you released by appeal."

So our so-called scientist, they also say like that: "In future we shall do this. In future. Now you go to hell. That's all." But in future they cannot do anything. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. Nature's law is so strong. The so-called childish scientists, they cannot give any relief. That is not possible. That is not possible. It is simply false promise. And those who are fools and rascals, they believe that in future... Future, but what they have done in the past? They cannot do anything.

Therefore it is said, there are three kinds of miserable condition: //daiva, bhūta, ātmā. Daiva// means //adhidaivika,// and //bhūta// means //adhibhautika,// and //ātmā// means //adhyātmika.// Three kinds of miseries. //Adhyātmika:// pertaining to your body and mind. Body, we have got, we have got experience, so many bodily troubles, anxieties. If not body, mental. These are called //adhyātmika.// Then //adhibhautika.// I am peaceful, but another neighbor, or another animal, will give me some trouble. I am peacefully sitting here, but these flies are giving me trouble unnecessarily. I have to take precaution. So there are flies, mosquitoes, at night so many other animals, they come. Besides that, my brother, my friend, they are also prepared to give me trouble. Some way or other, other living entities causing some painful condition. This is called //adhyātmika...,// er, //adhibhautika.// And //adhidaivika. Daivika:// painful condition created by the demigods. Just like there is hurricane all of a sudden. So many trees falls down, sometimes cottages devastated, overflood, excessive rain, overflood, famine, pestilence. You have no control. You cannot control. You can simply say, "In future." That's all. But there is no control.

So we are always in this painful condition. That is material life. But those who have got eyes, sense, they can see. Just like Sanātana Gosvāmī, he could see. He was prime minister, well situated materially. Learned scholar, very intelligent. Otherwise, how they could become Caitanya Mahāprabhu's personal associates? Very qualified. Caitanya Mahāprabhu... When Sanātana Gosvāmī consulted Jagadānanda, that "I want to do this. What is your advice?"... Sanātana Gosvāmī became infected with itches all over the body. And it was, what is called, bleeding itches. Itches are two kinds: dry, and sometimes oozing water. What is called?

**Devotee:**
Pus. Pus.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not pus.

**Devotee:**
Weeping.

**Prabhupāda:**
Weeping. Yes. The technical name is weeping. Dry and weeping. So it was weeping itches. And whenever he would go to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, immediately Caitanya Mahāprabhu embrace him, and the weeping secretion will touch the body of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So he thought that "I am suffering from this disease. Caitanya Mahāprabhu embracing me. I shall kill myself. I shall commit suicide." So he consulted, not for suicide, but leaving the place. So when he was advised, "Yes, you can leave the place," so Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He heard this news that "Jagadānanda has advised Sanātana Gosvāmī to leave the place," He became very angry, that "You have the audacity to advise Sanātana Gosvāmī, nonsense?" He was so respectful to Sanātana Gosvāmī. The same Sanātana Gosvāmī approached Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, asking Him the question, "What I am? Why I am put into these threefold miserable condition of life?"

So this is our position. We may be very great man in the estimation of our friends and countrymen, but everyone is subjected to the miserable condition of life. They cannot make any solution. That is not possible. They have made a solution, big, big learned scholars, just that Mr. Kotovsky said, "Swāmījī, after death, there is no life. Everything is finished." Unless they think like that, then life becomes more horrible, full of anxieties. If they think of that there is another life and there is punishment and reward, according to our //karma,// then their life is very horrible. So just like the animals, poor animal, sometimes facing enemy close the eyes, as if there is no enemy, so they do like that, close the eyes. Children, when there is danger, they close the eyes. They have no other means to escape. So these people, they close the eyes: "There is no life after death." Otherwise they cannot accommodate.

But there is life after death. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.// There is life after death, simply change of body. Now, there are so many bodies, 8,400,000's of bodies. I can become next life a fly, according to my //karma.// Or I can become next life Brahmā. That is also according to //karma.// But there are varieties of life. So the so-called scientist, they do not know what is life after death, how it happens, how it is going on. This is a great science. That you can understand from the Vedic literature, not from your so-called scientific research. That is not possible.

So how these people, during the time of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, were free from all kinds of anxieties and diseases? //Nādhayo vyādhayaḥ kleśāḥ.// If you are in anxiety, then that will create a disease. Our this psychological condition, physiological condition, is working in so subtle way, little shocking, little disturbance will create another disturbance. The Āyurvedic medicine, they treat patient on this principle, how things are disturbed. They have got their calculation: //kapha, pitta, vāyu. Tri-dhātu.// This body is a composition of these three //dhātus. Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13]. //Kuṇape.// This is a bag created by the interaction of the three elements, namely //kapha, pitta, vāyu//---bile, mucus and air.

This is //kavirāja// treatment. They can understand the position of these three elements by feeling the pulse. This is Āyurvedic science. If one //kavirāja// can learn to feel the pulse, he can say everything. He can say when this man will die---today or tomorrow or... Accurately he will say. The pulse beating is so scientifically described in Āyurvedic science, as soon as he fixes up the pulse beating, immediately the formulas are there: "Such kind of pulse beating will create such and such symptoms." So you feel the pulse and inquire the patient, "Are you feeling like this?" If he says, "Yes," then it is confirmed. The disease is confirmed. Then the medicine is there. Very simple thing. Now, in the allopathic treatment, first of all you have to sacrifice one //chaṭāka// of blood, immediately. As soon as you go to the medical man, in your country, he will take so much blood. First of all you have to give your blood. Then fees. Then you have to purchase nonsense medicine. So here also there are nonsense //kavirājas// also. So unless one is expert in feeling the pulse, he is not //kavirāja.// That is the criterion.

**Indian man:**
It will take two years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see.

**Indian man:**
To pass education, takes two years' time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Two years' time. So this is the... This body is made of three //dhātu,// and misadjustment of these three things... If the mucus is increased, the other two decrease. In this way disturbance is created, and that is the cause of disease. //Ādhayo vyādhayaḥ.// So if people remain completely in hygienic principle, as they are prescribed in the //śāstras,// just like rise early in the morning, take bath, evacuate, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra...// If you follow the rules and regulation, then there will be no anxiety, no disease. People become crazy when he is full of anxieties or disease. If he is happy in every respect, then he does not become crazy, he does not become enemy. If everyone is satisfied, then where is the chance of becoming your enemy or my enemy? Everyone is satisfied.

So in Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's time, the government, the government was responsible also to keep people peaceful, without any anxiety. That is government. Without any anxiety. And now the government means full of anxieties. You do not know how to sleep peacefully at night. You have to keep watchmen, just see, enemies are coming or not, with torchlight. You see. This is our position, full of anxieties. Even we cannot sleep at night peacefully. This is government. And here you see, compare the government---no anxiety. No anxiety. Just compare. So what is the use of this rascal government? The rascal government must be there because we are rascals. You cannot complain against the government, because we select. It is the days of democracy. We elect our representative. So why you should, I mean to say, blame the government? You have created the government. You have sent your representative, a rascal, another big rascal. You are rascal, and another big rascal you have voted; so how you can expect good government? You send only big rascals. That's all.

So there cannot be. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// that in the Kali-yuga all the people will be rascals, //śūdras.// Simply by manipulation if one gets vote, he captures the governmental power. //Śūdra.// He's a //śūdra.// He is not a //kṣatriya// like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, trained-up //kṣatriya.// He is a rascal, third-class man, fourth-class man. He gets the vote and we give vote. So how we can be happy? How we can be carefree or anxiety-free or disease-free? It is not possible. Therefore if the people in general they become Kṛṣṇa conscious, they become trained up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they understand the value of life, how to live, then they can send good representative, Kṛṣṇa conscious man. Then the government will be nice.

Without becoming... //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. If people are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, their so-called qualification has no value. //Kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.// There cannot be value. There cannot be any good qualification of a person who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, who is not a devotee. This is our conclusion. We have got some test tubes. We can study man. He may become a very good scholar, very good politician, very big minister, but we test whether he has got any sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If he's not, immediately I understand that "Here is a rascal number one." That's all. We have got test tube, how much he is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If he's not, then he is grouped immediately in four groups: //duṣkṛtina,// means constantly committing sinful activities; //mūḍha,// rascal; //narādhama,// lowest of the mankind; //māyayā apahṛta-jñāna,// although educated with high degrees, his knowledge has been taken away; //āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritaḥ,// and demon.

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

Immediately we classify, "Here is a rascal number one, lowest of the mankind," or "always engaged in sinful activities," or "whatever education he has got, that is useless, because his real knowledge..."

Just like Professor Kotovsky, such a big professor, he says, "There is no life after death." He's a rascal number one. What is the meaning of this education? He does not know that the soul is eternal. And therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// teaches first, //dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam...// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. "First of all understand this: soul is eternal; you are eternal; you do not die after the annihilation." This is the first education. And these rascals, they say there is no life after death. So how much educated they are you can understand. They are all rascals. And you may open big, big colleges, institution, providing some rascal professor, rascal student, and beg the whole life, and sacrifice everything. It is useless. //Śrama eva hi kevalam:// simply wasting time.

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed ratiṁ yadi
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

//Śrama eva hi kevalam.// You can do your duties very nicely, very good, //dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ,// but if you do not develop your, I mean to say, attachment for Kṛṣṇa... //Vāsudeva-kathā ruciḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:16|[SB 1.2.16]]]: "Oh, here //kṛṣṇa-kathā// is going on. Topics on Kṛṣṇa is going on. Let me hear it." Just like here. We are talking of Kṛṣṇa; nobody is coming. Nobody is coming. Only few, selected. //Vāsudeva-kathā ruciḥ.// There is no taste for hearing //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// So such kind of education, advancement of civilization, is //śrama eva hi kevalam,// simply wasting time. And if you waste your time in such foolish activity, then there will be anxiety, there will be disease, there will be enemies, there will be disturbance---everything, one after another, one after another. Natural disturbance, disturbance by other living creatures, disturbance by your body. So this world will become hell. This is the position.

So just compare the present governmental situation and the time... A king is supposed to be responsible for the citizens' peaceful life---no anxiety, no disease. //Ādhayo vyādhayaḥ.// That is king. Just like one //brāhmaṇa// approached Lord Rāmacandra that "In the presence of father the son has died. You are responsible. There must be something wrong in Your kingdom." His son died. That... It is natural that father..., son lives, father dies. This is natural death. "And what is this? The father is living and son is dying?" So king was so much responsible, even the death must be systematic. There should be no anxiety. There should be no disease. There should be no scarcity, no famine, no natural disturbance. This is government. This is government.

Just try to understand the ideal government during Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's time. Not only Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira; all the kings. //Rājarṣayaḥ. Imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. They were all great //ṛṣis,// although they were //kṣatriyas. Brāhmaṇa// and //kṣatriya,// they used to guide the general people. The high caste means who would guide the people nicely. The //brāhmaṇa,// by their Vedic knowledge, perfect knowledge, //paṭhana-pāṭhana yajana-yājana dāna-pratigraha.// By high learning, they would ad... They were not interested for capturing the government. No. They had no time. But there was consulting body. Even Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja time, there was consulting body, all the kings. The //brāhmaṇas// and the //ṛṣis,// they would form a consulting body and give advice to the king: "My dear king, do like this," and they will abide. Just like head. Head. Head gives the instruction to the arms, not the arm gives instruction to the head. Head. Brain. //Mukha-bāhūru-pādebhyaḥ// [SB 11.5.2].

So //brāhmaṇa// means this portion: head, brain. And //kṣatriya// means this portion: arm. And //vaiśya// means this portion: belly. And //śūdra// means this: leg. So no part is unimportant. Every part is important for upkeep of the body. But comparative study, this part is more important. If my head is cut off, then all other parts may remain, it will not act. Similarly, at the present moment there is no //brāhmaṇa.// All //śūdras,// simply legs. If you keep the legs of the body, what is the value of this body? There must be head. Everything must be there. Everything must be there. The head must be there, arms must be there, the abdomen must be there, the legs must be there. Then it is complete body. Similarly, this scientific division, //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]], the division of the human society according to quality, the //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// Kṛṣṇa says, //mayā sṛṣṭam:// "This is My creation for upkeep of the social system."

So there is necessity of the //śūdras// and there is necessity of the //brāhmaṇa.// There is necessity of the //kṣatriya.// Everyone is required to do, to function, in his particular position. Then the society will be //nādhayo vyādhayaḥ kleśāḥ:// no more anxiety and no more disease. Everyone is peaceful, cool-minded, cool-brained. Then chant Hare Kṛṣṇa without any disturbance and go back to home back, to Godhead.

Thank you very much.
