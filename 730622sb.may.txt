**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of verse] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

> uṣitvā hāstinapure
> māsān katipayān hariḥ
> suhṛdāṁ ca viśokāya
> svasuś ca priya-kāmyayā

[break]

//uṣitvā//---staying; //hāstinapure//---in the city of Hastināpura; //māsān//---months; //katipayān//---a few; //hariḥ//---Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa; //suhṛdām//---relatives; //ca//---also; //viśokāya//---for pacifying them; //svasuḥ//---the sister; //ca//---and; //priya-kāmyayā//---for pleasing.

[01:07]

Translation: "Śrī Hari, or Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, resided at Hastināpura for a few months to pacify His relatives and please His own sister, Subhadrā."

**Prabhupāda:**
So read the purport also.

**Pradyumna:**
Purport: "Kṛṣṇa was to start for Dvārakā, His own kingdom, after the Battle of Kurukṣetra and Yudhiṣṭhira's being enthroned, but to oblige the request of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and to show special mercy to Bhīṣmadeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa stopped at Hastināpura, the capital of the Pāṇḍavas. The Lord decided to stay especially to pacify the aggrieved King, as well as to please Subhadrā, sister of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Subhadrā was especially pacified because she lost her only son, Abhimanyu, who was just married. The boy left his wife, Uttarā, mother of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. The Lord is always pleased to satisfy His devotees in any capacity. Only His devotees can play the part of His relatives. The Lord is Absolute."

**Prabhupāda:**
So we are personalist. We believe... Not believe, not the question of believe, but actually the ultimate truth of Absolute is a person. That is the statement of Vyāsadeva.

> vadanti tat tattva-vidas
> tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam
> brahmeti paramātmeti
> bhagavān iti śabdyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]

//Tattva-vit,// those who are in knowledge of the //tattva,// or the Absolute Truth, they know that ultimately the Absolute Truth is manifested as a person like you, like me. Not exactly like you, like me, but so far personality is concerned, individuality is concerned, He is like us. In the Bible it is said, "Man is made after God." Because God is person, therefore we are person. Otherwise, wherefrom our personality comes? God is the origin of everything. Therefore He is the origin of personality, individuality; otherwise, how we are person? How we are individual? Wherefrom we get this personality, individual?

So the foremost feature of the Absolute Truth is a person. And as a person, He has got the same feelings as we have got. As we have got feelings for our relatives, for our brothers, for our sisters, for our friends, for our enemies, the same thing there is also. If you study your personality or your friend's personality, you can get a rough idea of the Supreme Personality, because our personality is dependent on the Supreme Personality. //Mamaivāṁśaḥ.// We are simply fragmental personality, just like the sparks and the fire, or the drop of ocean water and the ocean. The difference is in quantity. A drop of ocean water or a fragmental spark of the fire is of the same quality like the fire or the ocean. But in magnitude it is very, very small. God is //vibhu,// the greatest, and we are the smallest. God is infinite; we are finite, infinitesimal. That is the difference. Otherwise everything is there, as we have got.

Just like the son inherits the quality of the father, similarly... We are supposed to be sons of the Supreme Person. Therefore, in minute quantity we have got all the qualities of God. Not all. Seventy-eight percent. In very minute quantity. That is our perfection. If we revive godly qualities seventy-eight percent, in minute quantity, that is our perfection. That is there, already there. Simply it is covered by this material energy. Otherwise, everything is there. So the feelings of affection, there is also in Kṛṣṇa.

So Kṛṣṇa expands. //Eka bahu syām.// Expands. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. Kṛṣṇa expands His energy, //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa. Rasa,// humor, mellows, to enjoy, He expands Himself. Just like Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī has given us the definition, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

> rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād
> ekātmānāv api deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau purā 
> caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptaṁ...
> [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]

Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, the same Absolute, but Rādhārāṇī is the expansion of the pleasure potency of Kṛṣṇa. We have got potency as Kṛṣṇa has got. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport//]. This is the Vedic injunction. //Parā,// they say. Absolute Truth has many potencies, innumerable, //vividhaiva śrūyate.// One of the potency is the pleasure potency. Just like we want some pleasure. Pleasure is the constitutional position of spirit soul, or the Absolute Truth. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. God and we, being of the same quality, we are by nature always joyful. So our joyfulness is checked when we are in material condition. Therefore there is struggle. We are hankering after, to revive that joyfulness, but this contamination of material energy, //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa,// they are checking, obstacles.

Therefore we have to get free from these obstacles. //Sattva-guṇa...// We have to go above the //sattva-guṇa, śuddha-sattva.// Then again we revive our original position of joyfulness. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. This is the joyfulness: no lamentation, no hankering. We hanker after something which we want, and we lament for something which we lose. Here there are two business: something gaining and something losing. Just like businessmen, they have got two businesses: either to make profit or to lose. At the end of the year they calculate, "Whether we are loser or gainer?" But in the spiritual world there is no such thing as to gain or as to lose. There is nothing... Absolute. That is Absolute.

That idea we haven't got just now. But that is the nature of the spiritual world. There is no question of loss, nor there is any question of gain. Simply //ānanda, ānanda,// pleasure. Pleasure means because there is no loss. //Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. There is //ānanda,// and //ānanda ambudhi. Ambudhi// means the ocean. Here the ocean does not increase. If the ocean increases, then whatever small land we have got, it would have been finished. No. Ocean does not increase. We have seen that Los Angeles on the beach, the big Pacific Ocean, but just about three yards or four yards off from the ocean we are walking. We are confident that "Although the Pacific Ocean is so big, powerful, it cannot come here." Only a few yards off we are walking, confident.

So everyone is working under the direction of the Supreme Lord. Ocean, although very powerful, very big, still, by the order of Kṛṣṇa, it cannot go beyond the limit. It cannot go. So the... Everything. //Yasyājñayā bhramati kāla-cakraḥ. Yac cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ// [Bs. 5.52]. Now, this sun, the sun, unlimited heat, //aśeṣa-tejāḥ,// heat. But it is also limited. It cannot expand so much heat so that we may burn into ashes. The sun can do that. As the big ocean can overpower all your cities and towns in a second, similarly, the sun also can burn the whole universe within a second. It has got so much potency, temperature. But //yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.// No.

The //kāla-cakra...// I think the scientists also say that the sun, from the orbit, if it comes this side one inch or that side one inch, one side coming this side, the whole universe will be frozen, and the other side, whole universe will be burned. I do not know whether here is any scientist, they say. But it cannot go this side or that side. //Sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.// The orbit which is given by Kṛṣṇa, that "You shall travel within this orbit." //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.//

So everything... And what to speak of ourself? We want to become independent. What is the meaning of independence? Even the sun, moon, or the sea, ocean, nobody is independent. And how we can be independent? We are teeny, very small. There is no question of independence. The so-called independence, as we fight for independence, that is //māyā.// There is no question of independence. When I first met my Guru Mahārāja, on the first meeting he said that "You go to preach in the Western country." I was surprised. There was no acquaintance. So "Caitanya Mahāprabhu's message, you are all educated young men, you should go and preach." I replied that "We are dependent nation, Indians. Who will hear us? Nobody will hear us."

So at that time he explained dependence and independence---temporary, it has no meaning. Actually, at that time I could not realize the independence. We were waiting for independence. What independence we have got? Independence means you go for one kilo of rice and stand there for two hours. [laughter] This is our independence. Everything is controlled. You cannot get. And the price... Before Independence the price of rice was two annas, or five rupees, six rupees per //maund,// two annas per kilo. Now it is more than two rupees. Everything. Practically we have increased our dependence, not independence. In the name of independence, we have increased our dependence. So actually there is no independence. But we manufacture so-called independence. Nobody is independent. I thought, "We are so much dependent on the state rules and regulation. America is independent." When I went to America I saw they are so dependent that any young man could be called for military service without any objection. So every... The whole nation is dependent on the whims of the military board. So dependent.

So we are dependent. So long we are under the control of //māyā,// we are dependent. We are depend... Our constitutional position is dependence, servitude. So by false declaration we think that "We are now going to be independent. We shall not serve Kṛṣṇa. We shall become independent. I shall become Kṛṣṇa." As the Māyāvādī thinks that he shall become Kṛṣṇa, "I shall become God," that is another dependence. You cannot be independent. That is not possible. And to remain dependent, that is our happiness. That we do not know. Instead of declaring independence, if we remain dependent, that is our happiness. Just like children, women, //śūdras,// dogs. Their happiness is when they are dependent. Artificially... Now in India also, the women are imitating independence. But I have seen in the Western countries, in your country, the independence, declaration of independence by the woman class, is not their happiness. They are unhappy. Better to become dependent upon father, upon husband and upon elderly children. That is their happiness.

Just like Kuntī. Kuntī, so much qualified lady, she can call any demigod. She got one benediction from Durvāsā Muni. When she was young girl, she served Durvāsā Muni. Mahārāja Kuntibhoja used to invite so many saintly person. That is the system in India still. So once Durvāsā Muni became a guest of Mahārāja Kuntibhoja, and Kuntī served the Durvāsā Muni. He was very pleased, and he gave her one benediction that "You can call any demigod by your sweet will. As soon as you desire, the demigod will come." So Kuntī, she was a girl; she made an experiment, immediately called the Sūrya, the sun-god, and he came. So Sūrya asked him [her] that "You have called me. You take some benediction. Take a son from me." She refused: "No, I am unmarried. I cannot." "No, there is no harm. Your son will be born from the ear." Generally, the son is born from the vagina, but Kuntī's son was born from the ear. Therefore Karṇa. The first son was Karṇa. Unmarried.

Therefore Karṇa was, I mean to say, given away, because she could not show, and when Karṇa was floating on the water, that one carpenter picked up and he raised him. So Karṇa was known as the carpenter's son, //śūdra's// son. Actually, he is Kuntī's son. So when Karṇa was killed, Kuntī began to cry. And Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja inquired, "Mother, why you are crying?" At that time she admitted, "Karṇa was my son." "Oh? Such a secret you did not disclose? We treated Karṇa as our enemy. We could have taken..." So there are so many incidences like that.

So there are so many things in the //Mahābhārata,// in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// You can learn social, political, economical, philosophical, religious---anything. //Veda, veda// means knowledge. So these are Vedic literatures. //Pañcama-veda. Mahābhārata// is //pañcama-veda.// And //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the essence of Vedic knowledge. //Nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam idam// [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]]. //Nigama. Nigama// means Vedic literature. And it is //kalpa-taru. Kalpa-taru// means desire tree. Whatever knowledge you want, you will get it. //Veda// means knowledge. //Vetti veda vida jñāna//[?]. So //Veda// means //jñāna,// knowledge. Any type of knowledge you want, there is in the Vedic literature.

So it is meant, //Veda, jñāna,// knowledge is meant for the human society. It is not meant for the animals. Animals cannot study //Veda.// And what is the purpose of //Veda?// The purpose of //Veda// is to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. This is //Veda.// If you try to understand, or if you understand very little... You cannot understand Kṛṣṇa fully. Kṛṣṇa Himself cannot understand Himself. So it is not possible. But whatever Kṛṣṇa is speaking about Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// if one hundredth part, one percent you can understand, then your life is successful. Vedic knowledge. That is Vedic knowledge. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]].

So all these relatives of Kṛṣṇa, the Pāṇḍavas, His sister Subhadrā---Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma, Subhadrā. Subhadrā was sister of Kṛṣṇa. So Baladeva wanted to hand over the sister to Duryodhana, and Kṛṣṇa wanted to hand over the sister to Arjuna. Two brothers, difference of opinion. But elder brother's order cannot be disregarded. Therefore Kṛṣṇa planned that Arjuna may kidnap His sister. So Subhadrā was kidnapped by Arjuna in the dress of a //sannyāsī.// Don't learn this business, //sannyāsīs.// [laughing] But Kṛṣṇa planned it, that "You come..." Because he was known, if he comes as ordinary Arjuna, then he will be recognized because he is the cousin-brother. Therefore he covered himself as a //sannyāsī,// just like Rāvaṇa. Rāvaṇa also kidnapped Sītādevī as a //sannyāsī.//

So in former days also, the //sannyāsīs// were very expert in kidnapping. Yes. Therefore in the Kali-yuga //sannyāsa// is forbidden, because they'll not be able to follow the rules and regulation. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu inaugurated. He Himself became //sannyāsa.// Therefore we are trying to follow His footstep, to accept //sannyāsa.// But we should not become a //sannyāsī// like Rāvaṇa. No. We should try to follow the footsteps of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He was very strict. No woman could approach Him. They were allowed to offer obeisances from distant place. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very strict about asso... Even in His //gṛhastha// life He was very strict. He would not play any joke with any woman except His wife. And that also, once He joked with His wife, not with any other woman. So He was so strict. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's opinion is that //viṣayiṇām sandarśanaṁ atha yoṣitāṁ ca hā hanta hā hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato 'py asādhu// [[books:cc:madhya:11:8|[Cc. Madhya 11.8]]]. //Viṣayiṇāṁ sandarśanam,// to mix very intimately with the //viṣayīs. Viṣayī// means those who are very much fond of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. They are called //viṣayī.// They have no other business.

So practically, at the present moment, the whole world is //viṣayī.// But this line, Kṛṣṇa consciousness line, is so transcendental that one has to give up this //viṣayī// idea. //Viṣaya chāṛiyā se rase majiyā mukhe bolo hari hari// [//Parama Koruṇa// 2]. We chant "Hari, Hari," but actually, "Hari, Hari," we can chant "Hari, Hari" only when we give up //viṣaya. Viṣaya chāṛiyā se rase majiyā.// Otherwise, "Hari, Hari" is not purely chanted. Therefore there are ten kinds of offenses we have to give up. //Śuddha-nāma.// When we chant pure Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// then we are elevated to the platform of transcendental love. Otherwise, we can attain up to liberation. Not on the platform of loving.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu was very strict about //viṣayī// and //strī-saṅgī.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu was asked how to..., what is the business of a Vaiṣṇava. He summarized in two lines: //asat-saṅga tyāga, ei vaiṣṇava ācāra// [[books:cc:madhya:22:87|[Cc. Madhya 22.87]]]. //Asat-saṅga tyāga:// to give up the association of //asat. Asat// means materialistic. So who is //asat?// Now, //asat eka strī-saṅgī// and //kṛṣṇa-abhakta.// Those who are too much attached for material enjoyment, they are //asat.// And one who is not devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he is also //asat.// So we have to give up the company of these kind of people, who are too much materially attached and is not devotee of Kṛṣṇa. If we can avoid these two persons, then we can be fixed up in devotional service.

So,

> uṣitvā hāstinapure
> māsān katipayān hariḥ
> suhṛdāṁ ca viśokāya
> svasuś ca priya-kāmyayā
> [[books:sb:1:10:7|[SB 1.10.7]]]

//Svasu// means sister, and the relatives. So although Kṛṣṇa is unattached, still He observed the social obligation. There was great fight. All of them lost their relatives. Not only the Kauravas lost everything, but the Pāṇḍavas also. Just like Subhadrā's son Abhimanyu. He was only sixteen years old. His wife, Uttarā, she was once taught by Arjuna. She was disciple, student. Arjuna was teaching her dancing. Virāṭarāja, King Virāṭa's daughter, Uttarā. So they were in disguise. //Ajñāta-vāsa.// So the Virāṭarāja did not know that Arjuna was living in his house. So this daughter of Virāṭa, Uttarā, when Arjuna was known that he is Arjuna, he requested that "You marry my daughter." So Arjuna said, "No, how can I marry? She is my disciple. She is my student. She is just like my daughter. How can I marry?" Then he promised that "I shall get her married with my son, although he is not very grown up."

So Abhimanyu was Kṛṣṇa's [Arjuna's] son from the womb of Subhadrā. So he was married. Only sixteen years. Almost of the same age. Fortunately, Uttarā became pregnant. So Abhimanyu went to fight in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and never returned. So Parīkṣit Mahārāja was posthumous child. He took his birth after the death of his father. He did not see. Not only father; many. Because it was after the battle. He was the only survivor of the whole Kuru dynasty.

So he was also attempted to be killed by Aśvatthāmā by //brahmāstra.// Kṛṣṇa saved. So Parīkṣit Mahārāja was born after the death of his father. The grandfathers took care of him, and as soon as the child was grown up, all the grandfathers, Pāṇḍavas, entrusted the kingdom to Parīkṣit Mahārāja, and they left home.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
