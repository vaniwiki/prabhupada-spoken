[leads chanting of verse] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

//atra//---here; //śūrāḥ//---heroes; //maheṣvāsāḥ//---mighty bowmen; //bhīma-arjuna//---Bhīma and Arjuna; //samāḥ//---equal; //yudhi//---in the fight; //yuyudhānaḥ//---Yuyudhāna; //virāṭaḥ//---Virāṭa; //ca//---also; //drupadaḥ//---Drupada; //ca//---also; //mahārathaḥ//---great fighter.

[01:39]

Translation: "Here in this army there are many heroic bowmen equal in fighting to Bhīma and Arjuna; there are also great fighters like Yuyudhāna, Virāṭa and Drupada."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. So all these heroes are mentioned not only in this verse, in several other verses also. So people may ask that "By mentioning these great fighter, what spiritual progress we make? Because we are meant for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// so by chanting the names of these great fighters, what do we gain?" The question may be raised there. But the thing is that //nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe:// whenever there is connection with Kṛṣṇa, that also becomes Kṛṣṇa.

This is a subtle form of philosophical understanding. //Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.// If there is relationship with Kṛṣṇa... Therefore the //sahajiyās,// they do not read //Bhagavad-gītā.// They say, "We have nothing to do with //Bhagavad-gītā.//" They jump over to the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Tenth Canto, Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā,// as if Kṛṣṇa is connected with //rāsa-līlā// and not with this //līlā.// They make distinction. Kṛṣṇa's this fighting //līlā,// pastimes, and the //rāsa-līlā// pastime, they are all the same, because Kṛṣṇa is the center. Kṛṣṇa being center, whatever in connection with Kṛṣṇa is there, that becomes also Kṛṣṇa. This is the idea.

> anāsaktasya viṣayān
> yathārham upayuñjataḥ
> nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe
> yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate
> [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.255]

This is the instruction of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.//

So just like we, in propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we have to deal with money or persons who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, outsider. We have to deal with them. But when we go to outsider or when we deal with money, there is relationship with Kṛṣṇa, //kṛṣṇa-sambandha.// So Rūpa Gosvāmī has distinguished the...

> prāpañcikatayā buddhyā
> hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ
> mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo
> phalgu vairāgyaṁ kathyate
> [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.256]

//Prāpañcika// means material. So //prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.// Everything has got connection with Kṛṣṇa because ultimately everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy.

The material world is also manifestation of Kṛṣṇa's energy. //Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]], you'll find. Material world means these five elements, gross and subtle. Earth, water, air, fire, sky, these are gross. And mind, intelligence and ego, these are subtle. These elements, material elements, Kṛṣṇa says, //bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā:// "These material elements, they are separated, but they are My energy. They are My energy." The same example: Just like cloud. Cloud is created by the sun. It is sun's energy which creates the cloud. You know. By temperature the seawater is evaporated, forms into gas. That is cloud. So cloud is created by the energy of the sun, but when there is cloud you cannot see the sun; sun is covered. Similarly, material energy is Kṛṣṇa's energy. But when you become covered by this material energy, you do not see Kṛṣṇa. This is the position.

So we have to use our intelligence. That is described by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī: //prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ, mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgaḥ. Mumukṣu,// especially the Māyāvādīs, who are after liberation, to merge into the existence of the Supreme, //mumukṣu, mokṣa,// they, Māyāvāda, they say, "Everything is //māyā.//" //Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā:// "This world is false; only Brahman is reality." But we say that why the //jagat,// the world, should be false if it is coming from the reality? We do not agree with them. We do not accept that this world is false. No.

We can say, "It is temporary manifestation." But it is not false. Why it is false? We are living in this house. If somebody, some rascal, says, "It is false," why false? We are utilizing this house. We are utilizing this microphone. We are utilizing the Dictaphone. Why it is false? There is //sambandha.// There is relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Anything material, made of earth, water, fire, air, they are Kṛṣṇa's energies. Therefore there is direct relationship with Kṛṣṇa. And if Kṛṣṇa is reality, why His energy should be false? No. We must know how to utilize it.

So similarly, in this battlefield, Kṛṣṇa is there, and all the living entities... Some of them are soldiers, some of them are commander-in-chief, some of them this, that--- or the chariot or the ground---everything Kṛṣṇa's energy. So if we remember that everything is manifestation of Kṛṣṇa's energy, there is no question of materialism. It is all spiritual energy. So //nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.// So we have to use them for Kṛṣṇa.

Here all of of them have gathered. This is another Kṛṣṇa's energy. Kṛṣṇa appears, //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. He wanted to kill all the demons. That is another side of His business. As one side, //paritrāṇāya sādhūnām,// to give protection to the devotees, the other side is to vanquish all the demons. Just like if you want to grow paddy on the field, so first of all you have to destroy all the unwanted weeds. Then you grow the seeds, it will come out nicely.

So these two things are required: destruction and construction. Both the things are Kṛṣṇa's activities or different energies. So you cannot accept one thing, giving up the other side. We have to understand that both sides, they are working as different manifestation of Kṛṣṇa's energy. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya// 13.65, //purport//]. In the //Vedas// it is said that the Absolute has got multi-energies. So one energy is working in one way, another energy is working another way. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate, svā-bhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.// Just like here also, when we do something, we require varieties of energies to make that thing perfect. So everything Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's, this material world or spiritual world, everything is working in order, under different energies.

So these, I mean to say, warriors' name mentioning, we should not neglect. Kṛṣṇa wanted to gather all the demonic power in that Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and kill them. That was His plan. So there is a plan of Kṛṣṇa. //Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.// We should not be attached to things as there, but we should try to understand that there is relationship with Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as there is relationship with Kṛṣṇa, we shall properly utilize it. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As soon as we understand that there is relationship with Kṛṣṇa, //nirbandhe kṛṣṇa-sambandhe...//

Everything can be utilized for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is not a stereotyped, stagnant block. Kṛṣṇa is a dynamic force. Therefore everything can be dovetailed in the service of Kṛṣṇa. Simply one should learn the art under proper guidance how to utilize. Then that will be perfect form of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

[aside:] Read next verse.

**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of verse]

> dhṛṣṭaketuś cekitānaḥ
> kāśirājaś ca vīryavān
> purujit kuntibhojaś ca
> śaibyaś ca nara-puṅgavaḥ
> [[books:bg:1:5|[Bg. 1.5]]]

[break] [leads chanting of synonyms]

Translation: "There are also great, heroic, powerful fighters like Dhṛṣṭaketu, Cekitāna, Kāśirāja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Śaibya."

**Prabhupāda:**
Practically in the Battle of Kurukṣetra great personalities, warriors, from all parts of the world they came and joined. Some of them joined with this party and others joined with the other party. So far we have studied... Just like Śaibya, he belonged to Śibya. So all these personalities, we did not get their full description, it would enhance the pages. But these big personalities, we have got their information. There is a book, //The Personalities of Mahābhārata. Bhagavad-gītā// is part of //Mahābhārata. Mahābhārata// means greater India. //Mahā// means greater, and //bhārata// means India.

So this whole planet was Bhārata-varṣa. There was only one flag. The whole planet was being ruled by one king. That is the king of this Hastināpura. The fight is that who would be the king, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira or Duryodhana. But a king... It is not a democraty; it is monarchy. So Kṛṣṇa is deciding, "No, Duryodhana is unfit. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira is fit." This is Kṛṣṇa's desire. Therefore this fight is there. Kurukṣetra, Kṛṣṇa wanted to wipe out all unwanted demons from the face of the world and enthrone Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, because he is the exact representative of Kṛṣṇa.

So monarchy or dictatorship is welcome. Now the Communist, they want dictatorship. That is welcome, provided that particular dictator is trained like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. Not that simply by votes of some rascal population one becomes dictatorship, another rascal comes, another big rascal comes. Just like in the Communist country the Stalin was their dictator, and in the historical record it is said that he is the greatest criminal in the history of the world. Greatest criminal. He would not tolerate anyone going against him. As soon as he finds that "This man is going against me," immediately call him, "Now here is poison and here is resignation." Or kill him. "You take poison or I shall kill you." This was his policy. In this way he killed so many enemies. He not only killed the czar family. So his business was killing. Not that kind of dictatorship wanted. Dictatorship wanted that by his direction the citizens will be so happy that even they will not have any anxiety. //Adhayo vyadhayaḥ.//

We have read the other day in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// there are three kinds of miserable condition of life, //bhūtātma-hetavaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:6|[SB 1.10.6]]]. The cause... They are caused by three principles: //adhyātmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika. Daiva-bhūtātma-hetavaḥ.// These are all described in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Daiva// means controlled by the higher demigods. Just like famine or earthquake, this is not under your control. At any time the earthquake there may be. There may be famine. There may be pestilence. There may be natural disturbance, flood. This is called //daiva,// controlled by higher demigods. Just like Indra wanted to overflood Vṛndāvana, being angry upon the residents of the... Kṛṣṇa saved, Giridhārī. He became Giridhārī.

So these disturbances are there, //adhyātmika, adhibhautika.// But the king or the dictator should be so perfect, and he will guide the citizen in such a way that they will not feel all these disturbances. That kind of dictatorship wanted. He will direct in such a way that even this natural //adhyātmika, adhibhautika... Adhibhautika// means "You are envious of me, I am envious of you." So there is always Cold War, struggle. This should be stopped. There should not be unnatural heat or unnatural cold, excessive heat. People will feel in all respect happy.

If that condition can be brought in, like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira or his forefathers, or even his grandson... After Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, there was no kingdom of Mahārāja Yud..., of the son of Yudhiṣṭhira or Arjuna. All died in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra. Only one grandson was in the womb of his mother, posthumous child. He was saved only. So up to that point, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the whole planet was very nicely governed by dictatorship. So we can bring in such dictatorship, provided that dictator is perfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious. Under his guidance, everything... Because he knows how to conduct kingdom, how to make everyone happy. //Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.//

So here is another list of fighters. But the real purpose of this battlefield is to bring all the fighters, big fighters of the world, together. And under Kṛṣṇa's guidance they would be all killed. //Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin// [[books:bg:11:33|[Bg. 11.33]]]. When Arjuna was declining to fight, Kṛṣṇa ultimately said, "My dear Arjuna, you fight or not fight, it doesn't matter. These people are not going back home. It is already settled up. You simply become..., take the credit that you have fought and killed. It is al... They are already killed, because that is My plan." //Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin.// They are already killed.

So this battlefield, because Kṛṣṇa wanted to kill them, and the result was---you will find in the //Bhagavad-gītā//---they all attained //svarūpa.// Anyone who was killed, who died in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, in the presence of Kṛṣṇa, they all attained their original, constitutional position, spiritual form. They all went back to home, back to Godhead, everyone. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is Absolute. Either His killing or His protecting, it is all the same. You don't think that Kṛṣṇa is killing. No. If anyone is killed by Kṛṣṇa, he immediately gets liberation: the liberation for which great, great saintly persons, sages, they undergo severe austerities for life after life, simply by being killed, he gets that.

So by becoming Kṛṣṇa's enemy, one gets this benefit, just think over if you become Kṛṣṇa's friend, what is the benefit. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Māyāvādīs, they are after liberation. So this liberation is granted even to the enemies of Kṛṣṇa. They are also enemies. The Māyāvādīs, they are also enemies. //Kṛṣṇe aparādhī.// They are offender to Kṛṣṇa because they do not accept the form of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are offender.

So everything studied in relationship with Kṛṣṇa, that is perfect knowledge, and that is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So it is not that like //sahajiyās// that we are interested with Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa// dance, not with this fighting in the battlefields of Kurukṣetra. This is //sahajiyā-bhāva.// This is not wanted.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
