[break] [leads chanting of synonyms to Bg 1.10]

//aparyāptam//---immeasurable; //tat//---that; //asmākam//---of ours; //balam//---strength; //bhīṣma//---by Grandfather Bhīṣma; //abhirakṣitam//---perfectly protected; //paryāptam//---limited; //tu//---but; //idam//---all these; //eteṣām//---of the Pāṇḍavas; //balam//---strength; //bhīma//---by Bhīma; //abhirakṣitam//---carefully protected.

[02:51]

Translation: "Our strength is immeasurable, and we are perfectly protected by Grandfather Bhīṣma, whereas the strength of the Pāṇḍavas, carefully protected by Bhīma, is limited."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm. So Duryodhana is very proud of his strength, military strength. Because he was empowered, he could gather. And over and above that, Bhīṣma is the commander-in-chief. He is giving protection. And on the other side, the Pāṇḍavas, they are not empowered. Somehow or other, they gathered some soldiers from relatives. Therefore their strength was limited in consideration of the other party. And that is, being protected by Bhīma. Duryodhana always considered Bhīma as a fool. Therefore he is very much confident that "Our side is being protected by Bhīṣma, and the other side, although Bhīma is very strong, but he has no brain very much." So he was very hopeful of victory.

But in the previous verse he says, //anye ca bahavaḥ śūrā mad-arthe tyakta-jīvitāḥ. Tyakta-jīvitāḥ// means "They have come to lay down their life for me." This is a foretelling, because actually, whoever joined the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, none of them returned. //Tyakta-jīvitāḥ.// So it is already concluded that although Duryodhana is very much proud of his military strength, protected by Bhīṣma, still, //tyakta-jīvitāḥ,// they would surely die.

This is the conclusion. //Nānā-śastra-praharaṇāḥ sarve yuddha-viśāradāḥ.// No..., not a single person inexperienced was there. //Yuddha-viśāradāḥ. Viśārada// means very expert fighting. Still, they would have to lay down their life, because it is Kṛṣṇa's plan that all these fighting men, they were not ruling properly according to the tenets of Vedic injunctions. Therefore they were demons. Military strength for self-aggrandizement is demonic. Military strength is required to rule over the kingdom, but not to misuse them for aggression to others' country or others' kingdom. That was not allowed.

So when Kṛṣṇa appeared, there were many kings. Although they were under the ruling of the Pāṇḍavas, still, Hastināpura, still they were fighting. That is natural. If one has no Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then his strength and opulence would be misused. And if one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he would use his strength and opulence very properly. So these kings were meant for giving protection to the citizen, to train them to the Vedic conception of life. But they were not doing that. Therefore they were demons.

Although they were //kṣatriyas,// still... //Kṣatriyas// are meant for representing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Actually, Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor. //Sarva-loka-maheśvaram. Sarva-loka-maheśvaram, suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. So He is the proprietor. //Sarva-loka. Sarva-loka// means all the planets, all the universes. Because they are created by Kṛṣṇa, by Kṛṣṇa's bodily effulgence, //brahma-jyotir.// So they are created by Kṛṣṇa's... Just like from the sunshine these planets are created, similarly from //brahma-jyotir,// innumerable universes are created.

> yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-
> koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam
> tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.40]

So it is all creation of Kṛṣṇa. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. Everything has come out from Kṛṣṇa's body, external, therefore He is the proprietor. If I have created something, then I am the proprietor. It is very easy to understand. In the //Vedas// also it is said, //eko nārāyaṇa āsīt:// "Before the creation only there was Nārāyaṇa." In the //catuḥ-śloki Bhāgavata// also it is said, //aham evāsam evāgre// ([[books:sb:2:9:33|SB 2.9.33]]/[[books:sb:2:9:34|34]]/[[books:sb:2:9:35|35]]/[[books:sb:2:9:36|36]]).

So before creation there was Kṛṣṇa. When we speak of Kṛṣṇa, it does not mean Kṛṣṇa was alone. Kṛṣṇa means with His form, with His pastime, with His paraphernalia, with His entourage, everything. When we speak of king, it does not mean king is alone. As soon as we speak of king, we must understand the king, king's kingdom, king's secretaries, king's ministers, king's queen, king's palace, so many things.

Similarly, when the //Vedas// says that //eko nārāyaṇa āsīt,// "Before creation there was only Nārāyaṇa," so Nārāyaṇa with His paraphernalia, with His expansion. Nārāyaṇa has expansion in the spiritual world, //vaikuṇṭha jagat,// innumerable Vaikuṇṭha planets. You have seen the picture. Innumerable. We have given only twenty-four names, but there are innumerable.

So actually, either in this material world or in the spiritual world, all planets, Vaikuṇṭha planets or //kuṇṭha// planets... Here in this material world, //kuṇṭha// planets. //Kuṇṭha// means anxiety. Here, in any planet you go, the anxiety will be there. This is material. //Sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]. Why anxiety? Because we have accepted something //asat,// which will not stay. But we are eternal. We want to stay. Our natural position is eternity, so we don't want this temporary body. Therefore we try to save the body as much as possible. But it will not be saved, because we have accepted something nonsense, which is not compatible with our existence.

The modern civilization, they do not know it. They think it that death is natural sequence; it cannot be avoided. No. It can be avoided. It can be avoided. But these rascals, they do not know how to avoid it, although it is mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā// how you can avoid death. Birth, death, old age and disease, these are the problems. But they do not know how to solve these problems. They are simply engaged in some temporary business.

And they are fighting, they are making plans, they are making diplomacy. But in the real problem they do not touch, neither they know how to solve it. But this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement can solve it. These rascal may understand this fact, that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not a sentiment, so-called religious movement. It is a scientific movement to solve all the problems of life. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. //Punar janma naiti.// If you can avoid next birth... Next birth means to accept another material body. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. After giving up this body, we have to accept another body. These rascals, they do not understand it. So many defects in the modern civilization, full of ignorance, and still, they are passing as great scientist, great philosopher, great politicians. Real knowledge they haven't got. So try to give them real knowledge. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.// This is the crucial point, //dehāntara-prāptiḥ.// One has to accept another body.

So if you can find out a means so that you do not accept another body, then you are safe. Because as soon as you accept another body, //janma,// birth, then where there is //janma,// there is //mṛtyu,// death, also. And between //janma// and //mṛtyu,// birth and death, there is disease and old age. So Kṛṣṇa says that //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]: "One can avoid accepting another material body." How? //Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ.// Simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa, what is Kṛṣṇa, why Kṛṣṇa appears, why Kṛṣṇa takes part in politics, why Kṛṣṇa..., so many, Kṛṣṇa's activities.

So this is... Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means: try to understand Kṛṣṇa. Simply if you try to understand... You cannot understand Kṛṣṇa fully. That is not possible. Kṛṣṇa is unlimited. But to our limited knowledge, whatever is possible, that is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// As far as we can understand about Kṛṣṇa, if we simply understand Kṛṣṇa, His transcendental nature, His transcendental activities, //divyam... Janma karma me divyam// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. //Divyam// means transcendental. It is not ordinary. //Tattvataḥ,// in truth, in fact. Then you become free from this //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. Very easy thing.

Therefore try to understand Kṛṣṇa. How you will understand Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is so great. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. You cannot understand Kṛṣṇa by these blunt material senses. That is not possible. You have to purify it. You have to purify it. //Tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. Simply by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, all your senses will be purified. This is the process. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau.// And you can begin service with your tongue.

Now, this is also very surprising. By utilizing our tongue, we can become perfect. This is also unknown to the modern science. So utilizing the tongue, one can become perfect. Yes. This is the process. If by the tongue you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// and by the tongue you taste //prasādam,// you will be perfect, simply by executing these two things. Do not accept anything, do not allow the tongue to touch anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa. This is one item. And another item---engage the tongue always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. You become perfect. Is it very difficult task? Anyone can do. Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// anyone can chant. And nice //prasādam,// anyone can take. And actually, it is happening so. How these European, American boys and girls, they are advancing, they are realizing? Simply by that process, tongue: chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, take //prasādam.//

So you can introduce this process all over the world. Give them chance to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// But it is difficult also. There was a cartoon? That one...?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Hayagrīva?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that one old lady is requesting her husband, "Chant, chant, chant," and the husband is replying, "Can't, can't, can't." [laughter]. There was a cartoon. So we are requesting everyone, "Please chant," and they are replying, "Can't." Still, they will not chant. This is the difficulty. Otherwise, we can deliver all the people on this earth back to home, back to Godhead, simply by this process: chant and take //prasādam.// This should be...

Just like the other day we held the festival, Ratha-yātrā. Chant and take //prasādam.// That's all. Organize this all over the world. They will be saved. They will understand Kṛṣṇa. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam...// [Brs. 1.2.234]. Kṛṣṇa will appear. Kṛṣṇa... You cannot see Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. You cannot order Kṛṣṇa, "Please come, I will see You." No. When He is pleased with your service, He will come: "Yes, I am here. See Me." That is the history. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. Dhruva Mahārāja was meditating, and within six months he saw Kṛṣṇa face to face. So everyone can see.

Everyone will be able, provided we utilize the tongue. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau. Jihvādau. Jihvādau// means "beginning with the tongue." We have got senses, all senses---eyes, ears, touch---so many senses. But begin with the sense, tongue. Try to control the tongue and engage in Kṛṣṇa's service.

Therefore Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, //śarīra abidyā-jāl, joḍendriya tāhe kāl// [//Prasāda-sevāya// 1]: "This body is material body, and the senses are our greatest enemies," //joḍendriya tāhe kāl.// "So out of all the senses," //tā'ra madhye jihwā ati lobhamoy sudurmati,// "of all the senses, the tongue is formidable." It is //sudurmati,// it has no limit to taste. I have seen in Japan, twenty miles away they are coming to taste some fried birds in the hotel. You see. They have got bus. The hotel has got their own bus, and they bring customers from the city and they are coming after office hours just to taste some jungle birds, fried. There is a hotel.

**Devotee:**
Wild duck.

**Prabhupāda:**
Maybe. Whatever it may be. You have tasted? [laughter] So the tongue is so formidable enemy, simply for tasting, they will commit so many sinful activities. They will commit so many abominable actions simply for tongue. And that is a straight line: tongue, then belly, then genital. So if you can control the tongue, the other things will be controlled. Therefore, //tā'ra madhye jihwā ati lobhamoy sudurmati. Lobhamoy:// it is very greedy. And //sudurmati:// it is very difficult to control.

Just see. Simply for tongue, so many slaughterhouses are being maintained. I have seen. Those who are meat-eaters... I have seen in the airplane, a small piece of meat they are eating; not very much. But for these small pieces, so many population, huge quantity of slaughterhouse is being maintained. They cannot give up that small piece of meat. What is the difficulty? They can make... The same thing can be made by milk, milk product, //chānā.// What do you call curd?

**Devotee:**
Cheese.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cheese. You prepare cheese and fry it. You'll get the same taste. But let the animal live, take its milk, and prepare so many milk preparation. But these rascals will not do. You kill simply for this tongue. It is so strong, this tongue. They cannot give up this, I mean to say, formidable tongue. He is demanding, "You must give me meat." So they are obliged. And for this obligation, they are committing so much sinful activities, abominable activities, and becoming bound up by the laws of nature to accept a body within the 8,400,000 species of life, and becoming the worm in the stool.

They do not know how the material law is working. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. //Prakṛti,// nature, is so strong. It is acting very nicely. So we have to become very careful. That carefulness you cannot do any other way, especially in this age. Simply if you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, Kṛṣṇa will take care of you, and you will be saved.

Thank you very much. [end]
