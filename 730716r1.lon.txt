**Prabhupāda:**
Make-show. So we should not increase the show very, very much. Show, shortcut show. That's all. Real business is... //Āula, bāula, kartābhajā, neḍā, daraveśa, sāṅi sahajiyā, sakhībhekī, smārta, jāta-gosāñi,// they have been condemned by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, //smārta// and //jāta-gosāñi. Smārta-paṇḍita.// Very serious about performing ceremonial rituals, they are called //smārtas.// This //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// also, //Vaiṣṇava-smṛti,// that is also imitation of //smārta-//ism. It is called //smṛti.//

So at least in Europe and America, they will never be able to take all these things. The things should be made shortcut; at the same time, they should be successful. So that is chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// depending on... As soon as we have got some time, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Either loudly or silent... As far as possible loudly; if not possible, silently. But the tongue must go: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. The tongue must work. And as far as possible, should be heard... That is... And officially, //krshkshaharamahaharama...//

[chants very fast, with words running into each other indistinctly]

Not like that.

[chants again like that]

Not like that. That will not... Every word should be distinctly chanted and heard, not official.

So stress on this point. As far as possible, people should be encouraged to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// and try to bring the ecstasy and dance. Even there is no ecstasy, dance; it will bring ecstasy. Dancing is so nice. Chanting, dancing and take //prasādam,// take rest. That's all. Not that you shall take rest like Kumbhakarṇa. [laughs] Just to, I mean to say, answer the call of this deficient body, we have to take little rest. But as far as possible this should be conquered. //Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau.// The Gosvāmīs, they conquered over eating, sleeping... Stress on //saṅkīrtana,// and let them chant and dance as long as possible. If they can chant and dance twenty-four hours, that is very good. That should be stressed.

Just see. The boy yesterday, he came, he said, "Oh, I like this //saṅkīrtana// very much." Immediately. He was talking of so much, //yoga// and this and that, so many nonsense, but he came this morning. He said, "Oh, I will come again. It is very nice." //Saṅkīrtana// has got so power. Stress on //saṅkīrtana,// chant yourself, induce others, dance---whole thing will be success.

And especially outside India, these rituals and ceremonials, that will be simply artificial. They cannot take it seriously. But //saṅkīrtana// they can take seriously. This is practical. And if you recite all the Vedic hymns throughout the whole day they will join, but they will not benefit out of it. So why should we waste? Is that all right? Huh?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. [Prabhupāda laughs] Prabhupāda, regarding Pradyumna's work on the Third Canto?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Satsvarūpa:**
There are some synonyms, and when they are finished, then the books can be published.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he will never finish, so what [indistinct]... [break] [end]
