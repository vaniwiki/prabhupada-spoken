**Yogeśvara:**
She's asking... This is a French nun, and she wishes to know whether for us Christ is the son of God or is He God Himself, or what is the identity of Lord Jesus Christ?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Jesus Christ says that he's son of God. That's all right. We accept.

**Yogeśvara:**
[translates French throughout] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...ordinary son. And he's powerful son. [break]

**Yogeśvara:**
...question. She asks what is the difference between our understanding of reincarnation and the Christian concept of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Christ said he would come again. Is there a difference? Is it the same thing?

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't find anything.

**Yogeśvara:**
There was this gentleman this afternoon who was asking you about people who are constantly..., constantly being tested by all kinds of miserable circumstances. She asks: Is it not a sign of a soul that God has chosen to favor that he sends them such miserable conditions of material life?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Devotee, in miserable condition, they accept it as a favor of God. [break] ...in the //Bhāgavata://

> tat te 'nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇo
> bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam
> hṛd-vāg-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
> jīveta yo mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk
> [SB 10.14.8]

We are put sometimes in difficult position. But a devotee takes the difficult position as mercy of God. [break]

**Yogeśvara:**
She, she asks you for an explanation of an event that happened to her sister. Her sister died at the age of five and a half years. And just before her death, she apparently was able to explain some of her past lifetimes to her mother, that she had formerly been a princess or of noble birth, and that now she was being called. Is there some explanation for that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. She remembers of her last birth. That is quite possible. Because we are changing body. So one who can remember about his past life, they are called //jāta-smaraṇa.//

**Yogeśvara:**
//Jāta-smaraṇa?//

**Prabhupāda:**
One who can remember about his past life. [break] ...means forgetting everything of the past life. [break] ...times a person remembers. [break]

**Yogeśvara:**
She asks for a definition of the word "occult." What is something that is occult, something occult, or mystic? What is it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Mystic?

**Yogeśvara:**
Mystic. What is mysticism?

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not say anything on mysticism. Mystic, something, it is called //rahasya.//

**Yogeśvara:**
//Rahasya?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Rahasya.// Something wonderful. Is that meaning, mystic?

**Indian man:**
Mystic... I mean. I think when Western historians and literators explain Indian religious literature, especially literature of //bhakti-mārga,// they term that those are the mystics, and also they term the Sufi poets are mystics. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...say mystic means //rahasya.//

**Yogeśvara:**
//Rahasya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Rahasya// means it is little difficult to understand. [break]

**French Nun:**
[French] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, rahasyam, rahasyam etad uttamam. Rahasyam etad uttamam.// This //Bhagavad-gītā// is the first-class mystic. //Rahasyam etad uttamaṁ, bhakto 'si me priyo 'si me// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]: "Because you are My devotee, you are My dear friend, you'll understand."

So mysticism is not understandable by common man. It requires a special qualification. Just like to understand, it is also mysticism---understand, to understand God. This is also mystic. It is not understandable by ordinary man.

**Yogeśvara:**
