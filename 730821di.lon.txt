//Goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni.// There is a planet in the spiritual world... The material world, you can see the material sky, limit of the sky, the horizon, but you are not able to reach even the moon planet, the nearest planet. But within this universe, within this horizon, there are innumerable planets. //Aśeṣa. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi vibhūti-bhinnam// [Bs. 5.40]. By the shining effulgence from the body of Kṛṣṇa... That is called //brahma-jyotir.//

Within that //brahma-jyotir,// or effulgence, there are innumerable universes. //Ananta-koṭi. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi. Koṭi// means innumerable. One million... Ten millions equal to one //lakh.// Such hundred //lakhs// makes a //koṭi.// So actually we see there are innumerable planets, but beyond this creation... This is material creation, one-fourth manifestation, one-fourth manifestation of God's creation, this, this material world.

This is also only one universe. There are innumerable universes clustered together, and beyond this clustering of universes there is another sky, which is called //paravyoma,// or spiritual sky. If you want to go there, then you have to penetrate through the material coverings---earth, water, fire, water..., fire, air, like that. Each layer so big. And the next layer is ten times more than the first layer. In this way there are seven layers. So penetrating through that seven layers you reach the spiritual sky. And after reaching the spiritual sky, there are so many Vaikuṇṭha planets, spiritual planets.

So that is summarized: //goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya// [Bs. 5.43]. The topmost planet is called Goloka, or Kṛṣṇa-, Kṛṣṇaloka. //Go// means cows. Kṛṣṇa is very much fond of cows. Therefore that planet is called also Goloka, the planet full of cows. We have recited //Brahma-saṁhitā// today, //cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-lakṣā-vṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam// [Bs. 5.29]. Kṛṣṇa is engaged in tending cows. He's very much fond of cows. //Surabhi.// They are not ordinary cows. In the spiritual world, everything is spiritual. So there is a planet, //goloka-nāmni.// So that is the highest planet. //Goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni.// That is the personal abode. //Goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya// [Bs. 5.43]. Under that planet, there are other planetary systems. They are called Devī-dhāma, Maheśa-dhāma, Hari-dhāma.

Now this universe, this material world, is called Devī-dhāma. Devī-dhāma. It is under the control of the material energy. //Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir-eka chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā// [Bs. 5.44]. This energy is also personified, called Durgādevī. So above this planetary system there is Maheśa-dhāma. Maheśa-dhāma, in the border between spiritual sky and material sky. Above that, there are Hari-dhāma, the Vaikuṇṭha planets, where Nārāyaṇa in various forms is predominating. And above all of them there is Goloka-dhāma, or Kṛṣṇa's //dhāma.//

So picture we have given in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So //goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya devī-maheśa-hari-dhāmasu teṣu teṣu, te te prabhava-nicayā vihitaś ca yena// [Bs. 5.43]. Each planetary system has got specific atmosphere. Everything is specific. So that is done, that is created, by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So in this way, Kṛṣṇa is there in the topmost Goloka-dhāma. But still, //goloka-dhāmni nivasati,// although He is living there, //akhilātmā-bhūto,// He is everywhere. He's everywhere. That is Kṛṣṇa.

Just like we are sitting in this hall; we are not in our apartment house. Kṛṣṇa is not like that. He is, in the //goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni,// in His own planet, He's engaged in His occupation. Somewhere He's tending cows, somewhere He's dancing with the //gopīs.// He is going on with His enjoying occupations. But still He's everywhere. //Goloka-nāmni..., goloka eva nivasaty// [Bs. 5.37]. //Nivasaty// means although He's living there, //akhilātmā bhūtaḥ,// He's everywhere. He's within your heart. //Īśvara sarva bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati.// He's within your heart. Not only within the heart; He is within the atom also. //Eko 'py asau racayituṁ jagad-aṇḍa-koṭim yac-chaktir asti jagad-aṇḍa cayā yad-antaḥ aṇḍantara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. His one plenary portion has entered this material world as Garbhodakaśayī Viṣṇu. From Garbhodakaśayī Viṣṇu, there is expansion of Kṣirodakaśayī Viṣṇu. That Kṣirodakaśayī Viṣṇu has entered every atom. //Eko 'py asau racayituṁ jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi yac-chaktir asti jagad-aṇḍa-caya yad-antaḥ.//

So Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, and if you are devotee, then you can catch Him. This is the secret. Just like electricity is everywhere, electrons. One who can tackle the electrons, they can talk without any direct connection by electronic method, thousand, thousand miles away. Just like radio message, television message. So similarly, Kṛṣṇa is also everywhere. Just like the waves of sound wave is going on. As soon as you produce..., I produce one sound, immediately within a second the sound goes round the earth seven times. So if a material thing has got so much power, just think how much power God has got. So He is everywhere. Simply you have to catch Him. And He's also ready for being caught. Yes. If somebody wants to catch Him... Suppose you are a devotee. If you want to catch Him, He comes forward ten times than your desire. He's so kind. Therefore, we have to simply receive Him.

So this Deity worship in the temple means worshiping Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He's //akhilātmā-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. Where you shall find Him? He's everywhere. Therefore, He has very kindly accepted to assume a form which you can handle. This form of Kṛṣṇa, the atheist will say that "Here is a form made of marble. How is that, they are worshiping God, Kṛṣṇa?" That is atheist view. But from the //śāstra,// we understand Kṛṣṇa, if He is within the atom, why not within the marble? It is simply understanding. Not only within; the marble itself is also Kṛṣṇa. Because in the //Bhagavad-gītā// we understand: //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. These material elements, earth..., earth, water, fire, air, they are Kṛṣṇa's energy. Kṛṣṇa says, //bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā:// "They are My energies, separated energy."

So even if you consider that here is not Kṛṣṇa but a marble, no, that marble is also Kṛṣṇa. Marble is also... And Kṛṣṇa is, being omnipotent, even for your logical argument... Even if you say that this is a marble statue, still Kṛṣṇa is so powerful, omnipotent, that He can accept your service even through this marble. Actually, it is not marble. Or, from spiritual vision, everything being Kṛṣṇa, so Kṛṣṇa can accept your service even through the marble, even through the water, even through the fire. Why not? Energy.

Just like if you come to the sunshine, energy of sun, you immediately touch the sun globe. Is it not? Because the beams are coming from the sun globe, so as soon as you touch the sunshine, sunbeam, you touch the sun immediately. And there are //yogīs// who can reach the sun planet through the beams of sun. Because the spirit soul is very, very small, smaller than the atom. //Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya ca// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 5.9]. And the spirit soul can go everywhere.

And it is, the speed of spirit soul, is greater than the mind. You have got experience of the speed of the mind. In a second you can go many thousands of miles, mind. Suppose you are sitting here, those who are Indians, immediately, within a second, one can reach Calcutta, Bombay. Immediately, without even less than a second's time. The mind's speed... Mind's speed you can imagine. And finer than the mind is the spirit soul. So how much speedy is the spirit soul, that we have to know from the //śāstras. Śāstra yonitvāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.3]. Everything.

Therefore do not think that we have installed a marble statue. The rascals will say, "They are heathens." No. We are worshiping Kṛṣṇa personally. Kṛṣṇa personally, Kṛṣṇa has kindly assumed this form just... Because we cannot see Kṛṣṇa, the gigantic Kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa is everywhere... //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. Our imperfect senses cannot see Kṛṣṇa immediately. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind, as we can see... We can see stone, we can see wood, we can see earth, we can see water, we can see color. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa comes before us just quite suitable for our vision. But He's Kṛṣṇa.

So this Deity worship, those who are in charge of Deity worship, they never should think that "Here is a statue." No. Here is Kṛṣṇa. The honor, the respect, the //samra,// means with great honor... You must always think that "Here is Kṛṣṇa personally." Don't think that it is statue. Kṛṣṇa personally. So you should honor and think also and be cautious so that you may not commit offense. Kṛṣṇa worship, if you neglect the process, then it will be offensive. There are sixty-four kinds of offenses. You have seen it in //The Nectar of Devotion.// So not very much...

You should be very much clean, first thing is. Cleanliness is next to godliness. Very much clean, rise early in the morning, take your bath and perform //maṅgala ārātrika,// then chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// then read scriptures. In this way remain twenty-four hours engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. This is the purpose of installing Deity. Not that after few days you think it is a burden. No, then it will be great offense. It is not burden; it is a great opportunity to serve Kṛṣṇa.

As the //gopīs// are serving in Goloka Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa is so kind, He has come here to accept your service in a manner in which you can handle Him. You can dress Kṛṣṇa, you can offer //prasādam,// you can chant His glory. In this way, always remain engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and gradually you'll find how you are advancing in spiritual life.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
