**Prabhupāda:**
Now he is there also in Los Angeles, our Umāpati.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, Umāpati. In Los Angeles, yes. I saw him when I went there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, he is doing nice there. Now he's //gṛhastha.// He has got a job in Spiritual Sky. So he is now steady. The Spiritual Sky is doing one thing, that providing so many //gṛhastha// devotees.

**Gargamuni:**
Some activity for them to do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Karandhara is managing very nicely, giving them some pocket expense. And instead of renting elsewhere, they are tenant of our house. So we have got tenants, but no trouble from the tenants.

**Devotee:**
Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. When it was suggested that I purchase house, I said that "I am not going to have this tenants' trouble. That is very botheration." So Karandhara suggested that "We have got our own tenants. Why they should stay in other apartment house? If we have got our house, they will stay, and there will be no trouble." "Oh, then it is all right." They require house. So all //gṛhasthas,// they have got separate apartment, living very peacefully. So anyway, every one of us should observe strictly the regulative principles and serve sincerely. Kṛṣṇa will help us.

**Gargamuni:**
In Calcutta we're approaching all of the libraries. At least twenty-five libraries have ordered your books, complete sets.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you see, anywhere we can approach. I sold in Bombay, all libraries, my previous //Bhāgavatam.//

**Gargamuni:**
About ten or twelve books, each bill is about five hundred rupees times twenty-five. That's a lot.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is a respect, if the libraries and school, colleges, they keep our books.

**Gargamuni:**
Some of them are shocked. We went to the National Library in Calcutta. That's the largest library. They saw your books and they said, "Oh, he is doing this work?" They were so impressed. They had never seen Sanskrit or Bengali printed in foreign countries the way you have done in your books. They said, "This is fan..." There's no one else who is doing this in India, no one. Very impressed. And these men themselves are Sanskrit scholars. He immediately started to read. He said, "Oh, very nice." He said, "It is just right." So he was very enthusiastic. There's two boys, they spend the whole day just going to libraries.

**Prabhupāda:**
That has been written by Professor Dayal..., Dimock, that "Sanskrit scholars should get good opportunity, and nobody, I think, will deny Swāmījī's scholarship." He has said that.

**Gargamuni:**
Any name we have in India, any good name we have, is due to you.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] It is due to Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī. Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. So you can give me massage. Thank you very much. Now you have got very, very great responsible work. I will die; you will live. //Kīrtir yasya sa jīvati// [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita]. But I will not die.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, you can never die. [laughter]

**Gargamuni:**
We can't accept that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Gargamuni:**
We refuse to accept it. [end]
