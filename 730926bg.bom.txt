====== Bhagavad-gītā 13.3 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> kṣetra-kṣetrajñayor jñānaṁ
> yat taj jñānaṁ mataṁ mama
> [[books:bg:13:3|[Bg. 13.3]]]

[aside:] Both of them are not in order? Hmm.

[reads from purport:] "While discussing the subject matter of this body and the owner of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find there different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the Supersoul and the individual soul."

Sometimes the Māyāvādī philosophers, they take it for acceptance that there is one soul only, Supersoul. But here we get from Kṛṣṇa, the authoritative source of knowledge, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Not one soul. //Ātmā// and Paramātmā.

[reads from purport:] "Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa says, 'I am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body..."

[loud buzzing sound] What has happened? If it is not working, get it out.

Last night we have already explained that the Supersoul, or Kṛṣṇa, is the knower of the pains and pleasure of every body, whereas the individual soul is the knower of pains and pleasure of his own body. In another place Kṛṣṇa says, //avināśī tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam// [[books:bg:2:17|[Bg. 2.17]]]. The consciousness of the individual soul is spread all over the body. That is //avināśī,// indestructible. That is //avināśī.// Kṛṣṇa says, //avināśī tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam. Yena,// by the soul, he is, by his potency, spread all over the body. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa being the Supersoul, He is not only spread..., His consciousness is not only spread over this my individual body, but His consciousness is spread in..., of all bodies. All over the universe there are 8,400,000 species of forms, and Kṛṣṇa's consciousness is all-pervading. He knows everything.

So as soon as our consciousness becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious... Kṛṣṇa understands. Kṛṣṇa is within your heart. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. So Kṛṣṇa can understand your purpose. We cannot cheat Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa can immediately understand how much serious and sincere you are for understanding Kṛṣṇa or approaching Him or going back to home, back to Godhead. That Kṛṣṇa can understand. As soon as He understands that "Here is a soul, he's very serious," He takes care of you, especially. //Samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu.// Kṛṣṇa, being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is equal to everyone. //Samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo 'sti na priyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:29|[Bg. 9.29]]]. Nobody is dearer or //dveṣa,// or subject, object of jealousy. Kṛṣṇa is not envious, neither specially inclined to everyone. Actually, God's position is neutrality. Everyone. He likes for everyone. //Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. That is also stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// He is friend of everyone.

We are seeking friendship with so many people to get our motive realized. But if we make Kṛṣṇa..., if we know Kṛṣṇa is already ready... In the //Upaniṣad// it is said that two birds in friendly way are sitting in the same tree, the body. So if we understand, "Kṛṣṇa is my best friend..." Kṛṣṇa says, //suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām.// He's not only my friend, your friend, but He's a friend of everyone. So that friendship is equally distributed. But if one becomes special devotee, //ye tu bhajanti māṁ prītyā,// with love and affection, one who is engaged in the service of the Lord, He's especially inclined to him. That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy to the devotee. Kṛṣṇa is equal to everyone, but He is specially inclined to the devotees who is engaged in His service with love and faith.

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te
> [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]

Kṛṣṇa gives him... Because He specially takes cares of the devotee.

So everyone's heart, He is sitting. //Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.// But He takes special care of the devotee, guides him, gives him intelligence. What kind of intelligence? //Yena mām upayānti te.// Just to give him the clue how one can go back to home, back to Godhead. Kṛṣṇa does not give intelligence how one can gain some material prosperity. That is entrusted to the //māyā---devī-māyā,// or Durgādevī.

Therefore people are not very much interested in worshiping Kṛṣṇa. They are generally interested in worshiping Goddess Durgā, Lord Śiva. Because by worshiping Lord Śiva, Goddess Durgā, they get material opulence. So to worship the demigods means cent percent materialism. There is no question of spiritual life. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says... What is that verse? //Naṣṭa-buddhayaḥ. Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante 'nya-devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]. Those who are interested in worshiping other demigods, their intelligence is taken away, //hṛta-jñāna. Kāmais tais tair..., māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.// These terms are there.

//Māyā// is working in two ways: //prakṣepātmikā-śakti, āvaraṇātmikā-śakti. Āvaraṇātmikā-śakti// means she is covering. //Āvaraṇātmikā-śakti,// she is covering. Real fact is covered by //māyā.// Just like the cloud covers the sunshine---we cannot see. Now a few days it is going on, there is cloud always. We do not see the sun. That does not mean there is no sun in the sky. So //māyā// does not allow us to see Kṛṣṇa. That is one //śakti. Āvaraṇātmikā-śakti.// And another //śakti// is //prakṣepātmikā-śakti:// even one desires to see Kṛṣṇa, she throws away. She tests whether actually he wants Kṛṣṇa, or keeping Kṛṣṇa in the front, he wants some material pleasure. Therefore she throws away. In this way //māyā-śakti// is acting. Kṛṣṇa therefore says, //daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. //Māyā// is very powerful. But if one is very rigid in devotional service, //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etān taranti te,// he can overcome the influence of //māyā.//

So //kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi.// So that //kṣetrajña,// knower of the body, Kṛṣṇa, He's also there. He's always ready to help us, provided we are serious about Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. So this is the process of pleasing Kṛṣṇa. Just like we are sitting here together and we are talking about Kṛṣṇa. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is specially meant for talking about Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Caitanya Mahāprabhu ordered,

> āmāra ajñāya guru haña tāra ei deśa
> yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

This is our mission. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we are preaching the teachings of Kṛṣṇa, //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.// Another //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa,// about Kṛṣṇa. //Bhagavad-gītā// is the instruction given by Kṛṣṇa, and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the instruction given by Vyāsadeva and other sages about Kṛṣṇa. So both of them are //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// So that is our mission, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. //Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.// What Kṛṣṇa is instructing directly, that is also //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa,// and what is being spoken about Kṛṣṇa, that is also //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.//

So the //Bhāgavata// process is, if we want to improve, if we want to make our life successful, then we must engage ourself in this program of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or hearing about Kṛṣṇa. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇa.// Kṛṣṇa is there, //kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi.// He is there, Kṛṣṇa, within your heart. So as soon as you are very serious and eager to know about Kṛṣṇa... This is very nice science. If you simply know about Kṛṣṇa, you become liberated. //Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. Simply you try to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Tasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavanti// [//Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// 1.3]. This is the Vedic instruction. If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa, then all other things becomes automatically known. You don't have to make separate endeavor to know. You'll know what is Paramātmā, what is Brahman, what is this material world, what is this material nature, what is our relationship---everything will be revealed. //Teṣām aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ, nāśayāmy ātma-bhāvasthaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa says to special favor.

> teṣām evānukampārtham
> aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ
> nāśayāmy ātma-bhāvastho
> jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā
> [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]]

This is Kṛṣṇa's words in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// If you actually become Kṛṣṇa conscious, the result will be you'll get special favor from Kṛṣṇa. //Teṣām eva anukampārtham.// Kṛṣṇa is specially favorable to the devotees. //Ye tu bhajanti māṁ prītyā.// Therefore this is the beginning. This is the beginning of...

Caitanya Mahāprabhu also accepted this. //Sthāne sthitaḥ śruti-gataṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ. Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva// [SB 10.14.3]. We have to be submissive, not a speculator, that "Now I have become Brahman." Brahman, everyone is Brahman. There is no question of becoming Brahman. We have now forgotten. We have forgotten that we are Brahman. We are misidentifying with this body. This is //māyā.// Otherwise... Therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. It is not that by some process I become Brahman. I am Brahman, but on account of //māyā,// my knowledge is covered. I am thinking, "I am product of this material world," "I am American," "I am Indian," in terms of the soil where we have taken birth. //Yasyātmā-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ// [SB 10.84.13]. //Bhauma ijya-dhīḥ.// The whole world is mad after this process of //bhauma ijya-dhīḥ.// They are... Instead of worshiping Kṛṣṇa, they are worshiping the land in which one is born. That is called under the name of, going on, so many "isms." So this is described as //bhauma ijya-dhīḥ.//

But actually, we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is Para-brahman; therefore we, being part and parcel, we are also Brahman. Just like particles of gold is also gold. So there is no question of becoming Brahman. Brahman we are already. Simply we have to know that "I am not this body." //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi:// "I am spirit soul, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa." That is knowledge. //Jñānaṁ jñeyam. Jñeyam,// this knowledge, that "I am Brahman." And as soon as we are perfectly situated in that spiritual knowledge, //aham brahmāsmi,// then //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. There is no lamentation.

Everyone is lamenting, because he's a //śūdra. Śūdra's// business is to lament. But when one understands, //brāhmaṇa, brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ,// he does not lament. We have seen many //brāhmaṇas,// they are not very materially opulent, but they are happy. They are happy with Kṛṣṇa. That is //brāhmaṇa's// business. //Brāhmaṇa-vaiṣṇava. Brāhmaṇa// must be a Vaiṣṇava, Kṛṣṇa conscious. If a //brāhmaṇa// is not Vaiṣṇava, then he cannot become //guru.// That is the injunction of the //śāstra. Ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. A //vipra,// a //brāhmaṇa,// a learned... //Vipra// means a learned //brāhmaṇa. Veda-pāṭhād bhaved vipraḥ.// One who has learned, studied all the Vedic literatures and has acquired knowledge, he is called //vipra.// So simply studying Vedic literature will not do. //Brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.// He must realize what is Brahman. Then he becomes //brāhmaṇa.//

//Brāhmaṇa// is a qualification. It is not by birth. //Brāhmaṇa...// Just like high-court judge is a qualification. It is not by birth. The high-court judge's son is not a high-court judge unless he has the qualification of a high-court judge. Similarly, a son of a //brāhmaṇa// by birth is not a //brāhmaṇa.// When he has got the brahminical qualification, then he becomes //brāhmaṇa.// That qualification are stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is not imagination. //Śamo damas titikṣavo 'rjavam, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]].

So these things are lost. Therefore India's position is now chaos and confusion, because we have lost this Vedic civilization, we have lost Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we have lost God consciousness. We are being directed by the whims. So it is very lamentable condition of India, although this Kṛṣṇa consciousness is India's original culture, Kṛṣṇa culture. Kṛṣṇa appeared on this land. Although Kṛṣṇa is not for any particular land, but still, Kṛṣṇa appeared in this holy land of Bhārata-varṣa, Mathurā. So it is the duty of the Indians to understand Kṛṣṇa culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness cultural movement, and take part in it seriously.

That is the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He says,

> bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra 
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This is the injunction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that "Anyone who has taken birth in the holy land of Bhārata-varṣa...," //bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya.// Of course, if he's a man. If he's a cat or dog, that is a different thing. But //bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra. Manuṣya-janma.// If he's a human being, then he must take advantage of the Vedic knowledge. //Janma sārthaka kari'.// Otherwise what he'll speak? If he does not know what is what, then what is the meaning of his preaching? No. So //janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra.// It is the duty of every Indian, every man who has taken birth in Bhārata-varṣa, to perform //para-upakāra,// to do well others. Because in the other part of the world there is no such advantage of Vedic literature and Vedic knowledge.

Unfortunately, the Indians are neglecting this Vedic perfection, whereas in other parts of the world, the Europeans and Americans, they are taking interest. So we are not, of course, concerned with any particular nation or country. Our business is to carry out the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. Whomever you meet---it doesn't matter whether he is Indian, European, American or African; anyone---he should be instructed about //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// so that his life may be successful, and the preacher of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his life also will become successful. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

So to become educated in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, this is the beginning---to hear about Kṛṣṇa, to understand about Kṛṣṇa.

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya śravana-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛt satām
> [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]

[loud car horn beeping for some time]

[aside:] What is this?

//Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.// If you kindly hear about Kṛṣṇa seriously... This is our program. We give chance everyone to hear about Kṛṣṇa. We are trying to construct a temple here, not for making any profit, but to give chance to the people about hearing about Kṛṣṇa. This is our mission. We are opening temples all over the world just to give people the chance to hear about Kṛṣṇa. Because as soon as we seriously hear about Kṛṣṇa... //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ, puṇya-śravana-kīrtanaḥ.// The Kṛṣṇa is there. //Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu,// He is there everywhere.

So as soon as that individual soul is seriously engaged in hearing about Kṛṣṇa, immediately the dirty things within his heart becomes cleansed. //Ceto-darpana-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. And as soon as the heart is cleansed, his all problems of this material world is solved. //Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpanam.// Because he understands. Cleansing the heart means to understand that he is not Kṛṣṇa; he's part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. His duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa. This is cleansing of heart. So long it is not cleansed... Just like the Māyāvādī philosophers, they are thinking themselves that they are Kṛṣṇa: "I am God." No. That is unclean. //Vimukta-māninaḥ. Tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. Because their intelligence is not yet clear, it is still with dirty things, therefore they are thinking that they are Kṛṣṇa. No. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and we are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is the philosophy.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa demands in the //Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "Just surrender to Me." It is the right of the master to ask the servant that "You surrender." Similarly, Kṛṣṇa comes to teach this. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ.// Because we are eternally servant of Kṛṣṇa. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they cannot understand. The servant wants to become the master. That is not possible. That is not possible. If the servant remains a faithful servant, that is perfection of his life. Artificially, if the servant wants to become master, that is only botheration.

So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is educating everyone to understand this fact, that everyone is eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. Don't try to imitate Kṛṣṇa. That is botheration. You cannot be happy. Artificially if one wants to become something else which he is not, then it is simply botheration. There is no happiness. An artificial life is not happiness. Natural life is happiness. So naturally we are servant of Kṛṣṇa. If we don't serve Kṛṣṇa then we have to serve //māyā.// Actually, people are engaged. Those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, they have given up the servitude of Kṛṣṇa, but they have accepted the servitude of so many other things. Somebody is thinking, "I am the servant of my country," somebody is thinking, "I am servant of my family," somebody is thinking, "I am servant of my wife," or somebody is thinking, "I am servant of my office boss," or somebody is thinking, "I am servant of my dog." That is also going on. Servant he must remain, but if he does not become servant of Kṛṣṇa, he has to become servant of so many things. He cannot give up his position as a servant. That is not possible. He may change the name in different way, but he remains a servant. That's a fact.

So therefore one who is intelligent, one who is actually intelligent, he thinks that "If my position is to become a servant, why not become the servant of the Supreme?" This is intelligence. //Kāmādināṁ kati na katidhā pālitā durnideśās teṣāṁ mayi na karuṇā jātā na trapā nopaśāntiḥ.// We are servant of our senses, //kāmādināṁ kati na katidhā pālitā durnideśās.// And our senses are dictating so many nonsense things, and we are serving. So therefore one who is not servant of the senses, but one who becomes servant of Kṛṣṇa, then he becomes master of the senses. That is called //svāmī// or //gosvāmī.// One side you have to become servant of Kṛṣṇa; then you become master of the senses. If you do not become servant of Kṛṣṇa, then you become servant of the senses. //Kāmādināṁ kati na...// The whole world is going on, everyone is servant of the senses, //godāsa.// So one has to become //gosvāmī. Go// means senses.

So Kṛṣṇa is advising that "I am in everyone's heart." You can take advice from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is ready. Kṛṣṇa's another name is //caitya-guru. Caitya-guru// means the //guru// who is situated within your heart. Kṛṣṇa comes out as instructor //guru// or initiator //guru// outside, and He is sitting within the heart as //caitya-guru.// Kṛṣṇa is ready to help you, help us, every one of us, in two ways: by the external //guru// and internal //guru.// Internal //guru,// He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, and external //guru,// His manifestation, the spiritual master. So we should take advantage of two //gurus// and make our life successful. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
