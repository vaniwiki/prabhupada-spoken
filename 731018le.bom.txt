Śrīman Nandajī, Ladies and Gentlemen, this scarcity of Kṛṣṇa consciousness was felt long, long ago. When, before starting this movement, I tried to approach many friends in India... Sometimes I think I approached late Mr. Munshi also, when he was governor in U.P. I requested that everyone may contribute a son from the family so that I can convert him an actual //brāhmaṇa.// Because the education at the present moment is creating //śūdras.//

Actually, there are two kinds of //dharmas: paśu-dharma// and //mānava-dharma. Paśu-dharma// means eating, sleeping, sexual intercourse and defending. This is //paśu-dharma. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca sāmānyam etat paśubhiḥ narānām// [//Hitopadeśa//]. Eating, this is essential. Try to understand what is //dharma. Dharma// means which you cannot give up. //Dharma// does not mean you accept this //dharma// today, and tomorrow another //dharma.// That is not //dharma. Dharma// means the natural characteristic. Just like sugar is sweet. That is its //dharma.// And chili is hot. That is its //dharma.// A snake bites. That is his //dharma.// Water is liquid. That is its //dharma.// Stone is solid. That is its //dharma.// You cannot change.

So what is the //dharma// of the living entities, or the human being? Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has enunciated the //dharma// of the human being: //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa-dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. This is //dharma,// that every living entity is eternally servant of Kṛṣṇa. He cannot give it up. If he does not serve Kṛṣṇa, then he will have to serve //māyā.// Service is there. Nobody can say that "I don't serve anyone." Is there anybody who can say boldly that "I do not serve anyone"? You must serve. That is your //dharma.// Either you become a Christian or a Muslim or a Hindu or this or that, your real characteristic is that you have to serve. That service attitude, when it is misunderstood, it is applied to //māyā,// and we are not happy. When it is applied to Kṛṣṇa, then we are happy. Service you must render. That is your position. You cannot become master. Even the politicians, they promise, "I shall give you such-and-such service. Please give me vote." So the service is promised, because we have to serve.

So this definition given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that //jīvera svarūpa haya kṛṣṇa nitya-dāsa:// "The real, original characteristic of the living entity is to serve Kṛṣṇa," that is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa says, //mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]: "All these living entities, they are My parts and parcels." Just try to understand. What is the duty of the parts and parcel? Suppose this finger---they are the parts and parcel of my body. What is the duty of the finger? The finger has to catch the foodstuff or prepare the foodstuff and put into the mouth. The finger cannot enjoy; it has given to the stomach. Similarly, if we are parts and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we cannot enjoy anything directly without giving Kṛṣṇa. That is our duty. //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa-dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]].

So Kṛṣṇa also said in the //Bhagavad-gītā, dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge.//

> yadā yadā hi dharmasya
> glānir bhavati bhārata
> abhyutthānam adharmasya
> tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham
> [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]

So what for Kṛṣṇa comes? Does He come to establish Hindu //dharma,// Muslim //dharma// or Christian //dharma?// If Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, why He should be interested in particular type of //dharma,// Hindu //dharma,// Christian //dharma// or Muslim //dharma?// No. Therefore after giving instruction throughout the whole //Bhagavad-gītā,// at last says, Kṛṣṇa, "The most confidential part of My instruction, Arjuna," //sarva-guhyatamam,// "is this: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]." This is //dharma.// If you are not surrendered soul to Kṛṣṇa, or God, your //dharma// has no meaning. It is useless. And where the definition of //dharma// is given by Kṛṣṇa at the last stage of His instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja,// if one can catch up this point, then he begins //bhāgavata-dharma. Bhāgavata-dharma.//

Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //kaumāraṁ ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. //Kaumāra,// from the very beginning of childhood, one should be taught about //dharma,// especially //bhāgavata-dharma,// the relationship with God. Similarly, in other place it is said,

> sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo
> yato bhaktir adhokṣaje
> ahaituky apratihatā
> yenātmā suprasīdati
> [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]

//Yena ātmā suprasīdati. Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo,// highest type of religious system, //yato bhaktir adhokṣaje,// by which one can learn how to love God---that is //dharma.// Anything else, that is not //dharma.// That is //paśu-dharma.// Nandajī has invented a very nice word, //mānava-dharma.// So //mānava-dharma// means... What is the distinction between //mānava// and //paśu?// That distinction is that a man eats, an animal eats; a man sleeps, an animal sleeps; a man has got sexual intercourse, animal has got sexual intercourse; a man also tries to defend, an animal also tries to defend.

So these four principles of //dharma,// bodily necessities of life, is equal to the man and the animal. If you manufacture very nice, palatable dishes for eating, that does not mean you are advanced in civilization. No. It is eating. So what is the difference between //mānava-dharma// and //paśu-dharma? Mānava-dharma// means what Kṛṣṇa teaches---//sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is //mānava-dharma.// Except this, anything, that is //paśu-dharma.// That is //paśu-dharma.// Therefore //Bhāgavata// says, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]: "All cheating type of //dharma// is kicked out from this //bhāgavata-dharma.//"

So actually, if we are interested in //mānava-dharma,// we should take instruction from the authorities. Don't try to manufacture //dharma.// That is not possible. You cannot manufacture. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣāt bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. //Dharma// means the codes given by God. That is //dharma.// Just like law means given by the state. You cannot manufacture law at your home. That is not possible. Nobody will care for that. Nobody will care for that.

Just like on the street we have got the law, "Keep to the left." So if you say, "Why not go to the right?" you will be immediately arrested; you are criminal. Because it is law by the state. By your consideration, where is the difference between going... In some countries, in England... England is "Keep to the left," India. America is "Keep to the right." So this may be changed in different countries and different laws, but law means which is given by the state. Similarly, //dharma// means which is given by God. You cannot manufacture //dharma.// That will not be applicable.

So therefore Kṛṣṇa says, the Supreme Personality of Godhead says, that "I descend." //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. What is that //glāniḥ?// When one forgets Kṛṣṇa, or God, and manufacture his own religion, //paśu-dharma,// he cannot be happy. That is not possible. Just like if you make your own laws, you cannot be happy. You must obey the laws of the state. Similarly, what is the law of God? That is //dharma. Dharmaṁ tu sākṣāt bhagavat-praṇītam. Dharma// cannot be manufactured by any man or any demigod or any saintly person or... No.

The //dharma// is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, which He says as the last instruction in the //Bhagavad-gītā: sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. And actually it is happening all over the world. Since we have presented this //dharma,// to serve Kṛṣṇa, it is working very wonderfully. We have got branches all over the world, and you will find... Some of the samples you will see, those who are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// these Europeans, Americans, Canadians---we have got even branch in Iran also---Muhammadans, Christians, Africa. Everyone is taking to this //dharma,// this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu enunciated, //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. //Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.// There is a conflagration of flame all over the world on account of godless civilization, this nonsense civilization. We have to stop it. Then you will be happy. You cannot become happy without God. That is not possible. Therefore if you actually interested to spread //dharma,// you take the principles of //Bhagavad-gītā,// standard, //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. Don't try to interpret in a fashionable way: "This means that; that means that." No. "Kṛṣṇa" means Kṛṣṇa. "Kṛṣṇa" means...

Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "My dear Dhanañjaya, there is no more superior authority than Me." You have to accept that. Kṛṣṇa says, //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.// You have to accept that. Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. You have to accept that. Then you will be able to..., you will be successful. Otherwise it is useless waste of time. //Śrama eva hi kevalam. Śrama eva hi kevalam.//

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed ratiṁ yadi
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

You can execute your so-called //dharmas,// but if it does not help you to understand what is God, then it is useless waste of time. It is useless waste of time. //Śrama eva hi kevalam.//

So actually, this Bhārata-varṣa is the land of //dharma.// Even some Communist Chinese gentleman, he has written a book... That is recommended in the New York University. He says that "If you want to know about //dharma,// you must go to India and learn there." We have got so facility. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara paropakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

"Anyone who has taken birth as a human being in the land of Bhārata-varṣa, first of all let him become perfect and distribute the knowledge all over the world." That is //paropakāra.//

So I shall request that there is great need of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world. It is only one man's attempt. If persons like Nandajī and others, living persons... //Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ lokas tad anuvartate// [[books:bg:3:21|[Bg. 3.21]]]. Nandajī is one of the //śreṣṭha-vekti// of India. He was minister in the central government. Now he is out of office. But the man is the same. I was very glad when I received the literature. I thought, "At least one man in India is thinking that India is so much downfallen." So I was very much encouraged. Otherwise, I was very much discouraged that there is no human being in India, because they have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, forgotten God. Now I see there are still.

So I shall request Nandajī that take the standard method as prescribed in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Then you will be successful. Not only Nandajī---anyone. The example is already there. I am preaching all over the world //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. There is no fashionable interpretation. No. As it is. And how they are being accepted. So why not in this country? And in this country Kṛṣṇa consciousness is natural. It is not artificial. From the birth of a man, he is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Artificially he is being cut down, "Forget Kṛṣṇa." This nonsense //dharma// should be stopped. Take Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is being accepted all over the world. Why not in India? Why you present competitors of Kṛṣṇa? Don't do this. Take this instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā,// that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. You will be successful. If you manufacture something, you will never be successful. I tell you.

So anyone, the standard is there, the instruction is there, everything is there. Why should we try to manufacture something new? //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. //Dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhayaṁ mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ.// That is our process. //Tarko 'pratiṣṭhanam.// Simply by argument, you cannot reach the confidential part of //dharma. Śrutayo vibhinnā.// And if you study //Vedas,// that is also..., //Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg, Atharva,// you will be puzzled. So, //nāsau munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam// [[books:cc:madhya:25:57|[Cc. Madhya 25.57]]]. He is not a philosopher or a //muni// who cannot give a separate theory.

So these things are going on. Therefore how to know what is the purpose of //dharma?// That is stated, that //dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyāṁ mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. Just follow, try to, //mahājana.//

Who can be better //mahājana// than Kṛṣṇa? Is there anybody in this world still now better than Kṛṣṇa, who can give good instruction, more beneficial than Kṛṣṇa? No. There is not. So take this principle, //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, the instruction of //Gītā,// instruction of Kṛṣṇa, and try to follow. It will be successful not only in India; all over the world. That is my practical experience.

Thank you very much. [applause] [end]
