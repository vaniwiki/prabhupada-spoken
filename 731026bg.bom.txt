**Pradyumna: **"Now hear, O son of Pṛthā, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt." [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
So, which language I shall use? English or Hindi? If I speak in Hindi...

**Guest:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
But if I speak in Hindi they'll not understand. As you say. Hmm? Majority? [laughter] Shall I speak in English? [Hindi] Thank you. So they want me to speak in Hindi, We got permission? [Hindi] [laughter] So, shall I speak in Hindi? [laughter] Hey?

**Devotee:**
A little of both? Maybe a little of both?

**Prabhupāda:**
Both [indistinct] ...little? Hmm.
