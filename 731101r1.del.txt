**Prabhupāda:**
//...gatvā duḥkhānusaṅgaminaḥ.// There is misery. Even you go to the moon planet... This is //Bhāgavata.// Before going to your moon planet, here is the information: "Anywhere you go, rascal, these things will follow, //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]], and inconveniences you'll have suffer." So one is..., one who is intelligent, then, "Where shall I find real happiness?" That is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore one requires to be very, very intelligent to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. //Sarva, sarvatra bhasananvita//[?].

The Śrīdhara Svāmī gives note, //sarvatra lokāntare 'pi.// Even if you go to other planet... Now these rascals are going now... Trying, not going. And in the //Bhāgavata// says, //lokāntare 'pi.// Even in other planets. They were going in other planets. That means they were going in other planets; otherwise how it is stated, //lokāntare,// "in other planets also"? From the statement it appears that people used to go. And here, Arjuna went to heavenly planet. And there the [break] ...heavenly prostitute came to Arjuna. She's prostitute. So when Arjuna refused, that... His father is Indra.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Arjuna said that "You have connection with my father. Therefore you are my mother."

**Śrutakīrti:**
You mentioned him in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// purport. When one //yogī// was performing severe austerities, Lord Indra would send the dancing girls, they were called.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Apsarās.//

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Apsarās.//

**Śrutakīrti:**
He would send them.

**Prabhupāda:**
The same thing here. Just like prostitute. They are going to the club. The father is going also; the son is going. And the prostitute is the same. Everywhere, this material happiness---wine, women...

**Brahmānanda:**
I think there... That boy, Ranchor, his father said, "You leave Kṛṣṇa consciousness and I will give you a car and women."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Your father also said like that. [laughter] Here father will feel shame to advise the son, or the son will feel shame to talk about sex with father or mother.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
About sex one can talk with friends, not with father and mother.

**Brahmānanda:**
Not with...

**Prabhupāda:**
But in Western countries it is very open talk. In open business also. //Sarvatra. Sarvatra lokāntare 'pi vasanavagatya iha duḥkhānusaṅghanena, iha nivṛtta-kāma...//[?] So one should give up this material sense gratification. The more you become entangled with material sense gratification, more you'll have to remain in this material world. [reading from Vīrarāghavācārya commentary] //Iti tiprokti malakam uktaṁ kāma karma prokta gena iti, ahaṁ deva upasya yesantai saṅghata nirvaira adrstitvaṁ samyag anvasya duḥkha, sukha-duḥkha eva, sukha-duḥkha...//[?] Water is wasted?

**Śrutakīrti:**
Almost full. Very slow.

**Prabhupāda:**
Vīrarāghavācārya: //deha-geha-gehayoḥ ātmiya buddhiḥ jihasaya tyāgecchāya//[?]. //Ātma-buddhi,// this family, society, friendship and love. Yes. To feel very much affection... What is called? Attached. //Tyāgecchā.// It should be given up. Therefore the //sannyāsa āśrama.// Just try to deliver this message very... Everyone is in darkness. Therefore I was speaking. They do not know what is //siddhi.// Yesterday, you were present? Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not know what is //siddhi.// What is perfection of life, they do not know. Neither they have information.

**Brahmānanda:**
Simply they talk about it.

**Prabhupāda:**
All foolish. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. Blind man leading other blind men. There is no sense. Whole civilization. It is, this Kṛṣṇa con..., our movement is a challenge to everyone---a challenge, general challenge. After all, everyone wants happiness, but they do not know what is happiness.

[pause]

So you can make few //purīs// and //khicuṛi.// That's all.

**Brahmānanda:**
Śrutakīrti? Prabhu?

**Śrutakīrti:**
Pālikā is already cooking.

**Prabhupāda:**
Alright.

**Brahmānanda:**
//Purīs,// he said.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Cāpāṭi// can also be...

**Śrutakīrti:**
//Purī// or //parāṭā,// I think, would be...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Parāṭā// can do.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes, she is...

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can give me massage now.

**Brahmānanda:**
Massage him.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes. All right.

**Brahmānanda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [offers obeisances]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sarvatra vasanava gatya//[?]. So if this advertisement attracts some people, then I can remain here...

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...to organize this...

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...for some time. Oh, they have got a bath also?

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yamunā has... She has...

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Yamunā?

**Śrutakīrti:**
I guess she is out shopping also.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sarvatra vyasanad apy atra...//[?] Now here, as soon as we came, we thought it very nice---immediately...

**Śrutakīrti:**
So many things.

**Prabhupāda:**
So many inconveniences. [laughter] //Vyasanad apy atra.// Wherever you go, even though you found it is very convenient, very nice, you must know there is..., there is inconvenience. Don't be so sure that it is full of nice things. No. That is not possible. //Sarvatra vyasanad api.// What is that?

**Śrutakīrti:**
Fifteen minutes of water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So you, you can get that connection disconnected now. Otherwise you're going...

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes. I could also connect over to here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. For the time being, you disconnect. Otherwise it will fall down...

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...with water. Then you create another inconvenience. Yes. That's it. You have taken your bath? Not yet?

**Brahmānanda:**
In the morning we took.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have taken?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where is your oil?

**Śrutakīrti:**
I have it. [break] [end]
