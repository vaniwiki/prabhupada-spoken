====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...for others it is said. For Kṛṣṇa, it is mercy. The //gopīs// came with lust. They became purified with Kṛṣṇa's association. //Gopīs,// actually, superficially, externally, they are..., means, //nitya-siddha,// ever-liberated expansion of Kṛṣṇa's energy, internal energy. But apparently, they left their father, husband and came to Kṛṣṇa. So that is, from Vedic principle, it is wrong.

One young girl cannot go to other young man, giving up the protection of father, brother and... So they did it. So they, according to Vedic principle, it is sinful. But because it was related with Kṛṣṇa, they became purified. That means any way if one comes in contact with Kṛṣṇa, he becomes purified, even though he's sinful. That is Kṛṣṇa's... That is the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Sun is never infected. Rather, the infected area becomes sterilized by the sunshine. This is the process. That is explained. //Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya// [SB 10.33.29]. One who is very powerful, he has no fault. So how your temperature is going on?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Everything is getting very nicely improved.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Śyāmasundara:**
You've got some cold?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
I got everything, still, I haven't got anything. [laughter] So you can invite the neighboring people. We can hold evening class or morning class. I'll give you one matter for... [break] This is nice place. If you invite the neighboring..., they may come and take advantage.

**Śyāmasundara:**
It looks like an American neighborhood.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
It looks like an American neighborhood.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is very nice place. So you are also helping Tejiyas?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Tomorrow morning I'm meeting with Indira Gandhi...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh!

**Śyāmasundara:**
...and the American ambassador.

**Prabhupāda:**
If Indira Gandhi comes one day...

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...that will be very nice.

**Śyāmasundara:**
We're thinking if we can get either one of those two, then everyone else will come very easily. They'll give money, everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. It is very nice. Indira Gandhi knows our movement. Is it not? Yes, she knows.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes. I approached her that you are the great..., the greatest emissary of Kṛṣṇa, of Indian culture outside of India. So...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is a fact. But these rascals do not appreciate it. Others are appreciating.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
The foreign countries, they're appreciating, "Here is real Indian culture." They should also appreciate by the result.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes, that's the point.

**Prabhupāda:**
By the result, not theoretical.

**Śyāmasundara:**
No. So we were showing pictures and books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Every sane man should appreciate. When European and American young men, who are after material sense gratification, they're taking //sannyāsa,// it is not joke. They should appreciate it. In an age where material sense enjoyment is very prominent, and they give up everything for Kṛṣṇa, and they're going far away from their comfortable position... Just like Brahmānanda has gone to Africa. So what for? Unless they appreciate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, how they take up this job? This is practical. There is no question of theoretical.

**Brahmānanda:**
You said that last night when you spoke that about that we are actually //siddhas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [laughs]

**Brahmānanda:**
We are not...

**Prabhupāda:**
That I wanted to prove... [laughs]

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...that these boys are //siddhas.// Others, they do not know what is //siddhi.//

**Brahmānanda:**
They have not even left family connection, you said.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] That I... That Mr. Kapur...

**Brahmānanda:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
...talking high talks. Simply high words will not do.

**Śyāmasundara:**
I think..., I think it will be good, though, if we flatter Mrs. Gandhi also, a little flattery.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Let her think that we are praising her leadership of the country.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Yes, flatter that.... You can say that "You'll be glorified when India will be glorified. So this culture will glorify India."

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
"And Prabhupāda has introduced."

**Śyāmasundara:**
It is now already...

**Prabhupāda:**
"So you should cooperate with us."

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
"This is India's original culture, Kṛṣṇa culture." And ninety percent of the people, they are Kṛṣṇa devotees, of India. There is no doubt about it.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So... And this has got the potency of being spread all over the world. All over the world.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hmm. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Some news has come out in //Jugantor// that Queen Elizabeth is reading our //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Śyāmasundara:**
That was from that time David Wynne gave her that //Bhagavad-gītā...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Śyāmasundara:**
...to read while she was sitting for him for the sculpture.

**Prabhupāda:**
So it has come to her attention.

**Śyāmasundara:**
I think he has told that story to several people, and the word has spread.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Brahmānanda:**
Where did you hear it from?

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway, that our, our architect, that Mr. Lahiri

**Brahmānanda:**
Surabhi. Oh, Mr. Lahiri.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has seen in the //Jugantor Press.//

**Śyāmasundara:**
It was in the newspaper here in India. [laughter] She did! She read it one day for three hours, four hours.

**Brahmānanda:**
You're kidding!

**Prabhupāda:**
And the latest report is that //Bhagavad-gītā// is selling fifteen thousand copies per month in London? Who told me? Thirty thousand copies sold in two months.

**Śyāmasundara:**
It was Macmillan's biggest selling book in England.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That also you can inform her. And present her one copy.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. One copy of //Bhāgavata.//

**Śyāmasundara:**
I gave her one copy of...

**Prabhupāda:**
Who arranged this meeting?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Well, we did. We just went.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Śyāmasundara:**
And with the American Ambassador, we have left him today one copy of //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Śyāmasundara:**
And tomorrow we can...

**Prabhupāda:**
You can refer that Mr., what is his..., last ambassador?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Keath, Keating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Keating.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes, I already have given him one copy...

**Prabhupāda:**
He knows us very well.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is that...? He gave us some letter?

**Śyāmasundara:**
We gave already that copy to the Ambassador.

**Prabhupāda:**
And he liked this movement.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Also I gave the papers...

**Prabhupāda:**
And "We are American. You can ask about this movement."

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes, I said that also. I said, because most of your disciples are American, and "You are an American practically..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Ah. "So you can test us. You can test us."

**Śyāmasundara:**
Also, politically speaking, now it is time Mrs... Mrs. Gandhi is being criticized now by Hindus because she took sides with these Arabs during this war.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. She is very highly criticized.

**Śyāmasundara:**
So she needs to get some political benefit from associating with Hindus during some functions just now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That will counteract.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
And also he needs that association with India leaders. Because America is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. If she comes, then we shall have to give a nice speech so that she may be convinced.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes. Very flatter... I think, I think we should flatter her completely.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
No controversy. And this...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that "If you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, naturally everything will be correct." Just like Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja was Kṛṣṇa conscious. And can, you can read the portion during the reign of Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja, how nature was helping. //Kāmaṁ vavarṣa.// You keep one set of books here. //Kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. "Due to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's being Kṛṣṇa conscious, everything was going on nicely. So by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, you are on the post of Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja. So if you take standard, it will be good for everyone. And so far secular state is concerned, we are actually secular. In this movement, all classes of men are here."

**Śyāmasundara:**
I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you'll have to preach to her. Because she won't listen to... If I can just get her to agree to be the chief guest...

**Prabhupāda:**
And accept the book. That is all right.

**Śyāmasundara:**
That's all I can do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
If you preach to her, she'll listen.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
But she won't listen if I preach to her.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no. That is not possible. That I know. You simply try to...

**Śyāmasundara:**
Induce her to come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, to join us at least one day.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And accept the book, read it, at least the introductory portion, Preface portion.

**Śyāmasundara:**
I can show her politically how it would be advantageous for her to come. That much I can do.

**Prabhupāda:**
I, I... I don't think you should advise him, her...

**Śyāmasundara:**
I mean I don't need to, really.

**Prabhupāda:**
...about politics.

**Śyāmasundara:**
She knows it. She knows that you... And also this American ambassador could use some favorable publicity.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, this //Bhagavad-gītā// contains everything---politics, sociology, religion, philosophy. So this culture should be spread; this India's culture, original culture, should be spread. And we are endeavoring that. And it is becoming successful.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Also we are meeting the Minister of Defence, Jagjivan Ram. And Dr. Karan Singh is coming back on Monday. He's been out. And Uma Shankar Diksit tomorrow morning also, the Minister of...

**Prabhupāda:**
Uma Shankar Diksit.

**Śyāmasundara:**
...Home Affairs. Minister of Home Affairs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Big post.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, these politicians are politicians. Anyway, we...

**Śyāmasundara:**
At least if they come, everything will be successful.

**Prabhupāda:**
Indira... Simply Indira Gandhi comes, it will be tremendous success.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes. Crowds will come. People will donate money for the //paṇḍāl.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So when the //paṇḍāl// will be erected?

**Tejiyas:**
It will begin on the fourth, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tejiyas:**
It will begin on the fourth.

**Prabhupāda:**
That place is nice, but it is not as public as the L.I.C.

**Tejiyas:**
We need some... For that reason, we need some very good chief guest and some good publicity.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
We arranged some newspaper publicity today. So... And he's arranged banners and posters and... Enough people will come.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got some fruits?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Mostly, I think they'll come because they remember before, when you were here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] [end]
