**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [leads chanting of verse, etc.] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

> nidrayā hriyate naktaṁ
> vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ
> divā cārthehayā rājan
> kuṭumba-bharaṇena vā
> [[books:sb:2:1:3|[SB 2.1.3]]]

Translation: "The lifetime of such envious householders is passed at night either in sleeping or in sex indulgence, and in the daytime either in making money or maintaining family members."

**Prabhupāda:**

> nidrayā hriyate naktaṁ
> vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ
> divā cārthehayā rājan
> kuṭumba-bharaṇena vā
> [[books:sb:2:1:3|[SB 2.1.3]]]

This is the description of the persons who are blind. //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. Yesterday we have discussed this verse. //Apaśyatām// means one who does not see. //Apaśyatām, paśyati. Paśyati// means "one who sees," and //apaśyati,// "one who does not see," "blind." So there are two kinds of men within the world: //paśyati, apaśyati.// Simply having the eyes, one cannot see. This is not... Because our senses are imperfect. We see every day the sun just like a small disc. But it is not a small disc. It is fourteen hundred thousand times bigger than this planet. Therefore our sensual perception is not all. That is not perfect. We are deficient: we commit mistake, we are illusioned, we cheat, and our senses are imperfect. As such, there is no possibility of having perfect knowledge by a conditioned soul. That is not possible.

We have to receive knowledge, therefore, from the Supreme Perfect. That is real knowledge. Just like we have got experience that nobody knows that there is soul. Nobody knows. But we have to receive the knowledge from the perfect person, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says there is soul. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam..., tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. //Asmin dehe,// in this body, there is the proprietor of the body, the soul. But if we want to see... Some rascal says, "Show me where is soul." He cannot see, because he has no eyes to see. These modern materialistic person, they want to see everything, but he does not understand that his seeing power is very limited.

If the light is off, immediately he cannot see. So what is the value of your eyes? Why you are so much proud to see everything? "Can you show me God? Can you show me the soul?" You cannot see. You have no eyes to see. And what you cannot see, you can hear. Just like a blind man, he is sitting; he cannot see. Somebody comes. He inquires, "Who has come here?" Now, if somebody says, "It is such-and-such person," by hearing only he can understand, "Oh, such-and-such person has come." So seeing is not extremely perfect experience. There are other senses.

So which is beyond the sense perception you have to hear. Therefore Vedic knowledge is called //śruti.// You have to hear. Not by seeing; simply by hearing. //Śravaṇam.//

> śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
> smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam
> arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ
> sakhyam ātma-nivedanam
> [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]

If you want to know the Supreme, then you have to hear from Him. Just like about Kṛṣṇa, we have to hear from Him. Kṛṣṇa is speaking //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa is speaking everything. All Vedic knowledge is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is speaking. How Kṛṣṇa is speaking? That is mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Kṛṣṇa spoke to Brahmā. //Ādi-kavi// means Brahmā. He spoke to him. But if somebody says, "Brahmā..., when Brahmā was born from the lotus flower, there was nobody there. So how he could hear from anybody?" therefore //Bhāgavata// says, //tene brahma hṛdā. Hṛdā// means "through the heart." Through the heart he was educated. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's another name is //caitya-guru. Caitya-guru// means "the guru who is sitting within your heart." //Caitya-guru.// But He does not speak to anyone. He speaks to everyone, but only the devotee can hear. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te
> [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]

Unless you are a devotee, unless you are constantly engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, He will not speak to you. He speaks, but you cannot hear. You have no ears to hear Him. That is not possible. Kṛṣṇa is speaking. Just like Kṛṣṇa is speaking in the //Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. It is open speaking, but who is hearing? Nobody is hearing. Nobody is hearing. They have got their own conception of life.

Therefore, unless there is mercy of Kṛṣṇa, there is no possibility of understanding Kṛṣṇa. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. By your these blunt material senses you cannot understand what is the name of Kṛṣṇa, //nāmādi.//

**Guest:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi.//

[aside:] That's all right. Why you are bothering?

//Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ.// In these blunt material senses you cannot understand what is this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// It requires purification of the senses, when you will understand what is Kṛṣṇa's name, //nāmādi,// what is Kṛṣṇa's form, what is Kṛṣṇa's quality, what is Kṛṣṇa's entourage, what is Kṛṣṇa's pastime. You cannot understand. How you will be understanding? //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.// When you are engaged in the loving service of the Lord, beginning with your tongue, //sevonmukhe hi jihvādau,// by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// and taking //prasādam,// in this way, gradually, when you will be purified, you will understand what is Kṛṣṇa. He will reveal. Kṛṣṇa reveals. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. For others, He is covered with //yogamāyā//'s curtain, but for the devotees, He is open.

This is the secret. //Vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau// [Bs. 5.33]. If you simply study //Veda,// you will never be able to understand Kṛṣṇa. Therefore so many so-called Vedāntists, they do not know what is Kṛṣṇa. They consider Kṛṣṇa as ordinary human being. //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. So the //mūḍhas,// the rascals, they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Only the devotees. //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. If you want to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth, then you will have to accept this process, //bhakti.// Kṛṣṇa never says that "By //jñāna,// by //yoga,// by //karma// you can understand." No.

> bhaktyā mām abhijānāti
> yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ
> tato māṁ tattvato jñātvā
> viśate tad-anantaram
> [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]

These things are...

So the //gṛhamedhis,// as I have described last night, they are not interested, //gṛhamedhis. Apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. //Gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām,// those who are simply attached to this bodily conception of life, they are unable to see the truth. //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam.// They cannot see. Their only business is... That is described here: //nidrayā hriyate naktam.//

[aside:] Yes, come if you like.

Their business is, these //apaśyatām ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]], those who are blind, those who cannot see, the //ātma-tattvam,// "What I am," such persons, what is their business occupation?

That is the distinction between devotee and nondevotee. A nondevotee, he is very much happy by sleeping. We have seen it practically in Western countries. You know very well. If they can sleep twenty-four, -five hours instead of twenty-four hours, they are very happy. They think that they are getting some profit. Not only Western countries. I have seen long, long, about fifty years ago in Calcutta, the office peons, they took letters for distributing to other men, but what do they do? They will sleep at Dalhousie Square with the peon book. I have seen. They thought that "This sleeping is our gain. We are getting salary. That is another gain. But because without working I am sleeping now for three hours in Dalhousie Square, it is as another gain."

So this is the conception of the... [someone coughs loudly] Disturb [Hindi]. So sleeping is also pleasure, but for the devotees, for advanced devotees, just like Gosvāmīs in Vṛndāvana, //śrī-rūpa-sanātana-bhaṭṭa-raghunātha,// they conquered over sleeping. //Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. Vijitau,// they conquered over sleeping. That is required. Just like Arjuna is addressed, "Guḍākeśa." He conquered over sleeping. To conquer over sleeping is the success of life, not to be servant of sleeping. That is not required. That is for the conditioned soul. //Nidrayā hriyate naktam.// For conditioned soul... Therefore we have to practice.

//Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau. Śrī-gaurāṅga-guṇānuvarṇane śraddhā-samṛddhy-anvitau, nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau cātyanta-dīnau ca yau.// This is the description of the Gosvāmīs. Rūpa Gosvāmī used to sleep generally one and half hour only. And that is also sometimes not sleeping. That is the description in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//

So to increase sleeping is no qualification. To decrease sleeping. //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca sāmānyam etat paśubhir narāṇām// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. Eating, sleeping, sex life and defending, these business is meant for the animals. So we have got the animal portion of our life, because we are animals. Unless we come to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness point, we are simply animals. Those who are working on the bodily concept of life whole day and night, they are simply animals. Their business is to sleep as much as possible at night. //Nidrayā hriyate naktam.//

Otherwise, //vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ. Vyavāya. Vyavāya// means sex. Two business at night: either sex indulgence or sleep. This is //ātma-tattvam apaśyatām// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. //Apaśyatām.// Those who are awakened to the //ātma-tattva,// they will simply think, "How much time I have wasted." That is... //Avyartha-kālatvam// [[books:cc:madhya:23:18-19|[Cc. Madhya 23.18-19]]]. //Avyartha kā...// A devotee should be always alert whether he is wasting time or utilizing time. That is devotee's business.

So this //nidrayā hriyate naktam// or //vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ,// this is wasting life, wasting time. It should be minimized as far as possible. This is not required. This is the bodily necessities of life. And we have to come to the spiritual platform. We have to be engaged only in spiritual activities. But those who are not interested in self-realization, there must be some engagement. There are two things: Kṛṣṇa or //māyā.// Just like darkness and light. Where there is Kṛṣṇa there is no darkness. //Kṛṣṇa sūrya-sama, māyā andhakāra// [[books:cc:madhya:22:31|[Cc. Madhya 22.31]]]: "//Māyā// is just like darkness, and Kṛṣṇa is just like sunlight." So as soon as there is sunlight, there is no darkness. Just like this is night.

What does it mean, night? Means there is no sunlight. Sunlight is there in other part of this globe, but here there is no sunlight; therefore it is darkness. Similarly, as soon as we are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is //māyā,// immediately. Either //māyā// or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you are not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you should understand that you are in //māyā.// And if you are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then there is no //māyā. Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. These are the open description. Anyone who is fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he has no //māyā.//

Now, this does not mean that we shall completely exclude sleeping. That does not... Just like Gosvāmīs. They were liberated person, but they were also sleeping. Because we have got this body, sleeping, rest, is necessary. But we cannot neglect this body. But not that, that we shall increase the necessities of life, increase the necessities of the body. That is... Rūpa Gosvāmī has given: //nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate// [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.255]. We have to, I mean to say, mold our life in such a way. What is that? //Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ.//

This is //viṣaya. Viṣaya// means this //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. This is called //viṣaya. Viṣaya// does not mean one who is very rich man, he is //viṣayī.// No. Anyone, he may be very poor man, if he is attached to this eating, sleeping, mating and defending only, he is a //viṣayī.// The Locana dāsa Ṭhākura says, //viṣaya chāṛiyā, se rase majiyā// [//Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nityānander Dayā// 2]. One has to gradually give up, minimize, this //viṣaya. Viṣaya// means //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna. Viṣaya.//

So Rūpa Gosvāmī gives the instruction, //anāsaktasya viṣayān. Anāsakta. Anā...,// means no attachment. Sleeping required, but not for attachment. Somebody is living for sleeping, and somebody is sleeping just to give rest to the body. Similarly, eating also. Eating is not prohibited. You have to eat, because you have got this body. But not that simply for eating I am living. This is called //yukta-vairāgya.//

Rūpa Gosvāmī says, //anāsaktasya viṣa...// Don't be attached to the //viṣaya,// eating, sleeping, mating, that "I have to eat so much. I have to satisfy my palate. I have to eat this thing in the restaurant." No. You eat simply just to keep your body fit, not extra. //Atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ// [NoI 2]. Don't eat more than it is required for maintaining your body. Similarly, don't sleep more; as much as you require for maintaining your...

Don't have sex life more than it is required. They are allowed. Just like Kṛṣṇa says that "Sex life which is not against religious principle, that is I am." Sex life against religion, what is that? //Avaidha-strī-saṅga. Avaidha,// illicit sex life, that is against religious principle. Otherwise, to get married and to beget nice children, Kṛṣṇa conscious children, according to //śāstra,// that sex life is not forbidden. Kṛṣṇa says. So //dharmāviruddhaḥ kāma aham,// "Which is not against religious principle, that //kāma,// that kind of lust, I am." But not for other purposes.

In this way we have to mold our life if we are actually interested to become free from this //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]], if we actually want to get free from the repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. That is our real problem. People do not understand that this is our real problem. They are simply engaged in some temporary problem. The real problem is that "Why I am dying? In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]: 'The soul does not die even after the destruction of this body.' So why my body should be destroyed?" This is real inquiry. "Why... Can I not get a permanent body which will never be destroyed?" Yes. You'll get. You will get. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]], Kṛṣṇa says. "You will get a permanent body. After giving up this body," //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]], "you do not get again material body." "Then where shall I go?" //Mām eti:// "You come to Me." If you go back to home, back to Kṛṣṇa, then, as Kṛṣṇa has got eternal body, never to be destroyed, similarly Kṛṣṇa has got eternal body.

Don't think that Kṛṣṇa has got a body like us. Just like Kṛṣṇa, when it was inquired by Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa said that "This //Bhagavad-gītā// philosophy I spoke first of all to the sun-god." That you have calculated, it is about 400,000,000's of years ago He said. How does He remember? That means He does not change His body. We, we forget, because just like in our last, past birth... Now I can remember not all, but some of my incidences of my life I remember. But I do not remember anything of my past life. Death means forgetting about the past life. So because I have changed my body, I have forgotten. But anyone who does not change his body, he does not forget. And that is the proof that Kṛṣṇa..., Kṛṣṇa's body is not ordinary body. Anyone who thinks Kṛṣṇa as one of us, he is a //mūḍha. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. Because He comes just like a human being, we consider that He is also a human being.

So it is a great science. Therefore Parīkṣit Mahārāja inquired about Kṛṣṇa, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī is describing, and he immediately said, //varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:1|[SB 2.1.1]]]: "Your question is very glorified." //Yad loka-hitam:// "It will be..." //Varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ kṛto loka-hitaṁ nṛpa.//

> varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ
> kṛto loka-hitaṁ nṛpa
> ātmavit-sammataḥ puṁsāṁ
> śrotavyādiṣu yaḥ paraḥ
> [[books:sb:2:1:1|[SB 2.1.1]]]

Kṛṣṇa //praśna// and Kṛṣṇa answer. So answer is //śrotavya.// So //śrotavyādi,// we are hearing so many answers. Just like you go to the market. We question and answer. There are so many questions, so many answers. But this Kṛṣṇa question and Kṛṣṇa answer, //śrotavyādiṣu yaḥ paraḥ---paraḥ// means superior or transcendental---this is not material things. //Nārāyaṇaḥ paraḥ avyaktāt.// Anything about Nārāyaṇa, that is not of this material world; that is of the spiritual world. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa question and Kṛṣṇa answers, they are not material things. Therefore, if we always engage ourself in Kṛṣṇa question and Kṛṣṇa answer... //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. Therefore it is called Viṣṇu. Not that any other //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam.// Only Viṣṇu.

Viṣṇu means //viṣṇu-tattva. Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan// [Bs. 5.29]. //Viṣṇu-tattva// means //rāmādi-mūrti.// Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, Kṛṣṇa... There are so many. They are described. They are //viṣṇu-tattva. Viṣṇu-tattva, jīva-tattva, śakti-tattva.// There are different //tattvas.// So //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam.// If you engage yourself in //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam,// that should be for Viṣṇu, not for any other, anyone else. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇam. Smaraṇam,// meditation. That is also Viṣṇu. The //yogīs,// those who are actually //yogīs,// they meditate upon the //viṣṇu-mūrti// within the heart. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. //Yogīs,// their meditation, Viṣṇu.

So this //kṛṣṇa-praśna,// Kṛṣṇa question and Kṛṣṇa answer, this is //loka-hitam.// Anyone hears... In another place //Śrī Bhāgavata// says, //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]: "About Kṛṣṇa, if you hear and speak, it is automatically //puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.//" As it is said, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. So this //śravaṇam// Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, means //puṇya, puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.// Even if you do not understand anything, if you simply sit down silently and give aural reception to the sound vibration of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// you become purified. //Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ. Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. Simply by hearing, you become pious. Because we are all impious. Unless we are impious, we don't accept this material body. There may be difference of degrees. That does not make... Anyone who has come to this material world, he is to be considered as impious.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Because all of us are now in this material body means there is //pāpa.// Otherwise why there is... Just like in the prison house, anyone, he may be Gandhi or he may be a small pickpocket, anyone who is in the prison house, it is to be considered that he is criminal. He is a criminal in the eyes of the government. We may worship Gandhi, that's all right, or any political leader, but government think that he is a criminal. Similarly, we have to accept the government's decision. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa's decision. Kṛṣṇa's decision is that anyone who is in this material world, beginning from Brahmā down to the small ant, some way or other, they are criminal.

> kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare
> pāśate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare
> [Prema-vivarta 6.2]

The //māyā's// business is to capture. Just like criminal is arrested by the police, similarly, //māyā// is also engaged for this purpose. Anyone who forgets Kṛṣṇa, anyone who wants to enjoy, enjoy life, imitate like Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer. //Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. He is the enjoyer. But we are imitating. Sometimes we say, "I am Kṛṣṇa. I am God." This is our disease. We want to imitate Kṛṣṇa. We want to become Kṛṣṇa. We want to enjoy like Kṛṣṇa. This is going on. So, so long we have got this propensity, we are sinful. This is the substance.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyaḥ:// "If you surrender unto Me... Because you have rebelled against Me. Rebelling against Me, you have come to this material world to enjoy. So I have given you all chances. I have given you chance to become Brahmā, to become Indra or become Candra, to become Nixon, to become Gandhi, to become Jawaharlal Nehru, to become ant, to become cat, to become dog. I have given you all chances, and you have enjoyed. But you are not satisfied. Now, if you have got sense, just surrender to Me."

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

"If you actually want real happiness, then you surrender to Me. I will give you protection from this sinful reaction of life."

So those who are very grossly sinful, their business is in sleeping. //Nidrayā hriyate naktam//---to sleep at night or to indulge sex life.

**Pradyumna:**
//Vyavāyena.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ. Vyavāya// means sex life. So //vyavāyena ca vā vayaḥ.// The //vayaḥ... Vayaḥ// means duration of life. The more you indulge in sex life, your duration of life is reduced. That is the scientific method. Therefore the //yogīs,// they give up sex life. It is a very great science, the breathing. During sex life there is more breathing. So the more you misuse your breathing, your duration of life is reduced. And if you can preserve this breathing, then you can increase your duration of life. Why people are dying nowadays, fifty years, sixty years, seventy years? No. One should live for at least hundred years. But because they unduly indulge in sex life, they die early. Their duration of life is reduced.

So these people, //apaśyatām ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]], those who are ignorant of the //ātma-tattvam,// they indulge in //nidrayā hriyate naktaṁ vyavāyena ca vā.// This is their night's business. And day's business... What is the day's business? //Divā cārthehayā rājan.// During daytime, "Where is money? Where is money? Where is money? Where is money? Where is money? Go here, go there, go there, go..." All right, take money. Then "How to utilize it?" Now, //kuṭumba-bharaṇena vā.// "Then go to the shop.

Purchase this thing for my wife, for my children, for this, for that." So money earned and spent, and night, sleeping and mating. Then where is your time for cultivating Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Huh? This is the position. //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. Those who are blind, who do not know what is the value of this life, this human form of life, they are busy in these things. //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam.//

But actually, this life is meant for understanding //ātma-tattvam. Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// This life is not meant for like cats and dogs---eating, sleeping, mating and defending. This is all cats' and dogs' business. Therefore those who are engaged only in these business:

> yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke
> sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

//Go-khara. Go-khara// means... //Go// means cow, and //khara// means ass. Those who are acting on this bodily concept of life, they are no better than cows and asses. Therefore one who is inquisitive about //ātma-tattva,// one who is inquisitive about Kṛṣṇa and such //praśna,// such inquiries as Parīkṣit Mahārāja did before Śukadeva Gosvāmī... He welcomed it immediately. //Varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:1|[SB 2.1.1]]]: "Oh, you have questioned very nicely about Kṛṣṇa." //Loka-hitaṁ nṛpa:// "Oh, it is not only good for you; it is good for all the people of the world."

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not a sectarian movement. It is good for all human being, because as soon as there is question of Kṛṣṇa, people will hear. Actually, it is happening all over the world. Especially the younger generation, why they are taking interest? Because //loka-hitam.// They are understanding that it is beneficial. Every student, every disciple, they write me letter how much they are feeling grateful, that "We have got something. Prabhupāda, you have given us something." Of course, I have not given. It is not my property. I have simply informed them, "Here is Kṛṣṇa, and the life's business is to become a devotee." Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. This is your business.

So anyone who becomes engaged in this //loka-hitam,// beneficial to the human society, he will be happy. But he has to control over these things: //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca.// These animal propensities should be controlled. Then it will be impetus. It will give acceleration to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore we have got the restriction: no illicit sex life, no gambling, no meat-eating, no intoxication. If we can control, if you follow these regulative principles and regularly chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// gradually you'll realize everything. //Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam// [Śikṣāṣṭaka 1].

So this is the actually understanding of //Bhāgavatam.// We are speaking on the Second Canto. So //Bhāgavatam// should not be finished... Now they have become, made a business, finish within seven days, //Bhāgavata-saptāha.// So what they will understand //Bhāgavata?// One //śloka,// you cannot understand in seven months. One //śloka, janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. What you will understand? This has become a business. The //Bhāgavata// never says that "You hear for seven days." Never says it. We have read. There is no mention in the //Bhāgavata// that //Bhāgavata// should be heard for seven days. No commentator. There are many, many big commentators--- Śrīdhara Svāmī, Jīva Gosvāmī and Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Vīrarāghavācārya, Madhvācārya, so many big, big. There are... Nobody has mentioned about //Bhāgavata-saptāha.// And in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, //nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. //Nityam:// "daily." What you will understand? What is your merit that you will understand?

So everything has become professional. So therefore people are in darkness. One should be very serious, serious to understand the teachings of //Bhāgavatam.// Then he will actually make profit and make a successful life. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.// This... //Nityābhiyuktānām. Nityābhiyuktānām.// This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for engaging the people twenty-four hours in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Twenty-four hours. Not that partial: "Twenty-three hours and sixty minutes I will spoil myself in this //nidrayā hriyate naktam,// and for fifteen minutes I make some Kṛṣṇa consciousness." No, not like that. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.//

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

//Sadā// means twenty-four hours. You should have to mold your life in such a way that twenty-four hours you will be thinking of Kṛṣṇa. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ// [[books:bg:9:34|[Bg. 9.34]]]. That will make your life perfect.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
