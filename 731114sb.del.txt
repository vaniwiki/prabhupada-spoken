What is the aim of life? This is described here, //dharmasya hi āpavargyasya.// The human life begins when he accepts religion. That is the beginning of human life, and that is the difference between human life and dog's life. The dog is engaged always for eating, sleeping, sex life and defending. The hog also engaged always searching after where is food. Although the food is stool, he is busy. And as soon as the body is little strong by eating stool, immediately sex life, without any distinction whether it is mother or sister or daughter, it doesn't matter. This is hog's life, by nature's example.

Therefore //śāstra// says that //ayaṁ deha.//

> nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke
> kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye
> [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]

This human form of life, //deha-bhājām...// The cats and dogs and hogs, they have also accepted a body. And the trees, the plants, the insects, the birds, beasts---everyone has got body, material body. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. I have explained it. According to the infection of the modes of material nature, one is getting a type of body, nature's way. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi.// The same example: if you contaminate some disease, you'll have to suffer or you'll have to accept that disease. So similarly, this is the nature's way. If you are associating with a certain type of quality of the material nature, you are preparing your body for that purpose.

> prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
> guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
> ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
> kartāham iti manyate
> [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]

We are very much proud of our body: "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am prime minister," "I am this," "I am that." The dog is also very much proud: "I am greyhound," "I am this bulldog," "I am this." Yes. Everyone is proud, however nasty body he may live. The hog is also very proud. Although he is eating stool and living in a very filthy place, but if you want to drag him from that place, he will, "//Che-che-che.// No, no, I don't want... I am very happy here." There is a story in the //Bhāgavata// that once Brahmā was cursed and he become a hog in this world. No, Indra; I am sorry. Because Indra was very offending, so he was cursed. He became a hog. So Brahmā thought that "In the absence of Indra the kingdom of heaven is not managed very nicely, so let me go and bring him again, excuse." So when he came, he asked the hog that "Come with me." "Where?" "To the heaven." "Oh, I cannot go. I have got my responsibility. I have got my responsibility. I cannot go."

So this is the position. Everyone is very happy. This is called //māyā's// influence. Unless a hog feels happy, how he can live in this abominable life? This is called //prakṣepātmika-śakti:// covering. If one man knows or..., that "I was king in my previous life. Now I have become a poor cobbler," or something like, then he will become mad. So therefore he forgets. Death means forget. Because the living entity does not die. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. There is no death. Death means forgetting everything of my past life. That's all. Just like we forget... At night, when we dream, we accept another body, and we forget this body. And in the daytime we forget the night dream body and accept this body. We have got daily experience. So death means forgetting the past life. Otherwise, there was past life. That's a fact. But as we forget daily night body in the daytime and day body at nighttime, so similarly, we are changing our body according to the infection of the quality of material nature, and we are entangled in this material world. Although we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, God, or we are sons of God, but unfortunately, we have come in contact of this material world, and making our different types of body by the contamination of the material modes of nature. This is going on.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa comes. Kṛṣṇa is the father of everyone. He canvasses, "My dear children, why you are rotting in this material world? Come back."

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi...
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

This is the message of //Bhagavad-gītā.// So //dharma// means to understand my relationship with God. That is //dharma. Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. Just like a good citizen means who knows the relationship with the state. That is good citizenship. Bad citizenship means who doesn't care for the state. That is bad citizen, criminal. They are put into the prison house. So similarly, the living entities, they are part and parcel of God. But when they are not ready or prepared to abide by the laws of God, they are put into this material world. Beginning from Brahmā, //ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]], they are rotating in this way. So //dharma// means to abide by the laws of God, just like good citizen means to abide by the state laws. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]].

So here it is said, //dharmasya hy āpavargyasya// [[books:sb:1:2:9|[SB 1.2.9]]]. //Apavarga// and //pavarga.// This material life is //pavarga. Pa-varga// means---those who are acquainted with grammar---there are //vargas: ka-varga, kha-varga, ca-varga, ta-varga.// Similarly //pa-varga. Pa-varga// means //pa, pha, ba, bha, ma,// five. So //pa// represents //pariśrama,// labor, hard labor. This material world, you have to work. Either you are human being or a hog or dog or cat, it doesn't matter; you have to work. And very severe work, so that foam will come within your mouth. //Pha.// Then //pa, pha, ba. Ba// means //vyarthatā,// baffledness. And //bha// means //bhaya,// always fearful, "What will happen next? What will happen next?" And in this way, //ma---mṛtyu, maraṇa.// This is called material life. There is no more gain, simply //pa, pha, ba, bha, ma.// That's all. This is material life. And //apavarga// means just the opposite: to nullify this //pavarga// business.

So here it is said, //dharmasya hi āpavargyasya.// Religion means how to get out of these //pavargas.// That is //dharma. Bhāgavata// says, //dharmasya hy āpavargyasya na arthaḥ arthāya upakalpate.// Generally, people go to church, to temple, for some material benefit. Therefore //śāstra// says, "No, no. //Dharma// is not meant for that purpose." People have become materialistic more and more because, just like in our country, "If you want economic development, then why you should go to temple?" The Communist theory is also like that, that "If you want material happiness, why you are going to church and accepting, 'O God, give us our daily bread'? The bread, you manufacture. You just work for it." In one side, it is good. But this is also fact, that without God's mercy, you cannot get even bread. Although bread you can manufacture, but the ingredients of the bread, the wheat, that is not in your hand. You cannot manufacture in the factory.

That is in the hand of //prakṛti,// nature, and //prakṛti// is working under the control of the Supreme Lord. It is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. So it is the //prakṛti's// business to control food supply when people become godless. That is //prakṛti's// business. Because //prakṛti...// These statements are there in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the story of Mahārāja Pṛthu. So //prakṛti// said that "Because people have become godless, demons, I have restricted my supply." Therefore everything depends on the mercy of the Lord.

So therefore //dharma// means to abide by the laws of God---that is //dharma//---so that you can get our of the entanglement of this //pavarga. Dharmasya hy āpavarga na artha upakalpate.// Not for economic development. Don't go to the church, don't go to the temple for your economic development. Although in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //ārtaḥ arthārthī jñānī jijñāsuḥ, catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:7:16|[Bg. 7.16]]]: "Four kinds of men---those who are //ārta,// distressed, //arthārthī,// in need of money---they come to Me." That is also good. But that is not the meaning of //dharma. Dharmasya hy āpavargyasya.// You have to execute religious system only to get out of the entanglement of this //pavarga.// That is the purpose. //Dharmasya hy āpavargyasya nārthaḥ arthāya upakalpate.// Not for economic development.

In our Vedic literature you will never find these things, that economic development. Of course, the economic development, in the //śāstra// there are, in the Vedic literature, to sacrifice. //Yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. //Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. That is there. But that is not the purpose. Real purpose is how to get out of the entanglement of //pavarga. Dharmasya hy āpavargyasya na arthāya upakalpate.// Then you can say, "We require some money." Yes. You require money. That's all right. Economic development, there is need. So therefore it is said, //na arthasya dharma ekāntasya kāmo lābhāya hi smṛtaḥ,// that you require money. Because you have got this body, you have got to gratify your senses. That is right. But not for sense gratification, only for sense gratification. No. //Dharmasya na arthasya, arthasya.// The money which you get, that is not meant for sense gratification. //Dharmaikāntasya.// Actually who is religious, who is interested in religion, for him, this economic development, getting money, is not meant for sense gratification. //Nārthasya dharmaikāntasya kāmo lābhāya hi smṛtaḥ.//

But we have got demands of our body. What to do? //Kāmo lābhāya.// The //kāma// is there, demands of the senses. So therefore it is said, //kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ.// You can get the supply of the necessities of your senses as much as you require. That is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā: yuktāhāra-vihārasya yogo bhavati siddhiḥ// [[books:bg:6:17|[Bg. 6.17]]]. //Yuktāhāra.// You should eat what is actually needed by you. Don't eat more. A human being, there is... Certainly we are eating. But we are eating... A Kṛṣṇa conscious person eats //kṛṣṇa-prasādam. Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. Our business is to eat... We don't say that you are vegetarian and nonvegetarian. Vegetarian or nonvegetarian, it does not make very much difference. //Ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpāḥ// [[books:bg:3:13|[Bg. 3.13]]]. If you eat only for yourself, for sense gratification, it doesn't matter whether you are vegetarian or nonvegetarian; you are simply eating sinful results of your life. //Ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt// [[books:bg:3:13|[Bg. 3.13]]]. //Yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]].

So our business is, so far we are concerned, Kṛṣṇa conscious people, we are not advocates of vegetarian and nonvegetarian. Of course, vegetarianism is very good, even for health's sake. But we do not take vegetables even, if it is not offered to Kṛṣṇa. That is our principle. If Kṛṣṇa said that "You give Me nonvegetarian diet," then we can eat also. But Kṛṣṇa does not say. Kṛṣṇa says, //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. So we are preparing so many nice foodstuff with this //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam.// We can prepare many, many hundreds of preparation of this //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam,// and we can offer Kṛṣṇa and then take //prasādam.// That is all right. The human life is not meant for sense gratification. Sense gratification---my food is Kṛṣṇa //prasādam.// Why shall I go to restaurant? And this is //tapasya.// Eating is not stopped, but don't eat anything which is not //kṛṣṇa-prasādam.// That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you, for satisfaction of your tongue, you get money and satisfy your tongue, that is forbidden. It is said that //kāmasya na indriya-prītiḥ.// You have demand. You have to..., demand of the body. You have to eat something. You have to sleep somewhere. You must have some sense gratification. You must protect yourself from attack of others. That is all right. But don't do all these things for sense gratification. This is the injunction of the //śāstra.//

Just like Arjuna fought. Arjuna fought not for sense gratification. He fought for satisfying Kṛṣṇa. Because Arjuna, first of all, he was trying to satisfy his senses. He said to Kṛṣṇa, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, they are all my relatives. The other side: my grandfather, my brothers, my nephews, my son-in-laws. Oh, how can I fight with them?" This consideration was for sense gratification. He was thinking that "In this way I shall be satisfied." Personally. But there was no question of satisfying Kṛṣṇa. But when he understood that his business was to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, then he agreed. Kṛṣṇa inquired, "Whether you have now decided to fight or not?" He said, "Yes." //Naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtir labdhā:// "I have now got back my memory, and my //moha,// illusion, is now lost." //Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]: "I shall fight." So this fighting was service to Kṛṣṇa. It is not sense gratification. Rather, when he was trying to become nonviolent, very good man, not to fight, sacrifice for the other party, that was sense gratification.

This is the distinction between //bhakti// and //karma. Karma// is sense gratification, and //bhakti// is satisfying the Lord. The same thing. Therefore people cannot understand what is the difference between a //bhakta// and a //karmī. Karmī// is satisfying his own senses, and the //bhakta// is satisfying Kṛṣṇa's senses. There must be some sense gratification. But when you satisfy Kṛṣṇa, that is called //bhakti. Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Hṛṣīka// means senses, purified senses. That I explained the other day that,

> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

//Bhakti// does not mean stop your work. //Bhakti// does not mean sentimental fanaticism. That is not //bhakti. Bhakti// means to engage all your senses for the satisfaction of the proprietor of the senses. That is called //bhakti.//

Therefore Kṛṣṇa's name is Hṛṣīkeśa. //Hṛṣīka// means senses, and //hṛṣīka īśa,// He is the controller of the senses. Actually, our senses are working not independently. We can understand it. Kṛṣṇa is directing. //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca.// A scientist is working because Kṛṣṇa is helping him, not that he is independently working. That is not possible. But he wanted in that way. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is giving him facilities. But actually, Kṛṣṇa is working. These are explained in the //Upaniṣad.// Without Kṛṣṇa working, without seeing..., without Kṛṣṇa's seeing, you cannot see. Just like the sunshine is explained in the //Brahma-saṁhitā, yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ.// The sun is one of the eyes of Kṛṣṇa.

> yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ
> rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ
> yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.52]

Therefore, sun being the one of the eyes of Kṛṣṇa, because the sun rises there, because sun is seeing, therefore you are seeing. You cannot see independently. You are so much proud of your eyes. What is the value of your eyes if there is no sunrise? You cannot see. Even this electricity, that is derived from sun. So actually when Kṛṣṇa sees, you can see. That is the position.

So our senses... In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādaṁ tat// [[books:bg:13:14|[Bg. 13.14]]]. //Sarvataḥ pāṇi-pāda...// Everywhere Kṛṣṇa has His hands and legs. What are that? My hands, your hand, your leg---that is Kṛṣṇa's. Just like if somebody says I have got branches all over the world. So those branches are working on the management of the supreme person. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa also. Kṛṣṇa is therefore called Hṛṣīkeśa. Hṛṣīkeśa. So business is... //Bhakti// means when we engage our //hṛṣīka,// our //indriyas,// our senses, in the service of the proprietor of the senses, that is our perfect life. That is our perfect... But as soon as we desire to use our senses for the gratification of the senses, that is called //karma.// That is called material life.

So therefore, for a //bhakta// there is nothing material. That is //īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. The //bhakta// sees that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ yat kiñca jagatyāṁ jagat, tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā.// Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore whatever Kṛṣṇa gives us... Just like a master. Master allots something to the servant: "You can enjoy this." That //prasādam. Prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hānir asyopajā...// [[books:bg:2:65|[Bg. 2.65]]]. This is the life. If you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, if you understand that "Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, even my hands and legs, they also belong to Kṛṣṇa. All the parts of my body, they belong to Kṛṣṇa; then it should be used for Kṛṣṇa," that is called //bhakti.//

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

That Kṛṣṇa did, er, Arjuna did. He wanted to satisfy his senses by not fighting, but he agreed, after hearing //Bhagavad-gītā,// that "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person."

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]

These things are very nicely explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is the preliminary study of spiritual life. And if we are actually convinced of the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā,// then we surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wants that. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. That He wants. When we actually take to this process, this is called //śraddhā. Śraddhā.// That has been explained by Kavirāja Gosvāmī, what is the meaning of //śraddhā://

> śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya
> kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]]

This is called //śraddhā. Śraddhā// means firm faith. What is that firm faith? Firm faith means that... Kṛṣṇa says that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam.// When you take this conclusion, "Yes, by surrender to Kṛṣṇa, by surrendering unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, everything is done very nicely," this is called //śraddhā.// And the more you increase this //śraddhā,// the more you become perfect.

This is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, beginning with this //śraddhā. Ādau śraddhā.// If you don't believe... You are reading //Bhagavad-gītā// three hundred years but don't believe that "I have to surrender to Kṛṣṇa," then what is the use of reading //Bhagavad-gītā?// All these rascals, they are reading //Bhagavad-gītā// but they have no concern with Kṛṣṇa, forget Kṛṣṇa. This is reading of //Bhagavad-gītā//---useless waste of time. Useless waste of time. If you do not understand the meaning of //Bhagavad-gītā,// why you are...? //Śrama eva hi kevalam.// That has been explained in the previous verse.

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed ratiṁ yadi 
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

If you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, if you do not surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then you are simply wasting your time. There is no meaning of writing big, big comments on //Bhagavad-gītā,// uselessly waste your time and waste others' time. This is the real problem: //śraddhā.// Kṛṣṇa said, by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa everything will be done. //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.// So if one has no //śraddhā,// faith, on this instruction of Kṛṣṇa, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], then there is no use; simply waste of time.

If we come to this point, //ādau śraddhā...// This is called //śraddhā.// Then the next stage is //ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]. If one has..., one is convinced that "Surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, my all business will be perfect," this is called //śraddhā.// Then we have to seek out who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]]. //Sādhu// means Kṛṣṇa conscious person. //Sādhu// does not mean having a big beard and nice dress or saffron-colored dress. That is not //sādhu. Sādhu// is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā, api cet su-durācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. That is //sādhu,// who has no other business than to serve Kṛṣṇa. He is //sādhu.//

He is //sādhu// because he has accepted the principle, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. //Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ samyag vyavasito hi saḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. You cannot say, "Oh, he has got some bad principle in his life. Although he is worshiping Kṛṣṇa wholeheartedly, but he has got some defect." Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //api cet su-durācāraḥ.// Even if he has got so many defects of his life, because he has dedicated his life for Kṛṣṇa's service, //sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ.// So if you have got //śraddhā// that by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa your all purpose of life will be practical or fruitful, then you have to associate with such persons who are engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, //sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]]. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ.//

Therefore our this movement is called International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. So actually, one by one, as people are coming to the association of Societies, automatically he is becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is practical. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ.// This is //sādhu-saṅga. Sādhu-saṅga// does not mean to associate with some saffron-colored men. //Sādhu-saṅga// means to associate with Kṛṣṇa conscious person. This is //śāstra. Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu...// This is Rūpa Gosvāmī's direction, that if you want to develop your love for Kṛṣṇa, this is the process.

Because real purpose of life is not //dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa// ([[books:sb:4:8:41|SB 4.8.41]], [[books:cc:adi:1:90|Cc. Ādi 1.90]]). And that will be explained here, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā:// What is the Absolute Truth; what is the aim of life. Then this is the process. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā.// Practically we have seen. These boys and girls, Europe and America, they first of all came to me, and they associated, abided by my orders. Then automatically they wanted to be initiated. We are doing that. Every day we are initiating some new devotees. So this is called //bhajana-kriyā.// You'll be automatically anxious. If one associates with //sādhu,// then he will be automatically anxious to accept //bhajana-kriyā,// initiation, that you have to rise early in the morning, you have to offer //maṅgala-ārati,// you have to do this, you have to do that. Twenty-four-hours' program is there. That is called //bhajana-kriyā.//

//Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā tato 'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]. //Anartha// means useless habits. Just like one smokes. It is useless habit. By bad association one becomes a smoker, one becomes a drunkard, one becomes a meat-eater, one becomes a gambler. These are //anarthas.// So everyone in this age, everyone is associated with these //anarthas.// But if he takes to //kṛṣṇa-bhajana, bhajana-kriyā,// then //anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.// Practically you can see. These boys and girls, they are no more meat-eaters, they are no more taking any intoxicants, they are no more gambler, no more illicit-sex hunters. No. Everything stopped. This is our prin... This is called //mukti.// This is called //mukti.// As soon as you get rid of these bad sinful activities, you are //mukta.// That is called //mukti.// And after //mukti, tato niṣṭhā,// then we have got firm conviction: "Yes, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only business." //Tato niṣṭhā, tato ruciḥ.// Then you increase your taste. //Tato niṣṭhā athāsaktiḥ.// Then you become attached to Kṛṣṇa.

That is the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //bhakti-yoga.// This is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā: mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// When you increase your attachment for Kṛṣṇa... That is required. Increase... You have got attachment for your family, for your body, for your society, for your country---everything. That's all right. But you have to convert them. You have to increase attachment for Kṛṣṇa. That is called //bhakti-yoga.//

Kṛṣṇa says in the Seventh Chapter, in the beginning.

So everything is there. If we actually want to make our life perfect, the directions are already there in our... We have got the Vedic knowledge, treasure house of spiritual knowledge, and the //Bhagavad-gītā// is the gist, is the summary. //Gītopaniṣad.// It is called //Upaniṣad.// If you simply study //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, without foolishly interpreting it... That will spoil. Don't interpret. Just like you have given //paramānna,// or //kṣīra.// Everyone knows what is //kṣīra,// milk and rice cooked together with sugar, very nice foodstuff. But if you add with it several grains of sand, it becomes useless. You can add it, simply a few grains of sand---then it is useless. Similarly, these rascaldom of commentary, a few grains of sand, we spoil //Bhagavad-gītā.//

Therefore Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmī has advised how to save yourself from this rascaldom. He says, //avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam, śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyam// [Padma Purāṇa]. //Pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtam. Hari-kathā.// Kṛṣṇa is speaking //Bhagavad-gītā;// therefore it is called //hari-kathā, kṛṣṇa-kathā.// So Sanātana Gosvāmī says, "If it is uttered by //avaiṣṇava//---who is not a devotee, he is a professional man, so-called scholar and politician---don't hear it. Don't hear it." //Avaiṣṇava:// "Because he is not a Vaiṣṇava." //Avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ pūtaṁ hari-kathā. Hari-kathā// means Kṛṣṇa's words. They are very purified. That's all right. But no, //śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyam.// Why? Because //sarpocchiṣṭaṁ yathā payaḥ.// Just like milk. Milk is very good food, but if it is touched by the tongue of a serpent, it becomes poison. If you eat that kind of milk, your life will be finished. Similarly, our only request is that don't try to read //Bhagavad-gītā// commented by unauthorized so-called scholars or politicians. Simply read //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. Simply accept what Kṛṣṇa says. Then you will be benefited.

Kṛṣṇa says, //dharma-kṣetra.// Not Kṛṣṇa says; //sañjaya uvāca. Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre...// No. //Dhṛtarāṣṭra uvāca.// Dhṛtrāṣṭra says,

> dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre
> samavetā yuyutsavaḥ
> māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva
> kim akurvata sañjaya
> [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]

He is asking his secretary. He was blind man, so he was asking his secretary, "My dear Sañjaya, after my boys, //māmakāḥ,// and //pāṇḍavāḥ,// the sons of my younger brother Pāṇḍu, //samavetā yuyutsavaḥ,// they assembled for fighting in the //dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre...//" //Dharma..., kuru-kṣetra// is still there. Everyone knows. And it is //dharma-kṣetra.// Everyone knows. Then where is the difficulty to understand //dharma-kṣetra kuru-kṣetra māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāḥ?// But if you foolishly interpret, "//Dharma-kṣetra// means this, and //kuru-kṣetra// means that, and //pāṇḍavāḥ// means that," you spoil the whole thing. That is going on. Otherwise there is no difficulty. //Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]].

Actually, it is historical fact, //Mahābhārata.// There was fight between two cousin-brothers. They, "No. //Pāṇḍava// means this and this. //Kuru-kṣetra// means this and... This means this." In this way, things are being spoiled. So we are misled in that way. Actually if we read //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, as a devotee... Because without being a devotee, nobody can understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// Because in the //Bhagavad-gītā// in so many places it is stated, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. //Bhaktyā,// only through devotion, only becoming a devotee, you can understand Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise you cannot. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]: "I am not exposed to anyone." //Yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ.// "Only //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]."

So this is the way. And this life is meant for that purpose. That is the advice of the //Vedas. Vedaiś ca sarvaiḥ...// [break] So Arjuna is inquiring from Kṛṣṇa, and He says, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. So //Bhagavad-gītā// is real //Vedānta.// And if one understands //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, he is really Vedāntist. //Veda// means knowledge, and //anta// means the last word. So last word of knowledge is Kṛṣṇa. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. If one does not understand Kṛṣṇa and does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa, he is simply uselessly wasting his time. That is the verdict of all Vedic literature.

Therefore in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata// it is said, //kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ. Kāmasya nendriya-prītir lābho jīveta yāvatā// [[books:sb:1:2:10|[SB 1.2.10]]]. Simply take so much as you will need, not for sense gratification. That is the process. Don't take more, don't take less. //Yuktāhāra-vihārasya// [[books:bg:6:17|[Bg. 6.17]]]. //Śāstra// does not advise you that you starve, unnecessarily you starve. No. Kṛṣṇa has condemned one who unnecessarily starves. You take foodstuff, but don't take anything which is forbidden. Take //kṛṣṇa-prasādam. Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. Don't try to satisfy your senses. The senses will be satisfied. There are so many varieties of food, //kṛṣṇa-prasādam.// That you will... These Europeans and Americans, they used to take meat. Now if you give them, bribe, that "You take again meat..." Because they have learned to cook so many nice foodstuff. Ask any one of them. //Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā. Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā.// When you get better thing, //nivartate,// then you give up which is not very good.

So this //bhakti-yoga,// Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is so nice that if you take it very seriously, if you enter into the mystery of this //bhakti-yoga//---it is not all mystery, it is very open---then naturally, //paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 2.59]]]. And that is required. //Vairāgya.//

> vāsudeve bhagavati
> bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ

> jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam

We have discussed this verse. So our only request is that don't take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement as some sentimental religious propaganda. No, no. It is not religious; it is scientific. It is to save the human society from gliding down to the abominable condition. //Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]], //Bhāgavata// says. //Adanta-gobhiḥ. Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. //Adānta.// The verse is, //matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā. Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām.// Those who are //gṛha-vrata,// means simply materialistic or simply this life, this body, "I am this body, and the offsprings of this body, they are my kinsmen. I have to maintain them," or expanding: "They are my kinsmen, they are my family men, they are my nation," this is called //gṛhamedhi.// So such //gṛhamedhi, matir na kṛṣṇe,// they cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

//Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā. Parataḥ// means by instruction of superior person. //Parataḥ. Svataḥ,// by reading himself. //Mitho 'bhipadyeta,// or holding big, big meeting. They cannot understand. Why? Because //gṛha-vrata. Gṛha-vratānām.// What is the business of //gṛha-vrata? Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām.// By being unable to control the senses, creating another body, another body, the sense gratification, either as god or demigod or as dog or as hog or as human being, as tree or insect, the business is //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. //Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]. //Punaḥ punaḥ.// The same thing he is doing. He does not know the real business is how to get out of this entanglement of //pavarga,// repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. He does not know. There is no science, there is no education.

There is only education in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Therefore you have to, if you want to save the world, if you want to save the human civilization, you have to take to this proposition of //Bhagavad-gītā,// learn it scientifically and make your life successful.

Thank you very much. [end]
