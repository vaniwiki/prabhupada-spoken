[chants responsively with devotees]

> sa bahyābhyantara-śuciḥ
> [Garuḍa Purāṇa]

**Prabhupāda:**
So your spiritual name is Taittireyā. [indistinct] Taittireyā. //Taittireya Upaniṣad.// One who know the //Taittireya Upaniṣad.// Chant sixteen rounds at least.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

> parama koruṇa, pahū dui jana
> nitāi gauracandra
> saba avatāra-sāra śiromaṇi
> kevala ānanda-kanda
> [from Dhāmāli]

Locana dāsa Ṭhākura, he sings that "This Nitāi-Gaura incarnation, //parama karuṇa//---very, very merciful." //Parama koruṇa, pahū dui jana:// "Two Lords, Nitāi-Gaura." //Parama koruṇa, pahū dui jana. Dui jana// means two. //Parama koruṇa, pahū dui jana, nitāi gauracandra:// "Nityānanda and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or Gaura Hari." //Saba avatāra, sāra śiromaṇi kevala ānanda-kanda:// "There are many incarnation, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda---simply //ānanda,// bliss." //Ānanda,// bliss, //kevala ānanda-kanda.//

Now, for spiritual advancement, generally according to the Vedic system, so one has to accept the order of renounced life. Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally taught it, but He never condemned //gṛhastha// life, householder life. He rather said,

> kibā vipra kibā śūdra nyāsī kena naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]

One may be a //gṛhastha// or //sannyāsī//---it doesn't matter---but he must be //kṛṣṇa-tattva-vit.// He must know the science of Kṛṣṇa. That is required. So in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we have got four orders: //brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.// Whichever position one can find himself suitable, he can accept that, and... But the main business is //kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā,// and preach the cult all over the world, //sei guru haya. Guru// means preacher, to enlighten. One who can enlighten, he is //guru.//

> ajñāna-timirāndhasya
> jñānāñjana-śalākayā
> cakṣur-unmīlitaṁ yena
> tasmai śrī-gurave namaḥ
> [Gautamīya-tantra]

//Guru// means one who can open the eyes of the ignorant by the light of knowledge. He is //guru.//

So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is all-round movement. All-round movement. Just like Kṛṣṇa, He took part in everything. Not that Kṛṣṇa simply was interested in Vedic ritualistic ceremony. Of course, everything is based on Vedic ritualistic ceremony. But Kṛṣṇa also took part in everything. He was a politician, He was a philosopher, He was a socialist, He was a communist---everything. That is Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa.

So we recommend that in whatever position you feel comfortable, you can accept that, but, I mean to say, spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. //Parama ānanda-khanda.// People will be happy. Our mission is to see //sarve sukhino bhavantu:// everyone become happy. We don't want to see that we exploit somebody else and I become happy. No. We want to see everyone happy. But they do not know how to become happy. Therefore we are trying to spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement that everyone will be happy.

//Su-sukhaṁ kartum avyayam// [[books:bg:9:2|[Bg. 9.2]]]. In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is... //Su-sukham.// To execute this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very easy. //Kartum avyayam:// and whatever you perform, it is permanent. //Avyayam// and //su-sukham,// very pleasing. There is nothing very painful in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Because Kṛṣṇa is //ānanda, ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12], we are going under the protection of Kṛṣṇa, there must be always //ānanda.// But people do not know how to enjoy //ānanda.// They have been put into ignorance. The so-called leaders, so-called politicians, so-called philosophers, scientists, they are simply keeping the people in darkness.

So we want to counteract this action of keeping people in darkness. //Lokasya ajānataḥ vidvān cakre sātvata-saṁhitām.// Vyāsadeva compiled this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...//

> anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād
> bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje
> lokasya ajānataḥ vidvān
> cakre sātvata-saṁhitām
> [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]

So people do not know it. So we are trying to spread this knowledge, that how to become happy. So everyone should come forward and cooperate with this movement.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya. Haribol.// [end]
