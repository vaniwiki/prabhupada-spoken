===== Chapter 7: Lord Caitanya in Five Features =====

/* TEXT 1 */
> agaty-eka-gatiṁ natvā
> hīnārthādhika-sādhakam
> śrī-caitanyaṁ likhyate ’sya
> prema-bhakti-vadānyatā

Let me first offer my respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the ultimate goal of life for one bereft of all possessions in this material world and is the only meaning for one advancing in spiritual life. Thus let me write about His magnanimous contribution of devotional service in love of God.

/* TEXT 2 */
> jaya jaya mahāprabhu śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya
> tāṅhāra caraṇāśrita, sei baḍa dhanya

Let me offer glorification to the Supreme Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One who has taken shelter of His lotus feet is the most glorified person.

/* TEXT 3 */
> pūrve gurv-ādi chaya tattve kaila namaskāra
> guru-tattva kahiyāchi, ebe pāṅcera vicāra

In the beginning I have discussed the truth about the spiritual master. Now I shall try to explain the Pañca-tattva.

/* TEXT 4 */
> pañca-tattva avatīrṇa caitanyera saṅge
> pañca-tattva lañā karena saṅkīrtana raṅge

These five tattvas incarnate with Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and thus the Lord executes His saṅkīrtana movement with great pleasure.

/* TEXT 5 */
> pañca-tattva---eka-vastu, nāhi kichu bheda
> rasa āsvādite tabu vividha vibheda

Spiritually there are no differences between these five tattvas, for on the transcendental platform everything is absolute. Yet there are also varieties in the spiritual world, and in order to taste these spiritual varieties one should distinguish between them.

/* TEXT 6 */
> pañca-tattvātmakaṁ kṛṣṇaṁ
> bhakta-rūpa-svarūpakam
> bhaktāvatāraṁ bhaktākhyaṁ
> namāmi bhakta-śaktikam

Let me offer my obeisances unto Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who has manifested Himself in five as a devotee, expansion of a devotee, incarnation of a devotee, pure devotee and devotional energy.

/* TEXT 7 */
> svayaṁ bhagavān kṛṣṇa ekale īśvara
> advitīya, nandātmaja, rasika-śekhara

SKṛṣṇa, the reservoir of all pleasure, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, the supreme controller. No one is greater than or equal to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, yet He appears as the son of Mahārāja Nanda.

/* TEXT 8 */
> rāsādi-vilāsī, vrajalalanā-nāgara
> āra yata saba dekha,---tāṅra parikara

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the supreme enjoyer in the rāsa dance. He is the leader of the damsels of Vraja, and all others are simply His associates.

/* TEXT 9 */
> sei kṛṣṇa avatīrṇa śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya
> sei parikara-gaṇa saṅge saba dhanya

The selfsame Lord Kṛṣṇa advented Himself as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu with all His eternal associates, who are also equally glorious.

/* TEXT 10 */
> ekale īśvara-tattva caitanya-īśvara
> bhakta-bhāvamaya tāṅra śuddha kalevara

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the supreme controller, the one Personality of Godhead, has ecstatically become a devotee, yet His body is transcendental and not materially tinged.

/* TEXT 11 */
> kṛṣṇa-mādhuryera eka adbhuta svabhāva
> āpanā āsvādite kṛṣṇa kare bhakta-bhāva

The transcendental mellow of conjugal love of Kṛṣṇa is so wonderful that Kṛṣṇa Himself accepts the form of a devotee to relish and taste it fully.

/* TEXT 12 */
> ithe bhakta-bhāva dhare caitanya gosāñi
> ‘bhakta-svarūpa’ tāṅra nityānanda-bhāi

For this reason Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the supreme teacher, accepts the form of a devotee and accepts Lord Nityānanda as His elder brother.

/* TEXT 13 */
> ‘bhakta-avatāra’ tāṅra ācārya-gosāñi
> ei tina tattva sabe prabhu kari’ gāi

Śrī Advaita Ācārya is Lord Caitanya’s incarnation as a devotee. Therefore these three tattvas [Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Gosāñi] are the predominators, or masters.

/* TEXT 14 */
> eka mahāprabhu, āra prabhu duijana
> dui prabhu seve mahāprabhura caraṇa

One of Them is Mahāprabhu, and the other two are prabhus. These two prabhus serve the lotus feet of Mahāprabhu.

/* TEXT 15 */
> ei tina tattva,---‘sarvārādhya’ kari māni
> caturtha ye bhakta-tattva,---‘ārādhaka’ jāni

The three predominators [Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu and Advaita Prabhu] are worshipable by all living entities, and the fourth principle [Śrī Gadādhara Prabhu] is to be understood as Their worshiper.

/* TEXT 16 */
> śrīvāsādi yata koṭi koṭi bhakta-gaṇa
> ‘śuddha-bhakta’-tattva-madhye tāṅ-sabāra gaṇana

There are innumerable pure devotees of the Lord, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, who are known as unalloyed devotees.

/* TEXT 17 */
> gadādhara-paṇḍitādi prabhura ‘śakti’-avatāra
> ‘antaraṅga-bhakta’ kari’ gaṇana yāṅhāra

The devotees headed by Gadādhara Paṇḍita are to be considered incarnations of the internal potency of the Lord. They are confidential devotees engaged in the service of the Lord.

/* TEXTS 18–19 */
> yāṅ-sabā lañā prabhura nitya vihāra
> yāṅ-sabā lañā prabhura kīrtana-pracāra
> yāṅ-sabā lañā karena prema āsvādana
> yāṅ-sabā lañā dāna kare prema-dhana

The internal devotees or potencies are all eternal associates in the pastimes of the Lord. Only with them does the Lord advent to propound the saṅkīrtana movement, only with them does the Lord taste the mellow of conjugal love, and only with them does He distribute this love of God to people in general.

/* TEXTS 20–21 */
> sei pañca-tattva mili’ pṛthivī āsiyā
> pūrva-premabhāṇḍārera mudrā ughāḍiyā
> pāṅce mili’ luṭe prema, kare āsvādana
> yata yata piye, tṛṣṇā bāḍhe anukṣaṇa

The characteristics of Kṛṣṇa are understood to be a storehouse of transcendental love. Although that storehouse of love certainly came with Kṛṣṇa when He was present, it was sealed. But when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu came with His associates of the Pañca-tattva, they broke the seal and plundered the storehouse to taste transcendental love of Kṛṣṇa. The more they tasted it, the more their thirst for it grew.

/* TEXT 22 */
> punaḥ punaḥ piyāiyā haya mahāmatta
> nāce, kānde, hāse, gāya, yaiche mada-matta

Śrī Pañca-tattva themselves danced again and again and thus made it easier to drink nectarean love of Godhead. They danced, cried, laughed and chanted like madmen, and in this way they distributed love of Godhead.

/* TEXT 23 */
> pātrāpātra-vicāra nāhi, nāhi sthānāsthāna
> yei yāṅhā pāya, tāṅhā kare prema-dāna

In distributing love of Godhead, Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His associates did not consider who was a fit candidate and who was not, nor where such distribution should or should not take place. They made no conditions. Wherever they got the opportunity, the members of the Pañca-tattva distributed love of Godhead.

/* TEXT 24 */
> luṭiyā, khāiyā, diyā, bhāṇḍāra ujāḍe
> āścarya bhāṇḍāra, prema śata-guṇa bāḍe

Although the members of the Pañca-tattva plundered the storehouse of love of Godhead and ate and distributed its contents, there was no scarcity, for this wonderful storehouse is so complete that as the love is distributed, the supply increases hundreds of times.

/* TEXT 25 */
> uchalila prema-vanyā caudike veḍāya
> strī, vṛddha, bālaka, yuvā, sabāre ḍubāya

The flood of love of Godhead swelled in all directions, and thus young men, old men, women and children were all immersed in that inundation.

/* TEXT 26 */
> aj-jana, durjana, paṅgu, jaḍa, andha-gaṇa
> prema-vanyāya ḍubāila jagatera jana

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will inundate the entire world and drown everyone, whether one be a gentleman, a rogue or even lame, invalid or blind.

/* TEXT 27 */
> jagat ḍubila, jīvera haila bīja nāśa
> tāhā dekhi’ pāṅca janera parama ullāsa

When the five members of the Pañca-tattva saw the entire world drowned in love of Godhead and the seed of material enjoyment in the living entities completely destroyed, they all became exceedingly happy.

/* TEXT 28 */
> yata yata prema-vṛṣṭi kare pañca-jane
> tata tata bāḍhe jala, vyāpe tri-bhuvane

The more the five members of the Pañca-tattva cause the rains of love of Godhead to fall, the more the inundation increases and spreads all over the world.

/* TEXTS 29–30 */
> māyāvādī, karma-niṣṭha kutārkika-gaṇa
> nindaka, pāsaṇḍī yata paḍuyā adhama
> sei saba mahādakṣa dhāñā palāila
> sei vanyā tā-sabāre chuṅite nārila

The impersonalists, fruitive workers, false logicians, blasphemers, nondevotees and lowest among the student community are very expert in avoiding the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and therefore the inundation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot touch them.

/* TEXTS 31–32 */
> tāhā dekhi’ mahāprabhu karena cintana
> jagat ḍubāite āmi kariluṅ yatana
> keha keha eḍāila, pratijñā ha-ila bhaṅga
> tā-sabā ḍubāite pātiba kichu raṅga

Seeing that the Māyāvādīs and others were fleeing, Lord Caitanya thought, "I wanted everyone to be immersed in this inundation of love of Godhead, but some of them have escaped. Therefore I shall devise a trick to drown them also."

/* TEXT 33 */
> eta bali’ mane kichu kariyā vicāra
> sannyāsa-āśrama prabhu kailā aṅgīkāra

Thus the Lord accepted the sannyāsa order of life after full consideration.

/* TEXT 34 */
> cabbiśa vatsara chilā gṛhastha-āśrame
> pañca-viṁśati varṣe kaila yati-dharme

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu remained in householder life for twenty-four years, and on the verge of His twenty-fifth year He accepted the sannyāsa order.

/* TEXT 35 */
> sannyāsa kariyā prabhu kailā ākarṣaṇa
> yateka pālāñāchila tārkikādigaṇa

After accepting the sannyāsa order, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu attracted the attention of all those who had evaded Him, beginning with the logicians.

/* TEXT 36 */
> paḍuyā, pāṣaṇḍī, karmī, nindakādi yata
> tārā āsi’ prabhu-pāya haya avanata

Thus the students, infidels, fruitive workers and critics all came to surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord.

/* TEXT 37 */
> aparādha kṣamāila, ḍubila prema-jale
> kebā eḍāibe prabhura prema-mahājāle

Lord Caitanya excused them all, and they merged into the ocean of devotional service, for no one can escape the unique loving network of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

/* TEXT 38 */
> sabā nistārite prabhu kṛpā-avatāra
> sabā nistārite kare cāturī apāra

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in order to deliver all the fallen souls. Therefore He devised many methods to liberate them from the clutches of māyā.

/* TEXT 39 */
> tabe nija bhakta kaila yata mleccha ādi
> sabe eḍāila mātra kāśīra māyāvādī

All were converted into devotees of Lord Caitanya, even the mlecchas and yavanas. Only the impersonalist followers of Śaṅkarācārya evaded Him.

/* TEXT 40 */
> vṛndāvana yāite prabhu rahilā kāśīte
> māyāvādi-gaṇa tāṅre lāgila nindite

While Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was passing through Vārāṇasī on His way to Vṛndāvana, the Māyāvādī sannyāsī philosophers blasphemed against Him in many ways.

/* TEXT 41 */
> sannyāsī ha-iyā kare gāyana, nācana
> nā kare vedānta-pāṭha, kare saṅkīrtana

The blasphemers said, "Although a sannyāsī, He does not take interest in the study of Vedānta but instead always engages in chanting and dancing in saṅkīrtana.

/* TEXT 42 */
> mūrkha sannyāsī nija-dharma nāhi jāne
> bhāvuka ha-iyā phere bhāvukera sane

"This Caitanya Mahāprabhu is an illiterate sannyāsī and therefore does not know His real function. Guided only by His sentiments, He wanders about in the company of other sentimentalists."

/* TEXT 43 */
> e saba śuniyā prabhu hāse mane mane
> upekṣā kariyā kāro nā kaila sambhāṣaṇe

Hearing all this blasphemy, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu merely smiled to Himself, rejected all these accusations and did not talk with the Māyāvādīs.

/* TEXT 44 */
> upekṣā kariyā kaila mathurā gamana
> mathurā dekhiyā punaḥ kaila āgamana

Thus neglecting the blasphemy of the Vārāṇasī Māyāvādīs, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu proceeded to Mathurā, and after visiting Mathurā He returned to meet the situation.

/* TEXT 45 */
> kāśīte lekhaka śūdra-śrīcandraśekhara
> tāṅra ghare rahilā prabhu svatantra īśvara

This time Lord Caitanya stayed at the house of Candraśekhara, although he was regarded as a śūdra or kāyastha, for the Lord, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is completely independent.

/* TEXT 46 */
> tapana-miśrera ghare bhikṣā-nirvāhaṇa
> sannyāsīra saṅge nāhi māne nimantraṇa

As a matter of principle, Lord Caitanya regularly accepted His food at the house of Tapana Miśra. He never mixed with other sannyāsīs, nor did He accept invitations from them.

/* TEXT 47 */
> sanātana gosāñi āsi’ tāṅhāi mililā
> tāṅra śikṣā lāgi’ prabhu du-māsa rahilā

When Sanātana Gosvāmī came from Bengal, he met Lord Caitanya at the house of Tapana Miśra, where Lord Caitanya remained continuously for two months to teach him devotional service.

/* TEXT 48 */
> tāṅre śikhāilā saba vaiṣṇavera dharma
> bhāgavata-ādi śāstrera yata gūḍha marma

On the basis of scriptures like Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, which reveal these confidential directions, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed Sanātana Gosvāmī regarding all the regular activities of a devotee.

/* TEXT 49 */
> itimadhye candraśekhara, miśra-tapana
> duḥkhī hañā prabhu-pāya kaila nivedana

While Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was instructing Sanātana Gosvāmī, both Candraśekhara and Tapana Miśra became very unhappy. Therefore they submitted an appeal unto the lotus feet of the Lord.

/* TEXT 50 */
> kateka śuniba prabhu tomāra nindana
> nā pāri sahite, ebe chāḍiba jīvana

"How long can we tolerate the blasphemy by Your critics against Your conduct? We should give up our lives rather than hear such blasphemy.

/* TEXT 51 */
> tomāre nindaye yata sannyāsīra gaṇa
> śunite nā pāri, phāṭe hṛdaya-śravaṇa

"The Māyāvādī sannyāsīs are all criticizing Your Holiness. We cannot tolerate hearing such criticism, for this blasphemy breaks our hearts."

/* TEXT 52 */
> ihā śuni rahe prabhu īṣat hāsiyā
> sei kāle eka vipra milila āsiyā

While Tapana Miśra and Candraśekhara were thus talking with Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He only smiled slightly and remained silent. At that time a brāhmaṇa came there to meet the Lord.

/* TEXT 53 */
> āsi’ nivedana kare caraṇe dhariyā
> eka vastu māgoṅ, deha prasanna ha-iyā

The brāhmaṇa immediately fell at the lotus feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu and requested Him to accept his proposal in a joyful mood.

/* TEXT 54 */
> sakala sannyāsī muñi kainu nimantraṇa
> tumi yadi āisa, pūrṇa haya mora mana

"My dear Lord, I have invited all the sannyāsīs of Benares to my home. My desires will be fulfilled if You also accept my invitation.

/* TEXT 55 */
> nā yāha sannyāsi-goṣṭhī, ihā āmi jāni
> more anugraha kara nimantraṇa māni’

"My dear Lord, I know that You never mix with other sannyāsīs, but please be merciful unto me and accept my invitation."

/* TEXT56 */
> prabhu hāsi’ nimantraṇa kaila aṅgīkāra
> sannyāsīre kṛpā lāgi’ e bhaṅgī tāṅhāra

Lord Caitanya smiled and accepted the invitation of the brāhmaṇa. He made this gesture to show His mercy to the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs.

/* TEXT 57 */
> se vipra jānena prabhu nā yā’na kā’ra ghare
> tāṅhāra preraṇāya tāṅre atyāgraha kare

The brāhmaṇa knew that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu never went to anyone else’s house, yet due to inspiration from the Lord he earnestly requested Him to accept this invitation.

/* TEXT 58 */
> āra dine gelā prabhu se vipra-bhavane
> dekhilena, vasiyāchena sannyāsīra gaṇe

The next day, when Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the house of that brāhmaṇa, He saw all the sannyāsīs of Benares sitting there.

/* TEXT 59 */
> sabā namaskari’ gelā pāda-prakṣālane
> pāda prakṣālana kari vasilā sei sthāne

As soon as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu saw the sannyāsīs He immediately offered obeisances, and then He went to wash His feet. After washing His feet, He sat down by the place where He had done so.

/* TEXT 60 */
> vasiyā karilā kichu aiśvarya prakāśa
> mahātejomaya vapu koṭi-sūryābhāsa

After sitting on the ground, Caitanya Mahāprabhu exhibited His mystic power by manifesting an effulgence as brilliant as the illumination of millions of suns.

/* TEXT 61 */
> prabhāve ākarṣila saba sannyāsīra mana
> uṭhila sannyāsī saba chāḍiyā āsana

When the sannyāsīs saw the brilliant illumination of the body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, their minds were attracted, and they all immediately gave up their sitting places and stood in respect.

/* TEXT 62 */
> prakāśānanda-nāme sarva sannyāsi-pradhāna
> prabhuke kahila kichu kariyā sammāna

The leader of all the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs present was named Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, and after standing up he addressed Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu as follows with great respect.

/* TEXT 63 */
> ihāṅ āisa, ihāṅ āisa, śunaha śrīpāda
> apavitra sthāne vaisa, kibā avasāda

"Please come here. Please come here, Your Holiness. Why do You sit in that unclean place? What has caused Your lamentation?"

/* TEXT 64 */
> prabhu kahe,---āmi ha-i hīna-sampradāya
> tomā-sabāra sabhāya vasite nā yuyāya

The Lord replied, "I belong to a lower order of sannyāsīs. Therefore I do not deserve to sit with you."

/* TEXT 65 */
> āpane prakāśānanda hātete dhariyā
> vasāilā sabhā-madhye sammāna kariyā

Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, however, caught Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally by the hand and seated Him with great respect in the midst of the assembly.

/* TEXT 66 */
> puchila, tomāra nāma ‘śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya’
> keśava-bhāratīra śiṣya, tāte tumi dhanya

Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī then said, "I understand that Your name is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. You are a disciple of Śrī Keśava Bhāratī, and therefore You are glorious.

/* TEXT 67 */
> sāmpradāyika sannyāsī tumi, raha ei grāme
> ki kāraṇe āmā-sabāra nā kara darśane

"You belong to our Śaṅkara-sampradāya and live in our village, Vārāṇasī. Why then do You not associate with us? Why is it that You avoid even seeing us?

/* TEXT 68 */
> sannyāsī ha-iyā kara nartana-gāyana
> bhāvuka saba saṅge lañā kara saṅkīrtana

"You are a sannyāsī. Why then do You indulge in chanting and dancing, engaging in Your saṅkīrtana movement in the company of fanatics?

/* TEXT 69 */
> vedānta-paṭhana, dhyāna,---sannyāsīra dharma
> tāhā chāḍi’ kara kene bhāvukera karma

"Meditation and the study of Vedānta are the sole duties of a sannyāsī. Why do You abandon these to dance with fanatics?

/* TEXT 70 */
> prabhāve dekhiye tomā sākṣāt nārāyaṇa
> hīnācāra kara kene, ithe ki kāraṇa

"You look as brilliant as if You were Nārāyaṇa Himself. Will You kindly explain the reason that You have adopted the behavior of lower-class people?"

/* TEXT 71 */
> prabhu kahe---śuna, śrīpāda, ihāra kāraṇa
> guru more mūrkha dekhi’ karila śāsana

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied to Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, "My dear sir, kindly hear the reason. My spiritual master considered Me a fool, and therefore he chastised Me.

/* TEXT 72 */
> mūrkha tumi, tomāra nāhika vedāntādhikāra
> ‘kṛṣṇa-mantra’ japa sadā,---ei mantra-sāra

"‘You are a fool,’ he said. ‘You are not qualified to study Vedānta philosophy, and therefore You must always chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. This is the essence of all mantras, or Vedic hymns.

/* TEXT 73 */
> kṛṣṇa-mantra haite habe saṁsāra-mocana
> kṛṣṇa-nāma haite pābe kṛṣṇera caraṇa

"‘Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa one can obtain freedom from material existence. Indeed, simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra one will be able to see the lotus feet of the Lord.

/* TEXT 74 */
> nāma vinu kali-kāle nāhi āra dharma
> sarva-mantra-sāra nāma, ei śāstra-marma

"‘In this Age of Kali there is no religious principle other than the chanting of the holy name, which is the essence of all Vedic hymns. This is the purport of all scriptures.’

/* TEXT 75 */
> eta bali’ eka śloka śikhāila more
> kaṇṭhe kari’ ei śloka kariha vicāre

"After describing the potency of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra, My spiritual master taught Me another verse, advising Me to always keep it within My throat.

/* TEXT 76 */
> harer nāma harer nāma
> harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva
> nāsty eva gatir anyathā

"‘For spiritual progress in this Age of Kali, there is no alternative, there is no alternative, there is no alternative to the holy name, the holy name, the holy name of the Lord.’

> nāma laite laite mora bhrānta haila mana

"Since I received this order from My spiritual master, I always chant the holy name, but I thought that by chanting and chanting the holy name I had been bewildered.

"While chanting the holy name of the Lord in pure ecstasy, I lose Myself, and thus I laugh, cry, dance and sing just like a madman.

/* TEXT 79 */

> kṛṣṇa-nāme jñānācchanna ha-ila āmāra

"Collecting My patience, therefore, I began to consider that chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa had covered all My spiritual knowledge.

/* TEXT 80 */
> pāgala ha-ilāṅ āmi, dhairya nāhi mane
> eta cinti’ nivediluṅ gurura caraṇe

"I saw that I had become mad by chanting the holy name, and I immediately submitted this at the lotus feet of my spiritual master.

/* TEXT 81 */

> japite japite mantra karila pāgala

"‘My dear lord, what kind of mantra have you given Me? I have become mad simply by chanting this mahā-mantra!

/* TEXT 82 */
> hāsāya, nācāya, more karāya krandana
> eta śuni’ guru hāsi balilā vacana

"‘Chanting the holy name in ecstasy causes Me to dance, laugh and cry.’ When My spiritual master heard all this, he smiled and then began to speak.

/* TEXT 83 */
> kṛṣṇa-nāma-mahā-mantrera ei ta’ svabhāva
> yei jape, tāra kṛṣṇe upajaye bhāva

"‘It is the nature of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra that anyone who chants it immediately develops his loving ecstasy for Kṛṣṇa.

/* TEXT 84 */
> kṛṣṇa-viṣayaka premā---parama puruṣārtha
> yāra āge tṛṇa-tulya cāri puruṣārtha

"‘Religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation are known as the four goals of life, but before love of Godhead, the fifth and highest goal, these appear as insignificant as straw in the street.

> mokṣādi ānanda yāra nahe eka bindu

"‘For a devotee who has actually developed bhāva, the pleasure derived from dharma, artha, kāma and mokṣa appears like a drop in the presence of the sea.

"‘It is a characteristic of love of Godhead that by nature it induces transcendental symptoms in one’s body and makes one more and more greedy to achieve the shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord.

> unmatta ha-iyā nāce, iti-uti dhāya

"‘Perspiration, trembling, standing on end of one’s bodily hairs, tears, faltering voice, fading complexion, madness, melancholy, patience, pride, joy and humility---these are various natural symptoms of ecstatic love of Godhead, which causes a devotee to dance and float in an ocean of transcendental bliss while chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra.

"Saying this, My spiritual master taught Me a verse from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. It is the essence of all the Bhāgavatam’s instructions; therefore he recited this verse again and again.

"I firmly believe in these words of My spiritual master, and therefore I always chant the holy name of the Lord, alone and in the association of devotees. That holy name of Lord Kṛṣṇa sometimes causes Me to chant and dance, and therefore I chant and dance. Please do not think that I intentionally do it. I do it automatically.

"Compared to the ocean of transcendental bliss that one tastes by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, the pleasure derived from impersonal Brahman realization [brahmānanda] is like the shallow water in a canal.

After hearing Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs were moved. Their minds changed, and thus they spoke with pleasing words.

/* TEXT 102 */

After hearing the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs speak in that way, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu smiled slightly and said, "My dear sirs, if you don’t mind I can say something to you regarding Vedānta philosophy."

/* TEXT 103 */
> ihā śuni’ bale sarva sannyāsīra gaṇa

Hearing this, the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs became somewhat humble and addressed Caitanya Mahāprabhu as Nārāyaṇa Himself, who they all agreed He was.

/* TEXT 104 */
> tomāra vacana śuni’ juḍāya śravaṇa

"Dear Caitanya Mahāprabhu," they said, "to tell You the truth, we are greatly pleased to hear Your words, and furthermore Your bodily features are so pleasing that we feel extraordinary satisfaction in seeing You.

"Everything about the Supreme Personality of Godhead is spiritual, including His body, opulence and paraphernalia. Māyāvāda philosophy, however, covering His spiritual opulence, advocates the theory of impersonalism.

/* TEXT 113 */

"Śaṅkarācārya, who is an incarnation of Lord Śiva, is faultless because he is a servant carrying out the orders of the Lord. But those who follow his Māyāvādī philosophy are doomed. They will lose all their advancement in spiritual knowledge.

"One who considers the transcendental body of Lord Viṣṇu to be made of material nature is the greatest offender at the lotus feet of the Lord. There is no greater blasphemy against the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The living entities are energies, not the energetic. The energetic is Kṛṣṇa. This is very vividly described in the Bhagavad-gītā, the Viṣṇu Purāṇa and other Vedic literatures.

/* TEXT 121 */
> vyāsera sūtrete kahe ‘pariṇāma’-vāda
> ‘vyāsa bhrānta’---bali’ tāra uṭhāila vivāda

"In his Vedānta-sūtra Śrīla Vyāsadeva has described that everything is but a transformation of the energy of the Lord. Śaṅkarācārya, however, has misled the world by commenting that Vyāsadeva was mistaken. Thus he has raised great opposition to theism throughout the entire world.

/* TEXT 122 */
> pariṇāma-vāde īśvara hayena vikārī

"According to Śaṅkarācārya, by accepting the theory of the transformation of the energy of the Lord, one creates an illusion by indirectly accepting that the Absolute Truth is transformed.

/* TEXT 123 */
> vastutaḥ pariṇāma-vāda---sei se pramāṇa

"Transformation of energy is a proven fact. It is the false bodily conception of the self that is an illusion.

"The Vedic sound vibration oṁkāra, the principal word in the Vedic literatures, is the basis of all Vedic vibrations. Therefore one should accept oṁkāra as the sound representation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the reservoir of the cosmic manifestation.

/* TEXT 129 */

"It is the purpose of the Supreme Personality of Godhead to present praṇava [oṁkāra] as the reservoir of all Vedic knowledge. The words ‘tat tvam asi’ are only a partial explanation of the Vedic knowledge.

/* TEXT 130 */

"Praṇava [oṁkāra] is the mahā-vākya [mahā-mantra] in the Vedas. Śaṅkarācārya’s followers cover this to stress without authority the mantra tat tvam asi.

When Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu thus showed for each and every sūtra the defects in Śaṅkarācārya’s explanations, all the assembled Māyāvādī sannyāsīs were struck with wonder.

/* TEXT 135 */
> sakala sannyāsī kahe,---‘śunaha śrīpāda

All the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs said, "Your Holiness, kindly know from us that we actually have no quarrel with Your refutation of these meanings, for You have given a clear understanding of the sūtras.

/* TEXT 136 */
> ācārya-kalpita artha,---ihā sabhe jāni

"We know that all this word jugglery springs from the imagination of Śaṅkarācārya, and yet because we belong to his sect, we accept it although it does not satisfy us.

"Now let us see," the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs continued, "how well You can describe the sūtras in terms of their direct meaning." Hearing this, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu began His direct explanation of the Vedānta-sūtra.

/* TEXT 138 */
> bṛhad-vastu ‘brahma’ kahi---‘śrī-bhagavān’
> ṣaḍ-vidhaiśvarya-pūrṇa, para-tattva-dhāma

"Brahman, who is greater than the greatest, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He is full in six opulences, and therefore He is the reservoir of ultimate truth and absolute knowledge.

/* TEXT 139 */
> svarūpa-aiśvarye tāṅra nāhi māyā-gandha

"In His original form the Supreme Personality of Godhead is full with transcendental opulences, which are free from the contamination of the material world. It is to be understood that in all Vedic literature the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate goal.

> pañcama puruṣārtha sei prema-mahādhana

"Love of Godhead is so exalted that it is considered to be the fifth goal of human life. By awakening one’s love of Godhead, one can attain the platform of conjugal love, tasting it even during the present span of life.

/* TEXT 145 */
> premā haite kṛṣṇa haya nija bhakta-vaśa
> premā haite pāya kṛṣṇera sevā-sukha-rasa

"The Supreme Lord, who is greater than the greatest, becomes submissive to even a very insignificant devotee because of his devotional service. It is the beautiful and exalted nature of devotional service that the infinite Lord becomes submissive to the infinitesimal living entity because of it. In reciprocal devotional activities with the Lord, the devotee actually enjoys the transcendental mellow of devotional service.

/* TEXT 146 */

"One’s relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, activities in terms of that relationship, and the ultimate goal of life [to develop love of God]---these three subjects are explained in every aphorism of the Vedānta-sūtra, for they form the culmination of the entire Vedānta philosophy."

/* TEXT 147 */
> ei-mata sarva-sūtrera vyākhyāna śuniyā

When all the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs thus heard the explanation of Caitanya Mahāprabhu on the basis of sambandha, abhidheya and prayojana, they spoke very humbly.

/* TEXT 149 */
> sei haite sannyāsīra phiri gela mana

From that moment when the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs heard the explanation of the Vedānta-sūtra from the Lord, their minds changed, and on the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they too chanted "Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa!" always.

/* TEXT 150 */
> ei-mate tāṅ-sabāra kṣami’ aparādha

Thus Lord Caitanya excused all the offenses of the Māyāvādī sannyāsīs and very mercifully blessed them with kṛṣṇa-nāma.
