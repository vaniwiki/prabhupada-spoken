[Devotees chanting //japa// in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got? All right. Come on. He is showing his father. [//japa//] [break]

**Karandhara:**
[to Prabhupāda] Ameyātmā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ameyātmā. [//japa//] You know the rules and regulation? Rules and regulation?

**Devotee:**
Four regulative principles.

**Ameyātmā:**
No illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mm-hm. And how many rounds you will chant?

**Ameyātmā:**
Sixteen.

**Prabhupāda:**
Minimum. Yes. So your spiritual name is...

**Karandhara:**
Ameyātmā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Ameya-ātmā, or Ameyātmā, the //ātmā,// which cannot be measured. Come on.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!//

**Karandhara:**
George? [//japa//] Satāṁ-gatī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Satāṁ-gatī. [//japa//] What are the rules?

**George:**
No meat, fish or eggs, no intoxication, no gambling, no [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Your spiritual name, Satāṁ-gatī. Satāṁ-gatī means the path of devotees. 

> satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido
> bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ
> [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]

When about Kṛṣṇa anything is discussed amongst the devotees, //satāṁ prasaṅgān,// at that time it becomes very pleasing to the ear and to the heart.

> satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido
> bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ
> [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]

That message becomes very pleasing to the ear and the heart. //Taj-joṣaṇād āśv apavarga-vartmani.// And if one practically applies in his life, then //śraddhā bhaktir ratir anukramiṣyati,// then he makes progress in spiritual life.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [//japa//]

**Karandhara:**
Dharma-dakṣa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dharma-dakṣa. [//japa//] Where is Girirāja? He does not come?

**Karandhara:**
He was here earlier.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. So, what are the rules and regulation?

**Dharma-dakṣa:**
No meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxicants, no illicit sex life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Very dangerous, these things. You know that? [laughter] Yes. So, your spiritual name is Dharma-dakṣa, "in charge of religious principle." Dharma-dakṣa. Huh? Take it.

**Karandhara:**
Willie?

**Prabhupāda:**
What is //dharma?// You are going to be in charge of religious principle, and what is religion?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
[to devotee:] What is religion?

**Dharma-dakṣa:**
Oh. Remembering Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. So your name is Mahāvīrya. Means "very great, powerful."

**Devotees:**

Pat. [to Prabhupāda] Surānanda. Surānanda. Surānanda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Surānanda. So, what are the rules and regulation?

**Pat:**
No meat-eating, no intoxication, no illicit sex and no gambling.

**Prabhupāda:**
So your spiritual name is Surānanda. //Sura,// this word, it, it becomes, //sura// means "liquor," and //sura// means "the demigods or the devotees." //Sura-asura. Asura// means demons. So your name is Surānanda. That don’t be... //Ananda// means pleasure, so it can bear two meanings. [laughs] [laughter] Don’t take pleasure in liquor. No. [laughter] Surānanda means to be associate with the devotees. That is Surānanda.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [//japa//]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Now you know the rules and regulation?

**Luis:**
No illicit sex, no intoxication, no gamble, no eat meat, including fish or egg.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [aside] What is the...? Loka-dakṣa. Loka-dakṣa. Loka-dakṣa means Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram.// Nobody is proprietor of anything. This planet belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Not only this planet, other planets also. So Loka-dakṣa means Kṛṣṇa. Loka-dakṣa dāsa. All right.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [//japa//]

**Karandhara:**
Randy? [to Prabhupāda] His name is Mahā-buddhi. Mahā-buddhi.

**Prabhupāda:**

**Randy:**
No illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating and no intoxication.

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s nice. Thank you. So your spiritual name is Mahā-buddhi. //Maha// means "great, unlimited," and //buddhi// means "intelligence." So Kṛṣṇa is unlimitedly intelligent. Therefore you become Mahā-buddhi dāsa, Kṛṣṇa's //dāsa.// Come on. //Dāsa// means servant.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [//japa//]

**Gail:**
No eating of meat, fish or eggs, no intoxication, no gambling and no illicit sex.

**Prabhupāda:**
First class. Your name is Rasāṅgī. //Rasa, rasa// means ānanda. //Ānanda// means "pleasure," "transcendental bliss." So, //aṅga// means "part and parcel." Rasāṅgīni dāsī. Come on.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [//japa//]

**Karandhara:**

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, what are the rules and regulation?

**Rūpacandra:**
No intoxication, no illicit sex, no gambling and no meat-eating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, repetition of these four principles means you..., everyone should remember that you are promising before Kṛṣṇa. Just like there is affidavit in..., before the magistrate. If you break that, then you will be criminal. Similarly, whatever promise you are making before Kṛṣṇa, if you violate, it is a great sin, and you will be punished for that. So remember always. What is it?

**Karandhara:**
Rūpacandra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, so your name is Rūpacandra, "as beautiful as moon."

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [//japa//]

[to Prabhupāda] Her name is Madana-sundarī

**Prabhupāda:**
So, what are the rules and regulation?

**Madana-sundarī:**
No eating meat, fish or eggs, no intoxication, no gambling, no illicit sex.

**Prabhupāda:**
So your spiritual name is Madana-sundarī. Madana-sundarī, whereas so beautiful that one can captivate Kṛṣṇa, that is Rādhārāṇī, so Madana-sundarī dāsī means "maidservant of Rādhārāṇī."

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [//japa//]

**Hṛdayānanda:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda! //Haribol!//

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// All glories to Prabhupāda! //Haribol// Prabhupāda! [end]
