===== The Trunk, Branches and Subbranches of the Caitanya Tree =====

/* TEXT 1 */
> śrī-caitanya-padāmbhoja-
> madhupebhyo namo namaḥ
> kathañcid āśrayād yeṣāṁ
> śvāpi tad-gandha-bhāg bhavet

Let me repeatedly offer my respectful obeisances unto the beelike devotees who always taste the honey of the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. If even a doggish nondevotee somehow takes shelter of such devotees, he enjoys the aroma of the lotus flower.

/* TEXT 2 */
> jaya jaya śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nityānanda
> jayādvaitacandra jaya gaura-bhakta-vṛnda

All glories to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Lord Nityānanda! All glories to Advaita Prabhu, and all glories to the devotees of Lord Caitanya, headed by Śrīvāsa!

/* TEXT 3 */
> ei mālīra---ei vṛkṣera akathya kathana
> ebe śuna mukhya-śākhāra nāma-vivaraṇa

The description of Lord Caitanya as the gardener and the tree is inconceivable. Now hear with attention about the branches of this tree.

/* TEXT 4 */
> caitanya-gosāñira yata pāriṣada-caya
> guru-laghu-bhāva tāṅra nā haya niścaya

The associates of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu were many, but none of them should be considered lower or higher. This cannot be ascertained.

/* TEXT 5 */
> yata yata mahānta kailā tāṅ-sabāra gaṇana
> keha karibāre nāre jyeṣṭha-laghu-krama

All the great personalities in the line of Lord Caitanya enumerated these devotees, but they could not distinguish between the greater and the lesser.

/* TEXT 6 */
> ataeva tāṅ-sabāre kari’ namaskāra
> nāma-mātra kari, doṣa nā labe āmāra

I offer my obeisances unto them as a token of respect. I request them not to consider my offenses.

/* TEXT 7 */
> vande śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> premāmara-taroḥ priyān
> śākhā-rūpān bhakta-gaṇān
> kṛṣṇa-prema-phala-pradān

I offer my obeisances to all the dear devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the eternal tree of love of Godhead. I offer my respects to all the branches of the tree, the devotees of the Lord who distribute the fruit of love of Kṛṣṇa.

/* TEXT 8 */
> śrīvāsa paṇḍita, āra śrī-rāma paṇḍita
> dui bhāi---dui śākhā, jagate vidita

The two brothers Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita and Śrī Rāma Paṇḍita started two branches that are well known in the world.

/* TEXT 9 */
> śrīpati, śrīnidhi---tāṅra dui sahodara
> cāri bhāira dāsa-dāsī, gṛha-parikara

Their two brothers were named Śrīpati and Śrīnidhi. These four brothers and their servants and maidservants are considered one big branch.

/* TEXT 10 */
> dui śākhāra upaśākhāya tāṅ-sabāra gaṇana
> yāṅra gṛhe mahāprabhura sadā saṅkīrtana

There is no counting the subbranches of these two branches. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu held congregational chanting daily at the house of Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita.

/* TEXT 11 */
> cāri bhāi sa-vaṁśe kare caitanyera sevā
> gauracandra vinā nāhi jāne devī-devā

These four brothers and their family members fully engaged in the service of Lord Caitanya. They knew no other god or goddess.

/* TEXT 12 */
> ‘ācāryaratna’ nāma dhare baḍa eka śākhā
> tāṅra parikara, tāṅra śākhā-upaśākhā

Another big branch was Ācāryaratna, and his associates were subbranches.

/* TEXT 13 */
> ācāryaratnera nāma ‘śrī-candraśekhara’
> yāṅra ghare devī-bhāve nācilā īśvara

Ācāryaratna was also named Śrī Candraśekhara Ācārya. In a drama in his house, Lord Caitanya played the goddess of fortune.

/* TEXT 14 */
> puṇḍarīka vidyānidhi---baḍa-śākhā jāni
> yāṅra nāma lañā prabhu kāndilā āpani

Puṇḍarīka Vidyānidhi, the third big branch, was so dear to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu that in his absence Lord Caitanya Himself would sometimes cry.

/* TEXT 15 */
> baḍa śākhā,---gadādhara paṇḍita-gosāñi
> teṅho lakṣmī-rūpā, tāṅra sama keha nāi

Gadādhara Paṇḍita, the fourth branch, is described as an incarnation of the pleasure potency of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. No one, therefore, can equal him.

/* TEXT 16 */
> tāṅra śiṣya-upaśiṣya,---tāṅra upaśākhā
> eimata saba śākhā-upaśākhāra lekhā

His disciples and granddisciples are his subbranches. To describe them all would be difficult.

/* TEXT 17 */
> vakreśvara paṇḍita---prabhura baḍa priya bhṛtya
> eka-bhāve cabbiśa prahara yāṅra nṛtya

Vakreśvara Paṇḍita, the fifth branch of the tree, was a very dear servant of Lord Caitanya’s. He could dance with constant ecstasy for seventy-two hours.

/* TEXT 18 */
> āpane mahāprabhu gāya yāṅra nṛtya-kāle
> prabhura caraṇa dhari’ vakreśvara bale

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally sang while Vakreśvara Paṇḍita danced, and thus Vakreśvara Paṇḍita fell at the lotus feet of the Lord and spoke as follows.

/* TEXT 19 */
> "daśa-sahasra gandharva more deha’ candramukha
> tārā gāya, muñi nācoṅ---tabe mora sukha"

"O Candramukha! Please give me ten thousand Gandharvas. Let them sing as I dance, and then I will be greatly happy."

/* TEXT 20 */
> prabhu bale---tumi mora pakṣa eka śākhā
> ākāśe uḍitāma yadi pāṅ āra pākhā

Lord Caitanya replied, "I have only one wing like you, but if I had another, certainly I would fly in the sky!"

/* TEXT 21 */
> paṇḍita jagadānanda prabhura prāṇa-rūpa
> loke khyāta yeṅho satyabhāmāra svarūpa

Paṇḍita Jagadānanda, the sixth branch of the Caitanya tree, was celebrated as the life and soul of the Lord. He is known to have been an incarnation of Satyabhāmā [one of the chief queens of Lord Kṛṣṇa].

/* TEXT 22 */
> prītye karite cāhe prabhura lālana-pālana
> vairāgya-loka-bhaye prabhu nā māne kakhana

Jagadānanda Paṇḍita [as an incarnation of Satyabhāmā] always wanted to see to the comfort of Lord Caitanya, but since the Lord was a sannyāsī He did not accept the luxuries that Jagadānanda Paṇḍita offered.

/* TEXT 23 */
> dui-jane khaṭmaṭi lāgāya kondala
> tāṅra prītyera kathā āge kahiba sakala

They sometimes appeared to fight over trifles, but these quarrels were based on their affection, of which I shall speak later.

/* TEXT 24 */
> rāghava-paṇḍita---prabhura ādya-anucara
> tāṅra eka śākhā mukhya---makaradhvaja kara

Rāghava Paṇḍita, Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s original follower, is understood to have been the seventh branch. From him proceeded another subbranch, headed by Makaradhvaja Kara.

/* TEXT 25 */
> tāṅhāra bhaginī damayantī prabhura priya dāsī
> prabhura bhoga-sāmagrī ye kare vāra-māsi

Rāghava Paṇḍita’s sister Damayantī was the dear maidservant of the Lord. She always collected various ingredients with which to cook for Lord Caitanya.

/* TEXT 26 */
> se saba sāmagrī yata jhālite bhariyā
> rāghava la-iyā yā’na gupata kariyā

The foods Damayantī cooked for Lord Caitanya when He was at Purī were carried in bags by her brother Rāghava without the knowledge of others.

/* TEXT 27 */
> vāra-māsa tāhā prabhu karena aṅgīkāra
> ‘rāghavera jhāli’ bali’ prasiddhi yāhāra

The Lord accepted these foods throughout the entire year. Those bags are still celebrated as rāghavera jhāli ["the bags of Rāghava Paṇḍita"].

/* TEXT 28 */
> se-saba sāmagrī āge kariba vistāra
> yāhāra śravaṇe bhaktera vahe aśrudhāra

I shall describe the contents of the bags of Rāghava Paṇḍita later in this book. Hearing this narration, devotees generally cry, and tears glide down from their eyes.

/* TEXT 29 */
> prabhura atyanta priya---paṇḍita gaṅgādāsa
> yāṅhāra smaraṇe haya sarva-bandha-nāśa

Paṇḍita Gaṅgādāsa was the eighth dear branch of the tree of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One who remembers his activities attains freedom from all bondage.

/* TEXT 30 */
> caitanya-pārṣada---śrī-ācārya purandara
> pitā kari’ yāṅre bale gaurāṅga-sundara

Śrī Ācārya Purandara, the ninth branch, was a constant associate of Lord Caitanya’s. The Lord accepted him as His father.

/* TEXT 31 */
> dāmodara-paṇḍita śākhā premete pracaṇḍa
> prabhura upare yeṅho kaila vākya-daṇḍa

Dāmodara Paṇḍita, the tenth branch of the Caitanya tree, was so elevated in love of Lord Caitanya that he once unhesitatingly chastised the Lord with strong words.

/* TEXT 32 */
> daṇḍa-kathā kahiba āge vistāra kariyā
> daṇḍe tuṣṭa prabhu tāṅre pāṭhāilā nadīyā

Later in the Caitanya-caritāmṛta I shall describe this incident of chastisement in detail. The Lord, being very much satisfied by this chastisement, sent Dāmodara Paṇḍita to Navadvīpa.

/* TEXT 33 */
> tāṅhāra anuja śākhā---śaṅkara-paṇḍita
> ‘prabhu-pādopādhāna’ yāṅra nāma vidita

The eleventh branch, the younger brother of Dāmodara Paṇḍita, was known as Śaṅkara Paṇḍita. He was celebrated as the shoes of the Lord.

/* TEXT 34 */
> sadāśiva-paṇḍita yāṅra prabhu-pade āśa
> prathamei nityānandera yāṅra ghare vāsa

Sadāśiva Paṇḍita, the twelfth branch, was always eager to serve the lotus feet of the Lord. It was his good fortune that when Lord Nityānanda came to Navadvīpa He resided at his house.

/* TEXT 35 */
> śrī-nṛsiṁha-upāsaka---pradyumna brahmacārī
> prabhu tāṅra nāma kailā ‘nṛsiṁhānanda’ kari’

The thirteenth branch was Pradyumna Brahmacārī. Since he was a worshiper of Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu changed his name to Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī.

/* TEXT 36 */
> nārāyaṇa-paṇḍita eka baḍai udāra
> caitanya-caraṇa vinu nāhi jāne āra

Nārāyaṇa Paṇḍita, the fourteenth branch, a great and liberal devotee, did not know any shelter but Lord Caitanya’s lotus feet.

/* TEXT 37 */
> śrīmān-paṇḍita śākhā---prabhura nija bhṛtya
> deuṭi dharena, yabe prabhu karena nṛtya

The fifteenth branch was Śrīmān Paṇḍita, who was a constant servitor of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He used to carry a torch while the Lord danced.

/* TEXT 38 */
> śuklāmbara-brahmacārī baḍa bhāgyavān
> yāṅra anna māgi’ kāḍi’ khāilā bhagavān

The sixteenth branch, Śuklāmbara Brahmacārī, was very fortunate because Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu jokingly or seriously begged food from him or sometimes snatched it from him forcibly and ate it.

/* TEXT 39 */
> nandana-ācārya-śākhā jagate vidita
> lukāiyā dui prabhura yāṅra ghare sthita

Nandana Ācārya, the seventeenth branch of the Caitanya tree, is celebrated within the world because the two Prabhus [Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda] sometimes hid in his house.

> yāṅhāra kīrtane nāce caitanya-gosāñi

Mukunda Datta, a class friend of Lord Caitanya’s, was another branch of the Caitanya tree. Lord Caitanya danced while he sang.

/* TEXT 41 */
> vāsudeva datta---prabhura bhṛtya mahāśaya
> sahasra-mukhe yāṅra guṇa kahile nā haya

Vāsudeva Datta, the nineteenth branch of the Śrī Caitanya tree, was a great personality and a most confidential devotee of the Lord. One could not describe his qualities even with thousands of mouths.

/* TEXT 42 */
> jagate yateka jīva, tāra pāpa lañā
> naraka bhuñjite cāhe jīva chāḍāiyā

Śrīla Vāsudeva Datta Ṭhākura wanted to suffer for the sinful activities of all the people of the world so that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu might deliver them.

/* TEXT 43 */
> haridāsa-ṭhākura śākhāra adbhuta carita
> tina lakṣa nāma teṅho layena apatita

The twentieth branch of the Caitanya tree was Haridāsa Ṭhākura. His character was wonderful. He used to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa 300,000 times a day without fail.

/* TEXT 44 */
> tāṅhāra ananta guṇa---kahi diṅmātra
> ācārya gosāñi yāṅre bhuñjāya śrāddha-pātra

There was no end to the transcendental qualities of Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Here I mention but a fraction of his qualities. He was so exalted that Advaita Gosvāmī, when performing the śrāddha ceremony of his father, offered him the first plate.

/* TEXT 45 */
> prahlāda-samāna tāṅra guṇera taraṅga
> yavana-tāḍaneo yāṅra nāhika bhrū-bhaṅga

The waves of his good qualities were like those of Prahlāda Mahārāja. He did not even slightly raise an eyebrow when persecuted by the Muslim ruler.

/* TEXT 46 */

> nācila caitanya-prabhu mahā-kutūhale

After the passing away of Haridāsa Ṭhākura, the Lord Himself took his body on His lap and danced with it in great ecstasy.

/* TEXT 47 */
> tāṅra līlā varṇiyāchena vṛndāvana-dāsa
> yebā avaśiṣṭa, āge kariba prakāśa

Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has vividly described the pastimes of Haridāsa Ṭhākura in his Caitanya-bhāgavata. Whatever has remained undescribed I shall try to explain later in this book.

/* TEXT 48 */
> tāṅra upaśākhā---yata kulīna-grāmī jana
> satyarāja-ādi---tāṅra kṛpāra bhājana

One subbranch of Haridāsa Ṭhākura consisted of the residents of Kulīna-grāma. The most important among them was Satyarāja Khān, or Satyarāja Vasu, who was a recipient of all the mercy of Haridāsa Ṭhākura.

/* TEXT 49 */
> śrī-murāri gupta śākhā---premera bhāṇḍāra
> prabhura hṛdaya drave śuni’ dainya yāṅra

Murāri Gupta, the twenty-first branch of the tree of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, was a storehouse of love of Godhead. His great humility and meekness melted the heart of Lord Caitanya.

/* TEXT 50 */
> pratigraha nāhi kare, nā laya kāra dhana
> ātma-vṛtti kari’ kare kuṭumba bharaṇa

Śrīla Murāri Gupta never accepted charity from friends, nor did he accept money from anyone. He practiced as a physician and maintained his family with his earnings.

/* TEXT 51 */

> deha-roga bhāva-roga,---dui tāra kṣaya

As Murāri Gupta treated his patients, by his mercy both their bodily and spiritual diseases subsided.

> śrīmān sena prabhura sevaka pradhāna
> caitanya-caraṇa vinu nāhi jāne āna

Śrīmān Sena, the twenty-second branch of the Caitanya tree, was a very faithful servant of Lord Caitanya. He knew nothing else but the lotus feet of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> śrī-gadādhara dāsa śākhā sarvopari
> kājī-gaṇera mukhe yeṅha bolāila hari

Śrī Gadādhara dāsa, the twenty-third branch, was understood to be the topmost, for he induced all the Muslim Kazis to chant the holy name of Lord Hari.

/* TEXT 54 */
> śivānanda sena---prabhura bhṛtya antaraṅga
> prabhu-sthāne yāite sabe layena yāṅra saṅga

Śivānanda Sena, the twenty-fourth branch of the tree, was an extremely confidential servant of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Everyone who went to Jagannātha Purī to visit Lord Caitanya took shelter and guidance from Śrī Śivānanda Sena.

/* TEXT 55 */
> prativarṣe prabhu-gaṇa saṅgete lā-iyā
> nīlācale calena pathe pālana kariyā

Every year he took a party of devotees from Bengal to Jagannātha Purī to visit Lord Caitanya. He maintained the entire party as they journeyed on the road.

> ‘sākṣāt,’ ‘āveśa’ āra ‘āvirbhāva’-rūpe

Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu bestows His causeless mercy upon His devotees in three features: His own direct appearance [sākṣāt], His prowess within someone He empowers [āveśa], and His manifestation [āvirbhāva].

/* TEXT 57 */
> ‘sākṣāte’ sakala bhakta dekhe nirviśeṣa
> nakula brahmacāri-dehe prabhura ‘āveśa’

The appearance of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in every devotee’s presence is called sākṣāt. His appearance in Nakula Brahmacārī as a symptom of special prowess is an example of āveśa.

/* TEXT 58 */
> ‘pradyumna brahmacārī’ tāṅra āge nāma chila
> ‘nṛsiṁhānanda’ nāma prabhu pāche ta’ rākhila

The former Pradyumna Brahmacārī was given the name Nṛsiṁhānanda Brahmacārī by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> alaukika aiche prabhura aneka svabhāva

In his body there were symptoms of āvirbhāva. Such appearances are uncommon, but Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu displayed many such pastimes through His different features.

> āsvādila e saba rasa sena śivānanda
> vistāri’ kahiba āge e-saba ānanda

Śrīla Śivānanda Sena experienced the three features of sākṣāt, āveśa and āvirbhāva. Later I shall vividly describe this transcendentally blissful subject.

The sons, servants and family members of Śivānanda Sena constituted a subbranch. They were all sincere servants of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> śrī-vallabhasena, āra sena śrīkānta
> śivānanda-sambandhe prabhura bhakta ekānta

Śrīvallabha Sena and Śrīkānta Sena were also subbranches of Śivānanda Sena, for they were not only his nephews but also unalloyed devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> prabhura kīrtanīyā ādi śrī-govinda datta

Govindānanda and Govinda Datta, the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth branches of the tree, were performers of kīrtana in the company of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Govinda Datta was the principal singer in Lord Caitanya’s kīrtana party.

Śrī Vijaya dāsa, the twenty-seventh branch, another of the Lord’s chief singers, gave the Lord many books written by hand.

> akiñcana prabhura priya kṛṣṇadāsa-nāma

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave Vijaya dāsa the name Ratnabāhu ["jewel-handed"] because he copied many manuscripts for Him. The twenty-eighth branch was Kṛṣṇadāsa, who was very dear to the Lord. He was known as Akiñcana Kṛṣṇadāsa.

/* TEXT 67 */
> kholā-vecā śrīdhara prabhura priya-dāsa
> yāṅhā-sane prabhu kare nitya parihāsa

The twenty-ninth branch was Śrīdhara, a trader in banana-tree bark. He was a very dear servant of the Lord. On many occasions, the Lord played jokes on him.

Devānanda Paṇḍita was a professional reciter of Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, but by the mercy of Vakreśvara Paṇḍita and the grace of the Lord he understood the devotional interpretation of the Bhāgavatam.

/* TEXTS 78–79 */
