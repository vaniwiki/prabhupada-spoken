**Karandhara:**
Prabhupāda, do you want to give the names before the //kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
What?

**Karandhara:**
You want to give the names to the new devotees before the //kīrtana,// and after the //kīrtana// go on the walk?

**Prabhupāda:**
The name is not given?

**Karandhara:**
No. I have the beads.

**Prabhupāda:**
So without name, how can we give?

**Karandhara:**
No, I have the names.

**Prabhupāda:**
Names also?

**Karandhara:**
Do you want to give them now?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Yes. We can give. So come on. No, no, //mantra,// one //mantra.// That //mantra.// Chant //mantra,// then I will give the name.

**Karandhara:**
All right. [break]

**Pradyumna:**
Everyone sip water, take water. Take spoon in left hand.

[break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...such atmosphere. So we have to maintain this. [break]

**Karandhara:**
Jesus. [devotee comes up] Virāha.

**Prabhupāda:**
Virāha. Virāha dāsa. I am not asking individually about the four principle. I suppose you know this. But just I was explaining //sat// and //asat.// These two things are side by side. Just like there is darkness and there is light, you can see merging in the sunlight. You'll see, one side is light, and one side is dark. Similarly, //sat// and //asat,// they are existing side by side. If you don't remain this side, then you come to this side. So it is my choice. So this Hare Kṛṣṇa is the bright side, and the other things, material activities and sinful activities---meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, illicit sex---the dark side. So it is your choice. If you remain the bright side, then your progress is certain, and if you fall down again on the dark side, that is your misfortune. You should always remember that. Come on.

**Karandhara:**
Marcos. Name is, Virabāhu.

**Prabhupāda:**
Your spiritual name---Virabāhu dāsa.

**Karandhara:**
Ilan. Name is Havi, Havi dāsa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Havi?

**Karandhara:**
Havi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Havi. Your name is Havi dāsa.

**Karandhara:**
Argenis.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tamohara. Your name is Tamohara.

**Karandhara:**
Manuel. Pramāṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Pramāṇa. Your name is Pramāṇa dāsa.

**Karandhara:**
Lynne. Manīndra-bhusana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Male? Male? Oh.

**Karandhara:**
No, female.

**Prabhupāda:**
Manīndrā. Manīndrā. That's all.

**Karandhara:**
Cary. Kusumikā.

**Prabhupāda:**
So she has got another?

**Karandhara:**
No, those are extra, just extra sets.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So your name is Kusumikā. [indistinct]

**Karandhara:**
Kaylyn. Kartā, Kartā dāsī.

**Prabhupāda:**

**Prabhupāda:**

**Karandhara:**

That's all, Prabhupāda.

Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
