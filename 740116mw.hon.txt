**Prabhupāda:**
...enjoy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Don't forget Kṛṣṇa. Then you are well. //Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate// [Brs. 1.2.255]. Such a nice park. If we hold //saṅkīrtana,// people gather and enjoy distribution of //prasādam,// then it becomes very nice. And only to come here to find out sex facilities, then going to ruin. [aside:] Give me that. [//japa//] Very good park. [indistinct] [break] ...and for class of people, talking. This is required, philosophical talk, those who will understand. For mass of people //kīrtana// is sufficient.

**Bali-mardana:**
//Kīrtana// and //prasādam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
And then when you start to talk, they become fidgety. [laughter]

**Sudāmā:**
Or they want to argue.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like for children, you give them //prasādam,// all will gather together. You see? And if you talk before them of philosophy, what they will understand? [//japa//] [break] ...Rajneesh.

**Bali-mardana:**
I think he's just doing exercises.

**Prabhupāda:**
Varieties of madmen. //Keśava tuyā jagata vicitra:// "O My Lord Keśava, Your creation is full of varieties." [sound of man shouting "ha" in the background] The same Rajneesh process?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...Girirāja?

**Bali-mardana:**
Well, ah, Tamāla is going [indistinct]. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The vast ocean, how it looks beautiful. There is God's creation.

**Bali-mardana:**
As far as I know, the only publicity that was made from Vṛndāvana was the letters sent to the temples.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they must have been preparing for that. Anyway... The scientist says hydrogen and oxygen is mixed into water. Who supplies so much hydrogen and oxygen?

**Bali-mardana:**
Only God. Would you say that from God's vantage point everything that happens here is not very significant?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, there are many Sikhs.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Jai. So we shall return?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Bombay also has beach. Not much cold, not much heat.

**Bali-mardana:**
They now have an apartment for you in Juhu.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That is our house.

**Bali-mardana:**
I think it is. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that is the history there is no such action.

**Devotee:**
There was one time on one of the other islands. It fell on someone, some child.

**Bali-mardana:**
Sometimes during a storm it may be loosened.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another thing.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Kṛṣṇa lets them fall in such a way that people don't get hurt. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...to grow fruit, eh? [break] ...I mean, if the fruit is green, it will never fall. Never fall. Therefore when the fruits are grown, green, take it down. But that they do not know.

**Bali-mardana:**
I don't know if they do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they do not use coconut.

**Sudāmā:**
No, they throw them away.

**Bali-mardana:**
They are not intelligent.

**Sudāmā:**
They don't know anything about //dābs.//

**Bali-mardana:**
No?

**Sudāmā:**
They think //dābs// is not good.

**Bali-mardana:**
Is that what they say?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes, //karmīs// don't like the taste.

**Prabhupāda:**
The only good thing is meat, for them. //Kadarya-bhakṣana kare. Nānā yoni brahman kare, kadarya-bhakṣana kare//

> karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa, sakale viṣera bhāṇḍa,
> amṛta baliyā yebā khāya
> nānā yoni brahman kare, kadarya-bhakṣaṇa kare
> tara janma adhaḥ paṭe jāya
> [Śrī Prema Bhakti-candrikā]

Do you understand?

**Nitāi:**
I do not follow.. I recognize //khāya. Khāya// means eating, eat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? All abominable things. Not natural products. So, did you like that preparation?

**Bali-mardana:**
Which one was that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yesterday.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, yes. It was very nice. You have taught them very well.

**Prabhupāda:**
When is Ekādaśī?

**Sudāmā:**
Saturday.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Harer nāma harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]].

**Bali-mardana:**
One thing I did not like was the bitter melon.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bali-mardana:**
I did not like the bitter melon.

**Prabhupāda:**
You did not like?

**Bali-mardana:**
It is too bitter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, it was so nice. Eh?

**Sudāmā:**
Do you like it, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. It is very beneficial for the stomach and kidney.

**Bali-mardana:**
It's like medicine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Your wife also did not like?

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, she likes it.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] Then it is all right. You are American fools, and she is Japanese. Japanese are very intelligent. Yes. Extraordinarily. They're just like Bengalis. Yes. Because mostly they eat fish. Fish is very good thing. It has got sufficient quantity of phosphorus. So brain becomes nice---for this crude work, not for fine, spiritual work.

**Bali-mardana:**
No.

**Sudāmā:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday I received a telephone call from Gopāla, and he said that in a month...

**Prabhupāda:**
Gopāla Kṛṣṇa?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja, in Tokyo.

**Bali-mardana:**
No, Gopāla Swami.

**Sudāmā:**
Gopāla Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gopāla Swami, yes.

**Sudāmā:**
And he said that within a month the Society will be registered there in Japan. That the registration is finally coming to effect.

**Satsvarūpa:**
There was also a telegram from Bhūrijana in Hong Kong.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Satsvarūpa:**
And he's fully prepared for us to come, and he's hoping that we'll come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Then prepare that. So by the twenty-eighth?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes, we'll inform him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is that all right?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall cross here or there?

**Bali-mardana:**
The car is over here. [end]
