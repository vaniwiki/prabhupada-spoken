[poor recording]

[Indian devotee reciting Sanskrit //praṇaṁ-mantras//] [break]

[01:34]

**Prabhupāda:**
Nītyānanda Prabhu.

**Gurudas:**
Is he...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Brahmacārī.//

**Gurudas:**
Is he the one who lived with you in Vṛndāvana?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Gurudas:**
There’s one Nītyānanda prabhu who lived with you in Vṛndāvana? When Puruṣottama lived with you also? One Nītyānanda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he lives in Orissa.

**Gurudas:**
Oh, I see.

**Prabhupāda:**
Near, Padampur.

**Gurudas:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has got a paper, [Hindi]

**Devotee:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
He is very sincere worker, //brahmacārī.// [break] [Hindi with guest] [break]

**Guest:**
I just purchased that //Kṛṣṇa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kṛṣṇa.//

**Guest:**
Two parts. Really wonderful. Earlier I had read one book by Pareśvaranda Hṛṣīkeśa [indistinct] about Krsna’s philosophy, ethics. So after that, I read this really most appealing and wonderful [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Our books are selling very nicely. We’re selling books for forty thousand rupees daily. That is the main standing. Our whole expenditure went there. Please cooperate with this movement.

**Guest:**
I am at your disposal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you.

**Guest:**
At your command. So you can make me for the [indistinct] documents and all that.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [break] [indistinct] ...No botheration. Just have chanting. No botheration from //Kali?// That I [indistinct]. But we cannot give you princely order. That is not possible. Simply just to maintain the body and soul together, that I can. But this is [indistinct]. Therefore I am little strict, that from constantly [indistinct] for nothings. And if there is no Deity money, then picture is there. Only the dress---put the picture. That is also Deity, is it not? Is it not? Yes. Or even in the mind. That is also Deity. Picture is also Deity. And one who cannot provide even picture, the mind is there. Just think of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma and prepare foodstuff, all kinds of foodstuff, and offer within the mind. You have not seen that picture? Yes. We are preparing //khīr,// and wanted to implore this? "Shall I give the Lord so hot? Let me see." Then he touched, his finger is burned. There is no //khīr,// [laughing] but the finger is burned. These are the instances. A devotee can offer, that serve Kṛṣṇa, so many ways, so many ways. But we should try to serve Kṛṣṇa as gorgeously as possible. But if you have no means, then other things also. Not that "We have to do it this way." No.

> patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ
> yo me bhaktyā prayacchati

The Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, have got their temple. I expected that you must have, Americans. [indistinct] But if it is not possible, then it is //patraṁ puṣpaṁ// with picture, that’s all. There is no question of stoppage. //Ahaituky apratihatā// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. Devotional service cannot be stopped in any circumstances. [Cross talk from other audio recording fades in and out until end]. So my first business is to see that somehow or other the temple is complete. Then we shall see whether there is Deity or there is dress. If in the meantime it is possible, you do. And if there is no means, then you cannot take from the construction. This is my point. Is that clear? Yes. And so far money is concerned, whatever money is there, then you’ll spend everything for temple, not for other things. Therefore I am trying to minimize as much as possible, and necessity must be there. Otherwise that money is for this Vṛndāvana, the construction and maintenance. Now I want to finish this. [long pause] So do like that. Is that all right?

**Gurudas:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Finish the construction at any cost. Your wood has come?

**Gurudas:**
Wood has come. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, so finish the temple, and I think iron will come by tomorrow or day after tomorrow. In the meantime, you’ll fix up the wood and whatever iron. Yes. You bring it. Keep account whatever Deity collection is there.

**Gurudas:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all. That money is there?

**Gurudas:**
Yes. Twenty thousand, and another ten will come when it is sent.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do it very cautiously, because after all, we are beggar. That you should consider. But if somebody comes forward, that is our business---to induce others, moneyed man. Let his money be spent. That we are doing actually. But this money what I have brought or what I have given at Bombay, this about forty //lakhs// of rupees. What I have brought from USA, that is my book. That is my..., we can say, that writing book at night and inducing these devotees: go and sell, go and sell, go and sell. In this way it is going on. This is not contribution. George has given contribution, but that is house. But nobody gives us money for it. And here also you don’t get any big contribution, except that Birla has contributed.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
Mr. Turani[?] has given four //lakhs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Given?

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
He’s given fifty thousand, and now he’ll give the balances.

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all right. So here we can..., from Bombay do that.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
But all this money, what I have brought from USA, I have sent about six //lakhs// for Māyāpur, and about fifteen //lakhs...//

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bombay. And this is also about nine //lakhs.// So?

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
Thirty //lakhs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Thirty //lakhs// of rupees. And others, I estimate forty //lakhs.// Anyway...

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, because you put some money in a trust in America.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
So there is the other ten.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ten //lakhs.// Yes. Ten //lakhs// I have put for maintenance. So why there is no work today? They’re not working?

**Devotee:**
Yes, they’re working.

**Prabhupāda:**
Working? So finish in this way. And it is not possible to bring money any more. If possible, I’ll bring. But it has given me too much strain.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
We cannot expect it, [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Too much strain. In Bombay, that, you know, how telephone after telephone, and this Mrs. Nair, this attorneys, this, that, all.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
That was amazing. You said that was the biggest battle...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
...of all.

**Prabhupāda:**
Overnight it if we want to payment. Immediately make a call, I take fifty, thirty thousand. Give immediately.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
Every night, we were going from early in the morning ’til midnight, every day practically, with meetings. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, please try to save me from all this strain. Whatever is done, done. Try to maintain it. And what is there? For Vṛndāvana, there is no anxiety. A little //roti// and rice, you’ll be able to offer to Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. There will be no difficulty. Somehow or other finish the temple and install the Deity. If it is not possible install Deity, you have got this picture there.

**Gurudas:**
I think we will make one set of clothes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do whatever you... Like that yes. So why so gorgeous? If you are short of money, the principle should be that we should request somebody; he should supply. This temple construction, we are taking responsibility. The //gosvāmīs// did not do that.

**Gurudas:**
Manasingha took.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They, one big man came that way. So many big men come. So they offer service, "What can I do?" So they prescribe according to his position. When King Manasingha came, "Yes, you can construct a very nice temple. You have got money." So they constructed. It is not that Rūpa Gosvāmī had to collect money and see the supervision. The man who came to give some service according to his position, he said, "All right, you can construct a nice temple." So he constructed that temple. [Break] We have to see how far progress is made. So far, there is no progress. What I left at that...

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
The sanctioning of the [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
No progress has been made. What I left, it is.... [break] Just to make these things more clear: the stress should be given to complete the temple as soon as possible. When the temple is complete, then ask for the Deity. Fifteen thousand is already paid, and that will be..., balance will be paid. Now, dress, if there is money, you’ll make His dress ten thousand cost. But if there is no money, then ordinary cloth will be sufficient. This is clear-cut program. Is that all right? Now go. [laughs] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
