Maya[?] Punjabi people are in Vṛndāvana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (1):**

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh yes. Māyāvādīhas now developed due to people’s atheistics temper otherwise whole India was Vaiṣṇava.

**Devotee (1):**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Vṛndāvana there are 5000 temples. Mathura there are so many temples. All big, big temples they are Vaiṣṇava temples. Tirupati, Tirumala the biggest, Jagannātha Purī..

**Devotee (1):**
Ha. Rameśvara.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rameśvara, they are all Vaiṣṇava temples.

**Devotee (1):**
And the biggest one is the Śrī Raṅgam. Śrī Raṅgam.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Śrī Raṅgam the biggest temple. So we are not going to Śrī Raṅgam, South India?

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
We are going to South India, that has not yet been fixed up by Hariprasad Badruka. I have written him..

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm... //Hari guru vaiṣṇava.. jaya...// //na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. These rascal fools they do not know wherein lies their interest of life, //svārtha-gatiṁ.// Interest, progress of interest towards Viṣṇu, //viṣṇur ārādhyate puṁsāṁ, nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. //Ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param// [Padma Purāṇa], //viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ// means Vaiṣṇava. //Viṣṇur asya devatā iti vaiṣṇava...// if you want to purchase land here, you know, they are lying vacant...

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, [chanting //japa//]...[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
The morning walk is not pleasant?

**Devotee (1):**
Very.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurudas:**
Very pleasant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone of you agree?

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone of you agree?

**Devotee (1):**
Yes Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Yes... in your country there is no morning walk? Eh? In your country there is no morning walk?

**Devotee (1):**
No, not so much.

**Devotee (2):**
Some.

**Devotee (1):**
They can only walk to the nightclubs. Night walk. Some go to walk their dogs.

**Devotees:**
[Laugh]

**Devotee (1):**
So they get up early.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, dog requires morning walk.

**Devotee (1):**
[Laughs].

**Prabhupāda:**
Not man.

**Devotees:**
[Laugh]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not morning walk that is morning evacuate. They take the dog for evacuate.

**Devotee (1):**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, [chanting //japa//] ...[pause]

**Devotee (2):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, the other night you said not to attend Vṛndāvana, ‘//The land of Vṛndāvana//’...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (2):**
Is there a list of offences, just like there is for the name?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dhāma aparādha.// The greatest offence is to live in Vṛndāvana and have illicit sex.

**Devotee (2):**
Ha.

**Prabhupāda:**
The greatest offence.. And other things also.

**Devotee (2):**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
These things are prohibited, no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat-eating.

**Devotee (2):**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
So such function is most offensive in Vṛndāvana. In other places it may be excused but here it is the greatest offence. In Vṛndāvana //dhāma// what ever you do the result is 100 times increased.

**Devotee (2):**
Ha.

**Prabhupāda:**
If you do devotional work then your devotion will be increased 100 times. In other places if you do 1% devotional that is 1%. If you do here 1% it will be 100%. Similarly if you do sinful activities 1% here, it will increase 100%. Vṛndāvana's business is to increase, so better increase your devotional service than increase your material activities. That is Vṛndāvana. Suppose if you're gambling, say 100 times increase. Which way will we shall try to 100 times? To get profit, or lose it? Hundred times loser, or 100 times gainer which is your business?

**Devotee (2):**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gainer. So, you do, ah? Even if you live for one day or two days and simply engaged in devotional service that will be 100 times increased. Therefore ordinary men is advised not to live in holy places more than three days.

**Devotee (2):**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they are accustomed to do sinful activities, ah? As soon as they become a little acclimatised then they will begin sinful activities. It is better don't live here more than three days. Go away.

**Devotee (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
For three days he can keep himself pure and then on the fourth day the impure things will be...

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, [chanting //japa//] [pause].

[break]

**Devotee (3):**
... Bulls, they also enjoy it...

**Prabhupāda:**
Okay.

**Devotee (3):**
Getting, running, chance for a walking.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see, the driver is sitting. And he is going.

**Devotee (1):**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, [chanting //japa//] Jaya!

**Prabhupāda:**
A village, bull, they are afraid of many men.

**Devotee (2):**
Ha.

**Devotee (4):**
In America they will argue that this is meant to be eaten.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (4):**
In America sometimes we are asking them, why don't you use the bull?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Devotee (4):**
They will say, no no no, this is meant to be eaten.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm. Why not your turn... [to be] eaten?

**Devotees:**
[Chuckle]

**Prabhupāda:**
Why you are afraid of being eaten? What is the reply?

**Devotee (4):**
They are baffled.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm. If the bull is to be eaten by you, then you have to be eaten by the tiger. So why do you take protection from the tiger?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Māyāpura, those bulls we have...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We have two bulls in Māyāpura...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jagāi and Mādhāi...

**Prabhupāda:**
[Laughs]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Cannot get near them. Anyone comes near them, immediately.. they.. but that is a good sign...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, healthy sign.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Because we have some small bulls...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayapatāka will not let anyone pet them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Because he says, that if you pet them then they become too much affectionate and they will not do hard work. That is for the cows.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Too much petting of bull's is not good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, spoil the child. Spare the rod, spoil the child.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[Chuckles]

**Prabhupāda:**
The rod is equal, you have seen stick in the Dallas’s school?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, your stick.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I told them, keep the stick in hand but don't beat them. Simply that is sufficient. That is sufficient and actually it is going on. You know better than...

**Satsvarupa:**
In the beginning they used it all the..

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Satsvarupa:**
They were using it a little but now they learned. They don't have to use it.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Satsvarupa:**
Just be...awesome?

**Prabhupāda:**
It should not be used, similarly as Yaśodā-māyi was doing with Kṛṣṇa. That is much.

**Satsvarupa:**
They simply carry it with them now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha. That is the old system, Kṛṣṇa was also shown the stick. Prahlāda Mahārāja, also shown. The stick. By his teacher. [Break] ...tanapaka[?] By pulling like this...

**Devotee (1):**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that professor learned that word. Ṭīkayā[?], like this.

**Devotees:**
[Laugh]

**Prabhupāda:**
So when the man was slower, dizier[?]. He said, //punkah kicho//[?], just pull on the fan. So students were taking note, they also wrote down, //punkah kicho//[?]...

**Devotees:**
[Laugh]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Laugh] after the class is over, everyone is considered what is this word, //punkah kicho? Punkah kicho?// [Laugh] so all the students went to the professor, "Sir what is this //punkah kicho?//" Then he began to laugh, you are so rascal that you do not know that I am asking the man to pull the fan. This is your Hindi word. Then they came to their senses...//punkah kicho...//

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, [chanting //japa//]...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Guru dāsa:**
He was asking about these branches, what happens to them?...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Passerby:**
Rādhe Śyāma.

**Prabhupāda:**
Jaya Rādhe.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, [chanting //japa//] ...

**Prabhupāda:**
So many policemen have come?... ... The mother herself is hungry but the cub still wants some food.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, [chanting //japa//] ...

**Prabhupāda:**
You see there is cross, it is owned by some Christian priest.

**Devotee (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He wanted to start a missionary. A Christian missionary, here. He was not successful.

**Devotee (1):**
In Vṛndāvana?

**Devotee (4):**
Maybe we should go to Bethlehem?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee (4):**
We would be successful in Bethlehem.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
See how they built around the tree? This wall, they have built around the root of the tree.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Not cutting.

**Guru dāsa:**
It is a very nice piece of land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I think we can have it, we can try.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, [chanting //japa//] [end]
