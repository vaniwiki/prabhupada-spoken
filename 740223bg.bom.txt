**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> raso 'ham apsu kaunteya
> prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ
> praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu
> śabdaḥ khe pauruṣaṁ nṛṣu
> [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]

[break] [02:59]

Translation: "O son of Kuntī, Arjuna, I am the taste of water, the light of the sun and moon, the syllable oṁ in the Vedic mantras. I am the sound in ether and ability in man."

**Prabhupāda:**

> raso 'ham apsu kaunteya
> prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ
> praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu
> śabdaḥ khe pauruṣaṁ nṛṣu
> [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]

This is all-pervasive nature of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. We should mark the important word in this verse: //aham. Aham// means the person. Kṛṣṇa never says that "I am imperson." Imperson is the feature of Kṛṣṇa. Just like in the Ninth Chapter, Kṛṣṇa says, //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. //Mayā:// "I am all-pervasive by My energy."

We have already explained that Kṛṣṇa has multi-energy. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. That is the Vedic version, that the Absolute Truth, Supreme Person, has got multi-energies. In the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// also: whatever we are experiencing, that is simply Kṛṣṇa's energy. Just like we can experience the heat and light from the sun. We can understand the constitution of the sun globe. Although we are ninety-three million miles away from the sun, but by his energy, heat and light, we can understand what is the sun. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, He has got multi-energies. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.//

> na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate
> na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate
> parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate
> svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca
> [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]

This is the version of //Upaniṣad.// He has nothing to do. //Na tasya kāryam.// Why? And because... //Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate.// Nobody is equal to Him, neither greater than Him. And He hasn't got to do anything because He has got so many energies. //Svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.// Everything is being done by His energy very perfectly.

So His energy is working even in the water. You can perceive His energy within the water. We are daily using water. We are tasting water. So you can perceive Kṛṣṇa's presence, Kṛṣṇa's all-pervasiveness, even while you drink water. Every one of us, we drink water. And... So the taste of the water, Kṛṣṇa says, "Here I am." This is impersonal feature, but the person is behind. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. Water is one of the product of this material nature, but behind this existence of water is Kṛṣṇa. Then you can understand Kṛṣṇa. You try to understand by studying His energy. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is describing that "Although you cannot see Me just now..." Because in the preliminary stage nobody can see Kṛṣṇa, although Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. He is present within the atom. But it requires the qualified eyes to see Him or purified senses to perceive Him.

That is stated in the //śāstra: ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. With our these present senses we cannot understand what is the holy, transcendental name of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore sometimes we are misunderstood, that "Why these people are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?" So... Because ordinary man or ordinary senses cannot understand the value, the nature of the name, therefore //śāstra// says, //ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi. Nāmādi:// beginning from name. We can realize God by chanting name. Because //abhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ. Nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:133|[Cc. Madhya 17.133]]]. These are the description of the //śāstras. Nāma,// the holy name of the Lord, is completely spiritual. //Nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇa.// He is... //Nāma// is..., name is as good as Kṛṣṇa. //Nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ.//

Those who are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// without any offense, they are tasting spiritual nectarine. Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī has written a //śloka// that "If I could possess millions of ears and millions of tongues, then I could enjoy what is the transcendental mellow in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// But that is not possible for ordinary human being in the beginning. Therefore //śāstra// says, //ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. These impurified senses cannot appreciate the value of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. //Nāma-ādi.// His name, His quality, His pastimes, His form, His activities... There are so many things, beginning with //nāma,// Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// As we go on chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, and as we become purified... The more we chant, we become purified. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]].

So this is the process. So those who are not even inclined to chant this holy name of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// although there is no loss and there is no expenditure... Anyone can chant. It is freely distributed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Anyone can take the chance of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Automatically... Sometimes we find friends on the street, simply by seeing us, they chant "Hare Kṛṣṇa." So that is a good sign. They are learning the value of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// So in this age the chanting of the holy name is very, very important---//kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]---for God realization.

So even if you are not inclined to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// then try to understand Kṛṣṇa in this way. This is the process given by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. You have to drink water; you cannot avoid it. So when you taste, while drinking water, anything drinking... //Apsu. Apsu// means any liquid thing. Either you drink milk or even up to..., even you drink wine, so you have got some taste in any liquid thing while drinking. So Kṛṣṇa says, //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya:// "My dear Kaunteya, Arjuna, that taste in the liquid thing which you drink or use, that is I am." Just see how it is easily can be done. Nobody is without drinking something liquid. Either Coca-Cola or water or this or that, something must be drinking. So Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the taste." So where is the difficulty of understanding Kṛṣṇa? If we cannot... They say, "Can you show me Kṛṣṇa?" All right, here is Kṛṣṇa, see. Seeing means directly perception. When I say, "Let me see what is this mango," you are seeing already. Here seeing means tasting. "Let me see the mango," that means seeing means tasting.

So we have got so many senses. And we taste different senses. We can see by eye. We can taste by the tongue. We can hear by the ear. We can smell by the nose. We can touch by the hand. So we have got all senses. And by senses we get experience. So if you try to experience Kṛṣṇa by this process, that whenever you drink something liquid and taste it very nicely, you consider, "This taste is Kṛṣṇa," is it very difficult for Kṛṣṇa realization? And because you'll remember Kṛṣṇa... Actually that taste is Kṛṣṇa. Because that water is also Kṛṣṇa. Water is Kṛṣṇa in this sense: is the energy of Kṛṣṇa. Just like fire and the heat. Heat is the energy of Kṛṣṇa. So heat and fire is not distinct. They are the same. Still, the heat is not fire. This is called //acintya-bhedābheda// philosophy, simultaneously one and different. Simultaneously. Everything. //Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:20|[SB 1.5.20]]]. It requires only realization that "Whole universe is Kṛṣṇa." //Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān.// But it appears different from Bhagavān. Actually, it is not different. You have to understand by purified senses. That is required. Unless you have got purified senses, you cannot understand. But this is the beginning: //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. You just try to understand. This //rasa...// It is said by Kṛṣṇa. It is not our manufacture. When... If I say that "The taste of water is Kṛṣṇa," that may be different. But Kṛṣṇa says, //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya.// So why not think of Kṛṣṇa?

So this thinking of Kṛṣṇa is a process of devotional service, out of the nine processes. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. So if you remember Kṛṣṇa, you advance in your spiritual life, and you become perfect //yogī.// How?

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

If you simply think, as you drink water or drink anything, the taste only... Here is the hint: "Now here is Kṛṣṇa." So you must be drinking so many times. If so many times, if you remember Kṛṣṇa, you gradually become Kṛṣṇa conscious. So simple thing it is. Kṛṣṇa is prescribing, //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. Suppose if you do not drink. So nobody there is who does not drink. Everyone drinks. The another method, //prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ.// As soon as, early in the morning, you find the sunshine, you remember, "Here is Kṛṣṇa. Here is Kṛṣṇa." Or at night, when there is no sun, there is moonlight: "Here is Kṛṣṇa." Then //praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu.// If you are a student, serious student of Vedic //mantras... Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūra...// [//Ṛg Veda-saṁhitā// 1.22.20] If you chant the Vedic //mantras... Oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyam// [//Gāyatrī-mantra//]. The //oṁkāra,// that is Kṛṣṇa. Many people are very much fond of chanting //oṁkāra.// That is also nice. That is Kṛṣṇa. But if we simply remember that "This //oṁkāra// is Kṛṣṇa," then we become perfect. Because the process is how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

So you can become Kṛṣṇa conscious while drinking any liquid or water, while seeing the sunshine, while seeing the moonshine, while, if you are a scholar, //brāhmaṇa,// advanced, while chanting the //praṇava, praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu.// Or even if you, sound, if you hear the sound---there are so many sounds going on---if you remember Kṛṣṇa. And also, //pauruṣaṁ nṛṣu. Pauruṣam.// You meet so many men in your dealings with this material world. There are many very big, big men: big, big industrialists, big, big scholars, big, big manufacturers, and big, big bankers. So this is //pauruṣam,// or who has attained perfection in the material world. So instead of envying him, if you simply think that "He has attained because he has got little power from Kṛṣṇa..." //Yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ mama tejo 'ṁśa-sambhavam// [[books:bg:10:41|[Bg. 10.41]]]. Anything wonderful that is done, that is done by any person, //pauruṣam,// that is also Kṛṣṇa's energy.

So it is not at all difficult to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. There is no expenditure; there is no loss. Simply by your daily dealings you can become Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is the program here. //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ, praṇavaḥ...// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. If you cannot chant... We are advising everyone, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//" //Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]. //Kīrtan...// This Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// should be chanted twenty-four hours. //Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.// But it becomes difficult or hackneyed, then you can remember Kṛṣṇa otherwise: while drinking water, while seeing the sunshine, while seeing the moonshine, while chanting Vedic //mantras,// or even hearing some sound in the //khe.// Sound is produced by the ether. So many sounds we are hearing. If you simply remember this //śloka// of //Bhāgavata,// that //śabda,// any sound... Hare Kṛṣṇa sound is transcendental. That's all right. But if you don't like Hare Kṛṣṇa sound, you take any sound, any sound is also... That is coming from the original sound; simply it is covered by //māyā.// What is the difference between spiritual and material? Everything is spiritual. //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.1]. But when it is covered by //māyā,// it is material. That's all. And what is //māyā?// Forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. The same water, the same water, it is spiritual, because it is Kṛṣṇa's energy. Kṛṣṇa has already said, //bhūmir āpaḥ. Āpaḥ.// Here also, //apsu.// So //āpaḥ, jala,// or water, is Kṛṣṇa's energy. How it can be different from Kṛṣṇa? So we have to deal with water in so many ways. How we can forget Kṛṣṇa?

The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the spreading the knowledge of //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. So how one can become Kṛṣṇa conscious very easily without any loss, but gain is very much---why don't you take this advantage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement? What is the reason that you'll not take? //Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. If you become Kṛṣṇa conscious in this way, the profit is very, very great. Because the more you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, the more Kṛṣṇa becomes revealed to you. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.// Realization, revelation, that... With the blunt senses you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa, you cannot realize Kṛṣṇa. But if you purify... //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. Our present senses are blunt senses because it is covered by forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa, or //māyā.// Therefore it has to be purified. Or the nature of forgetfulness has to be removed. That's all. This is the process. //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. If you follow this process, that "Here is drinking water, the taste is Kṛṣṇa," that means some percentage of your forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa is removed. Similarly, when you see the sunshine, the moonshine, or you chant //oṁkāra...// There are other, so many ways prescribed in the later verses. So try to understand Kṛṣṇa in this way. It doesn't require any advancement of education or Vedic knowledge. A simple thing.

So there is no difficulty. And as soon as it is purified... //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau// [Brs. 1.2.234]. The purification... That is //bhakti. Bhakti-mārga,// devotional service, means purifying the senses. That's all. The, at the present moment, our senses are covered by //māyā,// and this //māyā// can be moved away simply by remembering in every step Kṛṣṇa. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau.// That, that //sevonmukha,// that is the devotional service. //Jihvādau.// You simply engage your //jihvā. Jihvā// means tongue. The tasting is also tongue. Without tongue, you cannot taste. Therefore it is said, //sevonmukhe hi jihvādau:// "The beginning, beginning of purification, is to use your tongue in this devotional service." So our prescription is therefore that you use your tongue for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// and employ your tongue for tasting Kṛṣṇa's //prasādam.// It is not at all difficult. There is no need of studying, I mean, higher knowledge in the Vedic principle. That will auto..., automatically will be revealed.

Therefore it is said: //sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.// If you apply your ear only... As it is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. //Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.// Chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// or hearing of Kṛṣṇa's word... Just like you are hearing the words of //Bhagavad-gītā. Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ.// This is His own word. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.// Either you hear or you chant. Because //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam...// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. There are nine methods. So the beginning is hearing. We are opening so many centers just to give people chance to hear about Kṛṣṇa. That's all. If you simply hear about Kṛṣṇa, //śṛṇvatām,// then Kṛṣṇa becomes pleased: "Oh, now he's hearing about Me." Then what does He do? //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.// Either you understand or don't understand, it becomes a pious activities on your part. And the more you become pious, you can understand Kṛṣṇa. Because impious person... //Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam.// Impious person cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. But one who is free from impious activities, //yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām... Puṇya-karma.// This hearing is //puṇya-karma. Janānāṁ puṇya, te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]. If you simply hear. There is no... If you understand, it is very good. Even if you do not understand, the vibration of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// the reading of //Bhagavad-gītā,// simply chanting, you'll be purified. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ, hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi...// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]].

So we cannot understand what I am, what is God, what is my relationship with God, what I have to do in that rela..., we cannot understand these things because we are enwrapped in sinful activities. That is also stated in the..., here. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. So in the material world, every one of us, more or less, are //duṣkṛtinaḥ,// sinful. More or less sinful. So it is very difficult for us to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]], I have already explained. Therefore we have to take advantage of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And wherever there is a chance of hearing about Kṛṣṇa, we should take the opportunity. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And learn from the... It is not our manufacture. Kṛṣṇa says. Learn how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Simply you try to understand Kṛṣṇa in every step of life. In every step of life. They will be all explained in this chapter, how you can perceive Kṛṣṇa. The beginning is tasting. Everyone drinks water or drinks something else. So try to taste the liquid, thinking that "This taste is Kṛṣṇa." You see in the morning the light of sunshine: "Here is Kṛṣṇa." In the evening you see the moonlight: "Here is Kṛṣṇa." There is sound always, especially in a city like Bombay. It is full of sound. So whenever you hear any kind of sound---sound is the vibration of the sky---you remember: "This sound is Kṛṣṇa." //Śabdaḥ khe.// And whenever you meet any person very exalted, very extraordinarily able, you'll understand that "This ability is Kṛṣṇa's mercy, //vibhūti.//"

In this way, if you practice, and if you chant also Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// and if you hear from realized souls about Kṛṣṇa, then you gradually become advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And when you come to perfection... //Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. This Kṛṣṇa's appearance, disappearance, His activities, will be revealed to you. //Svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. When Kṛṣṇa becomes manifest, revelation, then you understand what is Kṛṣṇa, what is His activities, what is His name, what is His pastimes. Everything becomes revealed. Then you can understand perfectly. Not... We cannot understand perfectly, but so far our ability is concerned, we can understand Kṛṣṇa. And if we a little bit understand Kṛṣṇa, then our life is successful. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. Simply by little understanding Kṛṣṇa. What is that? Now, //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar...// That is the highest perfection. After giving up this body... Ordinarily, we give up this body and we accept another, //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. That we have to stop. We are trying our best to make solution of all problems of life. The real problem is //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]: birth, death, old age and disease. But if you can conquer over birth, no more birth... As it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. No more birth. "Then it is finished? I am finished?" No, you are not finished. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.// "You come to Me. You come to Me, go back to home, back to Godhead." This is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is very easy. Everyone can adopt. Why should you give up? Take it very seriously and be happy.

Thank you very much.
