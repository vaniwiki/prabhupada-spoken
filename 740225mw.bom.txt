**Prabhupāda:**
Janārdana [Hindi].

**Mr. Sar:**
His doctor. Yesterday I talked with doctor, no? That he is coming with Swāmījī?

**Devotee:**
Eh?

**Mr. Sar:**
Yesterday I talked about doctor.

**Devotee:**
Oh, yes, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dr. Patel:**
He comes from London, and he has received a telephone from him in London, when he was coming.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Dr. Patel:**
From..., in London temple of Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, many pilgrims are coming from London, all parts of Western countries., Africa.

**Dr. Patel:**
Caitanya Mahāprabhu's birthday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So you all also come.

**Dr. Patel:**
On, on...

**Prabhupāda:**
On the eighth.

**Indian man (1):**
The sixth of March.

**Dr. Patel:**
That is on the day of Holika. //Holi?// No.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Holi,// yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Māyāpur is in East Bengal?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, West Bengal. Border of East and West. [break] What these //gṛhasthas?//

**Dr. Patel:**
No, they are...

**Indian man (1):**
[indistinct]

**Dr. Patel:**
We are not going there?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Then, after Dvārakā, they are expecting us in Hyderabad by about the twenty... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. He must again become. //Sambhavāmi yuge yuge.// We must see that He comes. We are all praying secretly that "Let God come now. Enough of this time!"

**Prabhupāda:**
He has come already.

**Dr. Patel:**
That is why some people say that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
...Kalki //avatāra// is born with...

**Prabhupāda:**
Not Kalki //avatāra.// This //hari-nāma avatāra.// Yes. //Nāma-rūpe kali-kāle kṛṣṇa avatāra// [[books:cc:adi:17:22|[Cc. Ādi 17.22]]]. Kṛṣṇa, in this age, He has descended in the form of Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Nāma-rūpe kali-kāle kṛṣṇa avatāra.// The name is already there. It is being propounded all over the world.

**Indian man (1):**

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...temple.

**Dr. Patel:**
No, but I mean to say that because the temple is open you hear the noise. When the temple is closed, you won't hear the noise. That is..., that should be our argument. Because there is a next-door temple also. It also makes noise. But your noise is now louder, I mean, far away because of the open space. That should be the argument: "Let us construct a regular temple. You won't..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...so much proud of the Hindus.

**Dr. Patel:**
I'm also proud of the Hindu. Always proud.

**Prabhupāda:**
But why they disturb //maṅgala ārati?//

**Dr. Patel:**
But they may be degenerated Hindu, people may be Hindus, real Hindus, false Hindus and fictitious Hindus and non-Hindus calling themselves as Hindus. So which type of Hindus do you mean?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. I mean Hindu Hindu.

**Dr. Patel:**
A man born of Hindu //brāhmaṇas,// but may not be Hindu. These are... That man of a... [break] Why she wants it, when people are starving outside. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...follower of yours.

**Dr. Patel:**
I am follower.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are, but, I mean to say, majority.

**Dr. Patel:**
Majority, greater majority of we follow. But there is a smaller majority followers minor...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is a...

**Dr. Patel:**
Minority follow big number. That is where our question is. And come what may, you may say anything. If you open a single temple in... [break] ...ancient religion, even though they are Muslims.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Java.

**Dr. Patel:**
Java, Sumatra, the same thing. Java and Indonesia, the same thing. Java, Sumatra is called Indonesia now.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Indonesia, Jakarta I went. The Java Hindus, they gave me reception.

**Dr. Patel:**
The whole Bali island is all Hindus.

**Prabhupāda:**

**Dr. Patel:**
Hundred percent Hindus.

**Prabhupāda:**

**Dr. Patel:**
Here you see so many people sitting behind.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
This whole coast is being spoiled.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is sea, and that's a canal or a river only, small.

**Dr. Patel:**
They are that... So far as the custom hygiene is concerned, I mean, the... We have actually been teaching personal hygiene through religion. This is the only country that...

**Prabhupāda:**
But that is also hygienic. After passing stool, they are taking bath in the river. That is good hygiene.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is good hygiene.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The river is moving water, clean.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That I have seen. They are taking bath in the morning.
