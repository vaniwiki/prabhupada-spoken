Translation: "The supreme occupation, or dharma, for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self."

**Prabhupāda:**

> sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo
> yato bhaktir adhokṣaje
> ahaituky apratihatā
> yayātmā suprasīdati
> [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]

//Ātmā, ātmā// means this body, //ātmā// means the mind also, and //ātmā// means the soul and, above that, the Paramātmā, Bhagavān. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. So //yayā ātmā suprasīdati. Su// means very much. Not only //prasīdati,// but //suprasīdati,// very much. Everyone. The body becomes satisfied, the mind becomes satisfied, the soul becomes satisfied, and the Supreme Paramātmā, He also becomes satisfied. So that is called //paro dharmaḥ. Paro dharmaḥ// means... //Paraḥ// means superior, and //dharmaḥ// means occupational duty. Everyone has got occupational duty. It doesn't matter, either you are a //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa//---everyone has got occupational duty. That is human society. Human society means when the society is divided into these eight divisions: //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa. Varṇāśrama-dharma.// That is Vedic civilization.

> varṇāśramācāravatā
> puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān
> viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā
> nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]

Unless the human society comes to the standard of executing //varṇāśrama-dharma,// it is not human society; it is animal society, no regulative principles. The animals, they have no regulative principles, but human society must follow regulative principles. That is called //varṇāśrama-dharma.//

So //varṇāśrama-dharma// is also material. That is not spiritual. //Varṇāśrama-dharma// is the beginning of spiritual life. How one can come to the standard of spiritual life? It is a regulated life, when executing... The spiritual life is //viṣṇur ārādhyate panthāḥ.// When one comes to the platform of worshiping Viṣṇu, that is spiritual life. But the people, they do not know what is the aim of life, what is the goal of life. They do not know. Not only nowadays; the material world is meant like that. They have forgotten, forgotten. They are thinking, those who are too much materialistic, they are thinking that "I am this body, and satisfaction of the bodily senses is the ultimate goal of my life." But that is not the goal of life. The goal of life is to find out the ways and means how to satisfy the Supreme Lord.

That is also stated in this chapter, //ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ...// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. This meeting was presided by Sūta Gosvāmī, and there were many learned //brāhmaṇas,// learned scholars, sages. Therefore he was addressing the audience, //dvija-śreṣṭhāḥ. Dvija// means twice-born: first birth by the father and mother, and the second birth by //saṁskāra,// or by culture. //Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,// they have got //saṁskāra. Śūdras// have no //saṁskāra. Saṁskāra-varjita// means //śūdra.// In this age nobody observes the //saṁskāras.// Therefore in the //śāstra// it is said, //kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ// [//Skanda Purāṇa//]. In the Kali-yuga almost every person is a //śūdra.// Therefore there is so much chaos. The government is managed by the //śūdras// or less than //śūdras, mleccha. Mleccha-rājendra-rūpiṇaḥ// [SB 12.1.40]. //Mlecchas// have taken the post of government. It is meant for the //kṣatriyas,// means qualified //kṣatriya,// very brave, very powerful, very charitable, not going away when there is fight. That is //kṣatriya's// position. //Brāhmaṇa// means //satyaṁ śamo damas titikṣā// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. So people should be trained up as //brāhmaṇa,// as //kṣatriya,// as //vaiśya. Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. The //vaiśya//'s duty is to produce food grains, agriculture, and give protection to the cows, and if you have got surplus foodstuff, you can make trade where there is shortage.

So actually this statement of the //śāstras,// that //kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ// [//Skanda Purāṇa//], hardly there is //brāhmaṇa// or //kṣatriya// or //vaiśya,// because nobody is doing their duty. Instead of producing food grains, //vaiśyas// are engaged in running on big, big factories. So factory cannot produce food grains. Therefore there is food shortage or people are not getting ample foodstuff, they are starving, and there must be agitation. There is no //brāhmaṇa's// guidance, there is no //kṣatriya// kings, and //śūdras// are also not executing their duty. Then what will be the result? This is the result. This is the result. Therefore this is material //dharma. Ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. That //vibhāga,// or division, must be there. Otherwise there must be chaos. Just like in your body there is division: the brain division, here the brain division, the arms division, and the belly division and the leg division. So these divisions are required. If you have no brain, then how you can control your other senses? If you have no strength in your arms, how can you protect yourself? If you have no digestive power, there is no food, how you live? And if there is no leg, or the laborer class, how you will walk? This is natural division. Therefore //varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ,// the //varṇāśrama// division must be there. That is human society.

Everything is described very nicely in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ. Parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ,// and //yajñād bhavati parjanyo yajñaḥ karma...// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. [break] And the animals, as soon as they are fatty and grown up, they are sent to the slaughterhouse. This business is going on. So why there should not be crisis in food grain and crisis in human...? There must be. Because we are not abiding by the orders of the Supreme Lord, and //dharma// means to abide by the orders of the Supreme Lord. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. You cannot manufacture //dharma:// "This is this religion; this is that religion." These are all bogus. Real //dharma// is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is //dharma.// All bogus type of //dharma//---Hindu religion, Muslim religion, this religion, that religion---they are not //dharma.//

Therefore it is said here, //sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. //Paraḥ// means Supreme. What is that? //Yato bhaktir adhokṣaje,// "Wherein this is taught, 'Just surrender to the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa,' that is first-class religion." All other religions, they are bogus. That is not religion. Just like good citizenship means to abide by the laws of the state, of the government. That is good citizenship. Similarly, a real religious person means who is abiding by the orders of the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, they have no information of the Supreme Lord. Although the Lord, the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa, is present, still, they are thinking that Supreme Lord is //nirākāra. Nirākāra// means to avoid. How Supreme God can be //nirākāra?// If the Supreme Lord is the supreme father... We have got experience: I am a person, my father is person, his father is person, his father is person... In this way, if you go to the topmost platform to find out the Supreme Person or Supreme God, why He should be imperson? Imperson is a feature of the Supreme Person, but ultimately //brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]], ultimately the Absolute Truth is a Supreme Person. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. This is the Vedic information, that as we are all //nityas,// eternal, we are also living being, but there is another supreme //nitya,// eternal, and supreme //cetana,// or living being, and that is God. That is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "There is no more superior living being than Me." That is Kṛṣṇa.

So here it is said, //sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ. Dharma...// You have to execute your occupational duty, but, as Kṛṣṇa said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. That is real //dharma.// "I am this. I am following this //dharma,// that //dharma//"---that is not //dharma. Dharma// means the natural instinct. The natural instinct is to obey the superior person. Every one of us, we are meant for obeying the Supreme. Is anyone... Who can say that "I haven't got to obey any superior person"? Is there anyone? That cannot be. You have to obey. That was the subject matter of my topics in Moscow, with Professor Kotovsky. I challenged him that "What is the difference between your philosophy and our philosophy? You have to obey some person, and I have to obey some person. So you are obeying Lenin, and I am obeying Kṛṣṇa. So where is the difference between you and me in philosophy? Now, the things remain to be judged, whether by following Kṛṣṇa I shall be happy or by following Lenin you shall be happy. That is to be judged, not that you, Communist party, you can do without following a superior person. That you cannot do. That is not possible." That is natural. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. Our real formation, constitutional position, is to obey the orders of Kṛṣṇa. But we have selected disobeying Kṛṣṇa. We are obeying Lenin. That is the difficulty. We have to obey somebody, but you have selected not to obey Kṛṣṇa but to obey Lenin. In India disobedience is very prominent now. But in that way you shall not be happy. Therefore //Bhāgavata// says, //sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaja// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. If you learn how to obey the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, then you will be happy. //Yayātmā suprasīdati.// This is fact.

So unless people take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness and understand and learn how to obey Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they cannot..., there cannot be any peace. There cannot be any happiness. And there is no condition... Here it is said, //ahaituky apratihatā.// That obedience should be without any motive. Just like see here the Europeans and American boys, they are obeying Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative without any condition. They have not come here to obey my order for earning livelihood or for some material purpose. They have not come for that. They have got enough money. They have got enough money. They can purchase hundred times India. But why? This is real //paro dharmaḥ.// This is the supreme religion, to obey the Supreme Personality of Godhead or His representative. Because we have to learn through the representative of Kṛṣṇa. //Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit, na martya-buddhyāsūyeta// [SB 11.17.27]. So this is the injunction of the //śāstra. Ācārya,// the spiritual master, the representative of Kṛṣṇa... //Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyāt,// Kṛṣṇa says. "The //ācārya// is Myself." //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ:// "By pleasing the //ācārya,// one can please the Supreme Lord." This is the... //Ācāryavān puruṣo veda:// "One who has got //ācārya// to guide him, he knows things." These are the Vedic injunctions.

> tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet
> samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham
> [MU 1.2.12]

So therefore it is said here that //ahaituky apratihatā.// Do not approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead for some material benefit. That is not pure devotion. Pure devotion means it should be without any motive and it cannot be checked. It cannot be checked. There may be so many hindrances. But one who is pure devotee, his business cannot be stopped. Therefore it is called //ahaituky apratihatā.// And when one comes to that stage, then //ātmā suprasīdati.// The example is vivid. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. Dhruva Mahārāja was insulted by his stepmother, and therefore he wanted, according to the instruction of his mother, to pray to God to retaliate the insult of stepmother. And he went to the forest and meditated and practiced how to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Within six months he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But when he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he was fully satisfied. He said that //kācaṁ vicinvann api divya-ratnam:// "Sir, I came to search out some particles of glass. Now I have got //divya-ratna,// a valuable jewel or gem." //Kācaṁ vicinvann api divya-ratnaṁ svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]].

This is the satisfaction. We are searching after so many things to become satisfied, but if we try to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead---that we do not know---and without any motive---it cannot be checked---then //yayātmā suprasīdati.// If you want really peace of mind, then you search out Kṛṣṇa and surrender unto Him. Where is the difficulty? Kṛṣṇa personally canvassing you, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Still, you are not... You are so fool. //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.// He is giving assurance that "I shall give you protection from all sinful reaction." We are suffering in this material world because we are continually making our life in sinful activities. Sinful activities means gratifying the senses. That is also warned by Mahārāja Ṛṣabhadeva to His sons. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]: "These rascals, they, simply for sense gratification, committing all types of sinful activities." Just like Kṛṣṇa has given us so many things to eat, but still, we shall kill animals. Still for this satisfaction of the tongue, we shall kill so many..., slaughterhouse, regular slaughterhouse. And you want to be happy. Your whole life is full of sinful activities, and you want to be happy? That is not possible.

Therefore it is said that if you develop love for Kṛṣṇa... That development cannot be possible if you are sinful.

> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

//Kṛṣṇa-bhajana// is not so easy thing. //Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam:// one who has surpassed all the sinful activities. //Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam.// How we can avoid sinful activity? Sinful activities you can avoid, //puṇya-karmaṇām,// by discharging //puṇya-karma,// pious activities. And what is the pious activities? Simple pious activities. Simple pious activities is //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ. Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.// If you simply hear about Kṛṣṇa, that is pious activities. You are sitting here patiently; you are not going out. This is acquiring pious activities, result of pious activities. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ, hṛdy antaḥ-sthaḥ..// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. Pious activities means to cleanse the heart. Because our heart is overloaded with so many sinful activities, therefore we are suffering. So by hearing, //satāṁ prasaṅgāt// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]], by hearing from the realized soul, by hearing the //Bhagavad-gītā, Bhāgavata,// as it is, your heart will be cleansed.

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi...
> [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]

//Abhadrāṇi// means //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// Even //sattva-guṇa// is also mixed with //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// But if you hear about Kṛṣṇa... We are opening all over the world hundreds of centers. Why? We are giving chance to the people to hear about Kṛṣṇa. It is not a business center, not a business branch-out, but... //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. Here the school of teaching people how to hear about Kṛṣṇa, how to chant about Kṛṣṇa, how to worship Kṛṣṇa, the Deity... //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam, arcanam.// This is //arcanam. Vandanam,// to offer prayers; //dāsyam,// to work for Kṛṣṇa. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam, arcanaṁ vandanam. Sakhyam,// to make Kṛṣṇa as friend. Kṛṣṇa can be served in so many ways. Kṛṣṇa is so kind friend, even practically. We had a very big struggle in Bombay for our land. So they wanted to break our temple to drive away. It was a great commotion. All Bombay people know it. But I prayed simply Kṛṣṇa, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, anyway, You have come here. You have sat down here. It will be great insult if You are removed from this place." So Kṛṣṇa heard it, and we won the battle. Now the land is ours. The land is ours. It was a great battle.

So Kṛṣṇa is so kind. So the devotees see like that, that a Pūtanā //rākṣasī// wanted to kill Kṛṣṇa, but she got the promotion just like His Mother Yaśodā. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. Because Kṛṣṇa took it that "Although this //rākṣasī// came to kill Me with poison in her breast, but I have sucked her breast. She has become My mother." So Kṛṣṇa takes only the bright side of your devotional service. He never takes the dark side. Because anyone in this material world, he has got only dark life. So try to serve Kṛṣṇa. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]]: "Even little service rendered to Kṛṣṇa can save you from the greatest dangerous life." These are the instructions.

So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is simply to teach people how to love Kṛṣṇa, how to become beloved of Kṛṣṇa. //Sa vai puṁsām,// the greatest type of religious life. //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ.// Because we are teaching how to love Kṛṣṇa. And if you can, if we, you or we, if we some way or other, if we love Kṛṣṇa, then our life is successful. //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]], //ahaitukī...// But there must not be any motive. And it cannot be checked in any circumstances. It is not that because one is very poor man, he cannot love Kṛṣṇa, or because one is very rich man, he cannot love Kṛṣṇa. Of course, sometimes to become very rich, //janmaiśvarya// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]], they become very proud. They do not come to Kṛṣṇa. So sometimes Kṛṣṇa shows the mercy to turn His devotee into poverty-stricken position. //Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ// [SB 10.88.8]. That... Therefore somebody is afraid of coming to Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa is also very kind. When you become actually a devotee, //yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham// [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]], there will be no scarcity. Whatever you want, it will come. It will come.

So this is the position. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching, educating, all over the world. There is no distinction. There is no distinction. Don't think that "These Europeans, Americans, they are //mlecchas// and //yavanas.// They cannot take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is only meant for the //brāhmaṇas// or //kṣatriyas.//" They are //brāhmaṇa. Caṇḍālo 'pi dvija-śreṣṭho hari-bhakti-parāyaṇaḥ.// Anyone who becomes a devotee, he is better than a //brāhmaṇa.// Kṛṣṇa says, //māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. It doesn't matter wherever he is born. //Pāpa-yonayaḥ. Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.// So Kṛṣṇa is open for everyone. And He is father of all forms of life. //Sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. He is neither Indian nor Hindu nor Muslim. He is Kṛṣṇa. He is Supreme Person. So our only request is that you try to love Kṛṣṇa. Then your religious life will be perfect. //Yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. Adhokṣaje, He is beyond the sense perception, //akṣaja. Akṣaja-jñāna// means sensual perception. He is beyond that, transcendental. But you have to love.

So this loving process is the devotional service. First of all... [break] ...try to hear about Kṛṣṇa from //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. Don't malinterpret by your whimsical way. Then you will lose the opportunity. Don't follow these rascals who interpret //Bhagavad-gītā.// There is no question of interpretation. Take //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Accept that. And the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta kaṛacā// says, //kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya// [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]]: "Simply by serving Kṛṣṇa you do all of your other duties." So such a nice thing, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Take it very seriously and do the needful.

Thank you very much. [end]
