**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

Translation: "Let me first offer my respectful obeisances unto Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is the ultimate goal of life for one bereft of all possessions in this material world and is the only meaning for one advancing in spiritual life. Thus let me write about His magnanimous contribution of devotional service in love of God."

**Prabhupāda:**

> agaty-eka-gatiṁ natvā

So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu... This is the place of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, appearance site of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śrīdhāma Māyāpur. So in this place this is the appropriate literature, //Śrī-Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// We may try to discuss during these holy days. Last year some gentleman suggested, after seeing my all literatures, that "You kindly write a translation of //Śrī-Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//" He thought that this business I can do very nicely. So I took the initiation from this gentleman and began to write. Now it is almost complete. I am now translating //Madhya-līlā,// Twentieth Chapter, the discussion, "//sanātana-śikṣā.//" So it is estimated that ten volumes like this... [aside:] You think like that?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ten volumes like this, that will complete //Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is the postgraduate study of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The //Bhagavad-gītā// is the A-B-C-D to entrance, and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the graduate study, and //Śrī-Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is the postgraduate study of spiritual life. My Guru Mahārāja, His Divine Grace Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, whenever he got some time he used to read //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// And he predicted that the whole world like to read //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// and for this reason they'll learn Bengali. Therefore, following his footsteps, I have kept the Bengali character and tried to give the literary meaning of each word of the Bengali poem. This is, of course, Sanskrit. This book is full of Sanskrit verses. Some of them are composed by the author himself, Kavirāja Gosvāmī, and some of them are quoted from various literature, Vedic literature.

So the author is accepting Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //agaty-eka-gatim. Agati. Agati// means... //Gati// means movement, and //gati// means also destination. So //agati.// At the present moment, especially in this age of Kali, people are not moving. Moving means... We are moving. This moving is not very good. Moving means material movement. Moving... We are not... Not that we are not moving, but we are moving, but //agati//---we do not know what is the destination of the movement in this age. The trees are not moving, but we are moving. But that movement has not very much improved our condition. Real movement means to go forward to reach the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: na te viduḥ svārtha-gatim. Svārtha-gatim// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. This //gatim// again. As it is said //gatim,// the same word is used in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, svārtha-gatim.// Why one should move? Unless one knows the destination, the goal of life, why one should move forward?

So at the present moment they are moving, but they do not know which side they should move. That is the defect of this age, Kali-yuga. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayaḥ..., sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. Because they are moving, but not very rapidly... The real purpose of movement is //svārtha-gatim,// Viṣṇu. That they do not know. They do not know. The materialistic world, at the present moment, that they do not know that where the movement should terminate, where is the destination. That they do not know. //Na te svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum. Na te viduḥ. Na te.// Not only in this age; that is the state of material life. Those who are passing in materialistic way of life, they are thinking that sense gratification is the ultimate goal of life, //indriya-prītaye. Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ.// They have become mad, //pramattaḥ. Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma.// Movement means we are doing something, not inactive, just like stone. [break] ...but we are doing something. That is called movement. But what kinds of activities we are doing? Because we are madness---we are mad after sense gratification... //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma. Vikarma// means things which we should not do. //Karma// means prescribed duties, and //vikarma// means actions which are not prescribed---whimsical, simply for sense gratification. That is called //vikarma. Karma, vikarma, akarma.// That is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā.//

So //nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma.// Why? //Yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. //Indriya-prītaye// means for satisfaction of the senses. In the Kali-yuga, for satisfaction of the senses one can do anything, any, I mean, horrible thing, abominable thing. That is called rascaldom. They do not know what to do. So Ṛṣabhadeva says this is not good. If simply for sense gratification you are acting so whimsically, as you like, as you please, this process of activities, or //gati,// is not good. //Na sādhu manye,// Ṛṣabhadeva says, "Oh, it is not good." Why it is not good? Now, //yata...// "Because, you just try to understand, you have got this body on account of your past misdeeds, this body, this material body." These rascals, they do not know. They think that "If I get a body of a king or a rich man, that is my success." But that is not success, because you may get a king's body or very exalted body this life, but you have to change this body. That is..., you will be forced. Suppose you are very in exalted position---you are minister or king or some---but you'll not be allowed to stay. But these foolish persons, they do not know. They do not try to understand that "What is my next position?" Therefore they are called mad. //Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vi...// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]] Madman doing, he does not know what is the ultimate goal because they do not know that there is life after death. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. They do not know that. Therefore they are mad after this sense gratification.

Therefore Ṛṣabhadeva says that //na sādhu manye.// He was instructing His sons, "My dear boys, this kind of life, irresponsible life, to do anything and everything for sense gratification, is not very good." Why? "Now, because you are creating another body." You have already got experience of this body. It is full of miseries, //adhyātmikā, adhi..., adhibhautika,// three kinds of miserable condition of life. Beyond that, there is ultimate miseries: //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. But they are so rascals, they do not know how death taking place, what is after death, what is //mṛtyu,// what is death, what is birth, what is disease, whether they can be cured, when one can be free from all these troubles. They do not bother.

Therefore in this age it is said that,

> prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ
> kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ
> mandāḥ sumanda-matayo
> manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ
> [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]

Especially in this age the people are //manda-bhāgyā,// unfortunate. We have got so much assets to know from the Vedic literature, but they are so unfortunate, they do not take advantage. They do not take advantage. //Manda, manda. Manda,// slow; and //manda-bhāgyā. Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo.// They'll read so many bogus literature to waste their time, but they'll not take to the Vedic literature, even the simple book, //Bhagavad-gītā,// wherein everything is very nicely described, how we should lead our life, how we should utilize the benefit of human life. Everything is described there, but they are //manda.// They will take interpretation of a rascal of //Bhagavad-gītā. Sumanda-matayo.// Even they read //Bhagavad-gītā,// they will read some rascaldom. //Sumanda-matayo.// The Māyāvādī philosophy, they will take it, not Kṛṣṇa's philosophy. They are reading //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa's book, but interpreting in the Māyāvādīc way. Therefore //sumanda-matayo.// Their intelligence is very bad. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. And the unfortunate. In India there are so many Vedic literatures, full of treasure house of transcendental knowledge. But //manda-bhāgyās,// they will read Lenin's literature. Just see how much unfortunate they have become. As if Lenin can speak more than Kṛṣṇa. This is going on. //Manda...// Not only here, everywhere, all the parts of the world, they are //manda-bhāgyā. Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. At the same time, they are disturbed by so many conditions. Just like at the present moment there is no rice, no wheat, no food. The agitation is... //Manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ. Upadrutāḥ.// They must be disturbed, because they have not taken the right path.

Therefore, it is concluded here by the author, //agaty-eka-gatiṁ natvā// [[books:cc:adi:7:1|[Cc. Ādi 7.1]]]. If we take the path of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then---we are embarrassed in so many ways---we can get the light. We can get the light. We can reform our life. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching is so nice. Of course, the great author Kavirāja Gosvāmī has depicted the activities and teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and this Māyāpur is the birth site of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Five hundred years..., 488 years ago, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu traveled on this street. Now, still, that memory is going to be revived by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world because Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted this.

> pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma
> sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma
> [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]

So His prediction is coming to be true. [child making noise] [aside:] Who is talking? His prediction is coming to be true. Now you European and American, African and Australian, so many, all parts of the world, you have come. This is due to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's desire. He wanted it. //Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]. He wanted to be famous, to become famous, and people should thank Him. He wanted that. He told that, that "When they will know My philosophy"---that is the desire of Śrī Caitanya---"they'll thank Me." And actually you are already thanking Him by getting the sublime instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. What is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction. It is the same instruction as Kṛṣṇa gave. Kṛṣṇa wanted //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. That is Kṛṣṇa's mission. Because it is the duty of the living entity, because they are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, it is the duty of everyone to abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa. That is the duty. //Jīvera svarūpa haya nityera...// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]]. This is the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Kṛṣṇa wanted that you should all surrender unto Kṛṣṇa, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that your real constitution position is eternal servitude of Kṛṣṇa.

There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's instruction and Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction, because He is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Rūpa Gosvāmī said, //namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te. Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. Here is also said, //vadānyatā. Prema-bhakti-vadānyatā. Vadānyatā.// So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu... //Vadānya// means most magnanimous. People could not understand Kṛṣṇa. Although He advised personally in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], they are so rascal---//avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]---they thought that "Kṛṣṇa is ordinary person, maybe little learned or little powerful." But they did not take up Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Even big, big authors, scholars, they cannot understand. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu---He is Kṛṣṇa Himself---came again to teach us Kṛṣṇa consciousness for our benefit. Therefore He is //mahā-vadānyāvatāra.// So if we want to understand Kṛṣṇa, we must try to understand Kṛṣṇa through Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then it will be very easy to understand. Other people, they do not try to understand Kṛṣṇa through Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They try to understand Kṛṣṇa directly; therefore they fail to understand. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. //Yatatām api siddhānām.// So Kṛṣṇa cannot be understood by ordinary way. Kṛṣṇa can be understood only through one way, not many ways. What is that one way? //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. Only //bhakti.// So that //bhakti,// here is it said, //prema-bhakti-vadānyatā.// This //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is...

[break] //...vṛndāvanam,// and as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught us personally, going to Vṛndāvana and asking His disciple, Rūpa-Sanātana, to exhibit it and manifest the glories of Vṛndāvana. So in Vṛndāvana the Gosvāmīs constructed temples. The present city is due to these Gosvāmīs, or Śrī Caitanya. Present city of Vṛndāvana, or present importance of Vṛndāvana, is due to Śrī Caitanya. Otherwise people forgot it. It was lying vacant, a big tract of land only. But these Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, enunciated by..., initiated by Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī... Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that,

> rūpa raghunātha pade haibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bhujaba sei yugala-pīriti
> [Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura]

Vṛndāvana means Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa's activities, pastimes. So that is the destiny of life. That is the real goal. As Śrī Caitanya..., Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, that //manuṣya janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā, jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu.// One who has got this human form of life, if he does not understand what is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, his life is spoiled. //Jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu:// knowingly they're eating poison. Because by coming in contact with Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa they can go back to home, back to Godhead, and there will be no more //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. Such opportunity is human life, simply to understand Rādhā Kṛṣṇa. And therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is //mahā-vadānyāvatāra,// because He is teaching about the love of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and teaching everyone //kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te,// real destination of life, how to achieve //kṛṣṇa-prema,// and He's personally teaching. //Namo mahā-vadānyāya.// Rūpa Gosvāmī understood it: "Here is //namo mahā-vadānyāya,// most magnanimous incarnation."

Similarly, Locana dāsa Ṭhākura has sung,

> parama karuṇa, pahū dui-jana,
> nitāi-gauracandra
> saba avatāra, sāra śiromaṇi,
> kevala ānanda-kanda

//Kevala ānanda-kanda, parama-karuṇa:// "There are many incarnation, but no better incarnation, no magnanimous incarnation, like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu." Nityānanda Prabhu is always... //Vrajenda-nandana yei, śaci-suta haila sei, balarāma haila nitāi.// Nitāi-Gaura means... Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who was formerly Kṛṣṇa... He's Kṛṣṇa still. Just for our understanding... As we think that "I had my former life"---actually I had---but that former life is finished; I am now a new life. But in case of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is not like that. It is simultaneously existing. Kṛṣṇa is also existing, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also existing. The example is given in this connection, just like the sun. Now it is not visible in India, the sun. But other part, in America, it is visible. So sun is there, but it is not visible at the present moment in India. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is there, Caitanya Mahāprabhu is there, Their pastimes are there---it is going on, but it is now not visible in this part of the universe. There are innumerable universes, so by rotation Kṛṣṇa or Caitanya Mahāprabhu comes to a particular universe at a certain period. Just like the sun will rise again, tomorrow morning, at 6 p.m..., at 6 a.m.; similarly, Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa and all His incarnation, they are rotating regularly. That is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā://

> rāmādi-mūrtiṣu-kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan
> nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu
> kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.39]

So Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha and innumerable incarnation... These incarnation have been compared just like the flow of waves. If you sit down on the riverside or on the oceanside, if you want to count how many waves are there, it is impossible. They are coming regularly, day and night; that is not possible. Similarly, how many incarnations are there, it is impossible for us. Our knowledge is not so unlimited. Therefore we cannot understand. So in this way incarnations are coming.

So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the topmost incarnation.

> parama karuṇa, pahū dui-jana,
> nitāi-gauracandra
> saba avatāra, sāra śiromaṇi,
> kevala ānanda-kanda
> [Locana dāsa Ṭhākura]

//Saba avatāra, sāra śiromaṇi.// There are many incarnations, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is the most magnanimous incarnation, because in other incarnation... Just like Lord Rāmacandra. The culprit, the criminal or the sinful demon, Rāvaṇa, he was killed. Kṛṣṇa also, when He appeared, He killed so many demons. But Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, demons like Jagāi and Mādhāi, did not kill them but delivered them to become the best type of Vaiṣṇava. This is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's incarnation magnanimity. What He will kill? These demons are petty demons. They can be killed only by slap. So it is not very difficult to kill them, to call for //sudarśana-cakra// or any deadly weapon. They are already killed. There is no food. How they will work? How they will fight? So it is not possible. So it is to kill the dead man. Now, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu incarnation, if they want to kill them, they are already dead. To give them life again is Kṛṣṇa's or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's special gift. Therefore it is said, //śrī caitanya, prema-bhakti-vadānyatā// [[books:cc:adi:7:1|[Cc. Ādi 7.1]]], His magnanimity. He delivered by His personal example Jagāi-Mādhāi. And Jagāi-Mādhāi, they were born in nice //brāhmaṇa// family, rich family, but they were drunkard and meat-eaters and woman-hunters. That is their fault. And for this purpose they can do anything and everything. They were doing that. So the whole world is now all drunkard and woman-hunter, meat-eater. Especially in India, although it was unknown, now the government is teaching how to drink wine, how to eat beef and how to... This is going on.

So now the whole world is full of Jagāi-Mādhāis. That is a fact. Now, by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they can be delivered. How they can be delivered? That is being instructed by the author, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, by personally behaving. //Agaty-eka-gatiṁ natvā hīnārthādhika-sādhakam// [[books:cc:adi:7:1|[Cc. Ādi 7.1]]]. //Hīnārtha,// those who are dispossessed of all good qualities. //Hīnārtha. Artha. Artha// means possession, money. //Artha, anartha// and //paramārtha.// So //paramārtha...// There is no question of //paramārtha.// Even they have no //artha,// ordinary riches, all poor men. You see in the street, not only... Here, of course, we are poor country, but in your country also, they are also hippies. Unnecessarily they have become poor. Here, by circumstantially they have become poor like wretched person, loitering in the street. Now, while I was coming and I was thinking that formerly, when we used to go through the street, we could see so many nice confectioners shop. But at the time here there is a tea shop. Tea shop and dry loaf, that's all. You cannot get any good food---no more //kachorīs, śṛṅgāra, rasagullā,// no more. Finished, all finished. Therefore //hīnārtha, hīnārtha.// They are very, very poor. They cannot pay, even there is such shop. Still there are such shop like Dvārakā, what is, Dhari Ghosa and Bhinna, but they can be taken advantage of, a few people, a few richer section. But formerly even a poor man could eat nice food from purchasing from the confectioner. But daily, daily they are becoming poorer, poorer. //Hīna artha. Hīna// means devoid of //artha,// money. So that is another qualification. Another qualification means those who are poorer, they can take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness very easily. The richer section, they are very proud that "We have got money." But in India even richer section, they were devotees, and still they are devotees, but mostly people, they have become //hīna artha,// without any money. So for them this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very, very easy. Take advantage of it. Take advantage of it. //Hīnārthādhika-sādhakam. Adhika// means greater. //Adhika-sādhakam. Śrī-caitanya likhyate asya prema-bhakti-vadānyatā.//

Therefore Śrī Kavirāja Gosvāmī is attempting to describe about the magnanimity of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's birth site is there, and the annual 488th birth anniversary is going to be held on the 8th March. So I am very glad. I welcome you from all countries. You have taken so much labor to come here. Take advantage of the teachings of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu described by the fittest author, Kavirāja Gosvāmī, and we have tried to translate it as far as possible. Let us discuss.

Thank you very much.
