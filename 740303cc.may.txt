**Prabhupāda:**

> vadanti tat tattva-vidas
> tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam
> brahmeti paramātmeti
> bhagavān iti śabdyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]

Knowledge means //tattva-jñāna,// to know the Absolute Truth. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also... [aside:] They are making noise. Hmm ...Kṛṣṇa says,

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid māṁ vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

Everything should be understood in truth. So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to understand the Absolute Truth. So in another place Kṛṣṇa says, //janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]: anyone who understands the Absolute Truth factually as He is, not by mental speculation, but by the //paramparā// system... So therefore, the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is beginning with //guru, pūrve gurv-ādi// [[books:cc:adi:7:3|[Cc. Ādi 7.3]]]. Beginning is the //guru,// the spiritual master, because he is the representative of the //paramparā// system, disciplic succession. Therefore, whatever we do, we must first of all try to understand from //guru.//

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī also says in his //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu, ādau gurvāśrayam:// the beginning of spiritual life is to accept the bona fide spiritual master. //Sad-dharma pṛcchāt// [Brs. 1.1.74]. Then inquiry from the spiritual master. The approach should be by full surrender. //Tad viddhi praṇipātena, tattvam, etad viddhi// [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]. By //praṇipātena. Prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa nipātam.// Just like we have learned how to offer obeisances to the spiritual master, to the //gurus,// falling down flat, //praṇipā,// no reservation, falling flat---that is called //praṇipā//---so one has to approach the spiritual master. That is the Vedic injunction. //Tad vijñānārtham. Tad// means //tattva.// In order to understand the //tattva,// the Absolute Truth, //vijñāna... Vijñāna// means practical science, not theoretical. Theoretical is //jñāna.// When that is practically applied in life, that is called //vijñānam.// In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// therefore, the statement is there: //jñānaṁ me paramaṁ guhyaṁ yad vijñāna-samanvitam// [//Bhāgavata//]. //Jñāna// and //vijñāna.//

So we are very much proud of seeing things. Somebody says, "Can you show me God?" But just try to understand what is the power of our eyes. Now there is no light, so our seeing power is vanished. In this way, all the powers of our senses are conditional. Under certain condition we can see, under certain condition we can hear. Therefore at the present moment our life is conditional. We act, we see, we walk, we hear, we smell, we touch---under certain condition. Just like I have got my eyes. Because my sight power is less, so I take the condition of a glass and try to see. Similarly, this material condition is like that. Spiritually, we have got the power of seeing, the power of hearing, the power of speaking, the power of touching, power of smelling, but because we are covered by this material body, all these powers have become conditional, not absolute. So those who are inquisitive to understand the absolute life, or spiritual life, he must accept a //guru.// Therefore //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// says //pūrve,// "in the beginning." //Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.// If we actually are serious to understand the Absolute Truth, then one must have the shelter of //ācārya. Ācāryavān.// This //vān// word is used when one possesses. //Asthate bato prata//[?]. So when one possesses the shelter of //ācārya,// then his knowledge is perfect.

So the beginning of spiritual life... [aside:] Oh? He doesn't require hearing? The beginning of life is //gurvāśrayam, ādau gurvāśrayam.// That is the beginning---every //śāstra,// every Vedic scripture. Just like Kṛṣṇa, He is the original spiritual master. //Tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Ya.// Brahmā, Brahmā is the first living creature within this universe. So he was also enlightened and educated by the Supreme Lord. Not that because he's Brahmā he's independent. Nobody is independent. Knowledge must be received from the authority, and the supreme authority is Kṛṣṇa. //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.//

So here //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is the teachings of Lord Caitanya and His life, practical life. He's Kṛṣṇa, and He's personally speaking. Kṛṣṇa first of all spoke about Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// but foolish persons, //mūḍha... Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. So Kṛṣṇa was misunderstood. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. People misunderstood. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His five opulences---Himself, His expansion, His incarnation, His energy, personal energy and marginal energy... There is no association of the external energy, as it is said here, that //guru-tattva-kahiyāchi, ebe pāñcera vicāra// [[books:cc:adi:7:3|[Cc. Ādi 7.3]]]. //Guru-tattva// is also along with Him. He's also representative of the Supreme Lord. //Acāryāṁ māṁ vijānīyān// [SB 11.17.27].

So, that //guru-tattva// has been explained by the author, Kavirāja Gosvāmī, in five chapters..., six chapters, and the seventh chapter he's describing the five //tattvas. Īśa-prakāśa.// Nityānanda Prabhu is the direct manifestation of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa. //Vrajendra-nandana yei śacī-suta hoila sei balarāma hoila nitāi// [Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura]. So Nityānanda Prabhu is the first expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa or Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya// [//Caitanya Bhāgavata//]. When you speak of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, we should understand immediately that He's Kṛṣṇa in Rādhā's attitude, //rādhā-bhāva.// Kṛṣṇa, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, They are one; They are not different. //Rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. Rādhārāṇī is expansion of Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. So Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, but the pleasure potency of Kṛṣṇa is prominent in His activities. Because Kṛṣṇa, in order to understand Himself, He took the position of Rādhārāṇī to understand Himself. Personally He could not understand His potencies, but when He appeared as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu in the attitude of Rādhārāṇī's love for Kṛṣṇa, //kṛṣṇa-prema,// then He could fully understand Him. These are very intricate subject matter to understand, but this is the fact.

So, as Kṛṣṇa expands Himself by His omnipotencies... //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. Kṛṣṇa has got multi-potencies---we cannot imagine---inconceivable potencies. So the whole universe is manifestation of His potencies. //Śakti parinambha//[?]. //Ekasthāne sthitasyagner jyotsnā. Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktir tathedam akhilaṁ jagat.// This is said in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa.// Just like the fire. We have got this lamp, it is situated in one place, but the light and heat are expanding. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is situated in His own abode, which is known as Goloka Vṛndāvana. //Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. This is the statement of //Brahma-saṁhitā.// He is situated in His own place, own abode, known as Goloka Vṛndāvana, but He is expanding Himself, //akhilātma-bhūtaḥ.// Everywhere He is present. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi// [Bs. 5.35]. He has expanded Himself by His energies. Just like heat and light, the energy of fire expands. It is very easy to understand. Similarly the energies, multi-energies... Not only one, but multi-energies. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. So His energies are acting so nicely that everything is coming in front as if automatically done. But it is not automatically done. This is foolishness. To understand that nature is working automatically is foolishness. The nature is working under the direction of Kṛṣṇa. That is real understanding. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. At the present moment, the so-called scientists, philosophers, they are simply studying the working of the material nature. But they do not know behind this material nature the real powerful is there. Just like we are enjoying the electric light, electric power, but as soon as it has failed from the powerhouse, everything stopped. Similarly, the real power is Kṛṣṇa. He's the powerful, //śaktimān.// When He desires, there is creation, this material manifestation, and when He winds up, everything is finished. This is the way. So how He is doing that? That is explained in this chapter. //Pañca-tattva:// He's acting by expansion of His different features.

So Nityānanda Prabhu is the immediate expansion of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared here at Māyāpur, this very place where you are now sitting, with all these five features: Nityānanda Prabhu, Śrī Advaita Prabhu and Gadādhara Prabhu, Śrīnivāsa Prabhu. So He Himself, Kṛṣṇa, and Nityānanda Prabhu is immediate expansion of His personal self; Advaita Prabhu is incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu, Mahāviṣṇu, three; and Gadādhara Prabhu is the expansion of spiritual energy; and Śrīnivāsa Prabhu is the expansion of His marginal potency, marginal energy, //jīva-tattva. Jīva-tattva, śakti-tattva, prakāśa-tattva,// and //avatāra-tattva,// and He Himself. This //pañca-tattva.// This //pañca-tattva// will be explained in this chapter. That is the proposal of the author. //Guru-tattva kahiyāchi ebe pāñcera vicāra// [[books:cc:adi:7:3|[Cc. Ādi 7.3]]]. Consideration of the five. So although the Absolute Truth is one, He expands in His various features. That has been divided in Caitanya Mahāprabhu's practical exposition of //tattva-vicāra,// in six: five personal, and the //guru// is also representative. //Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair. Guru// is also expansion of Hari for the benefit of the conditioned soul. For the benefit of the conditioned soul, He is within everyone's heart. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. So He's trying to teach us from within, and He sends His representative for preaching without.

So Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He's preaching about Himself, because without knowing, without understanding the //tattva, vetti māṁ tattvataḥ,// without understanding the Absolute Truth as He is, there is no question of getting out of the clutches of //māyā. Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. "One who surrenders unto Me," Kṛṣṇa says, "he can get out of the clutches of //māyā.//" //Māyā// means this material life. We have forgotten ourself, that we are intimately related with Kṛṣṇa, we have got a special function on His behalf. Just like part and parcel of my body: the finger has got a special function, the leg has got a special function, the head has got a special function; similarly, we all part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we have got a special function in relationship with the Lord. When we are forgetful of this special relationship with Kṛṣṇa, that is called conditional life, or material life. Material life means we do not serve Kṛṣṇa but we serve our senses---//kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mātsarya,// like that. That is material life. We are serving, there is no doubt about it, but every one of us, we are serving our senses. //Kāmādīnāṁ katidhā na katidhā pālitā durnideśa// [Brs. 3.2.25].

Therefore, in order to stop this stupidity of serving our senses, which will never come to an end, simply increase our bondage, we have to come to the spiritual master. //Ādau gurvāśrayam.// He'll teach how to convert or to divert the activities of the senses to please Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇendriya-prīti-icchā dhare nāma prema// [[books:cc:adi:4:165|[Cc. Ādi 4.165]]]. //Dhare prema nāma.// The senses will act. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they try to stop the activities of the senses. //Yogīs// also. //Yoga indriya saṁyamaḥ.// The //yogīs// artificially try to stop the sense activities. They are simply... Because common men, they know activities means sense activities, sense satisfaction... So //yogīs,// they artificially try to stop the sense activities. That is called //praṇāyāma---dhyāna, dhāraṇā, āsana, praṇāyāma,// like that. But that artificial stoppage of sense activities will not be ultimately beneficial. Or thinking that my sense activities may be stopped, I become silent, become one with the Supreme---that will also not help us.

The real philosophy is, the sense activities must be there, but purified. That is real life. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. Purified. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.// We cannot stop sense activities. That is not possible. Artificially if we stop, even as a big successful //yogī// or //jñānī,// it will not act. There are many instances. Just like Viśvāmitra Muni: he was a great //yogī.// So artificially he was trying to stop the sense activities. But it also failed, the attempt. Later on he met one beautiful woman and he failed in controlling the senses. That is the history. He was the biggest //yogī,// Viśvāmitra Muni. Similarly, there are many so-called //jñānīs// also, trying to become one with the Supreme. That is also not possible. //Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. //Vimukta-māninas,// they are thinking that they have become liberated, but that is not the fact. Why it is not fact? //Tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.// Because they did not take to the devotional service. //Tvayy asta-bhāvād.// They have no information of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore despite their severe austerities and penances and rising to the platform of Brahman realization---//āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]---they fall down.

Therefore, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu is practically teaching us with His five associates: Advaita, Nityānanda, Gadādhara and //śrīvāsādi gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.// Therefore if we want to approach the Absolute Truth, it is our duty to offer our respect to these five features of the Lord.

> śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda
> śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda

Therefore, in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we first of all worship the Pañca-tattva: //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara//---then we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Then it will be successful. Without going through the Pañca-tattva, with the mercy, nobody can understand Kṛṣṇa. It will remain a myth. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

You cannot understand Kṛṣṇa without the mercy of these Pañca-tattva. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, although He came personally, He taught the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā// and asked people, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. But because we are //mūḍhas,// we misunderstood Kṛṣṇa. We could not take the last instruction of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa again came as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to teach us how to approach Kṛṣṇa. If we read the life of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, His acceptance of //sannyāsa// order, His preaching all over India, His chanting and dancing, His living at Jagannath Purī, His activities, His meeting with the devotees, His Guṇḍicā-mārjana, His Ratha-yātrā //kīrtana//---if we study all these activities of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, immediately you understand Kṛṣṇa.

Therefore, we are inviting you at this place of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, His birth site, to take the inspiration given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. That will help us understanding Kṛṣṇa. //Tato māṁ tattvato jñātvā visate tad anantaram// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa, //tattvataḥ,// in truth, by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu... //Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's activities means His distributing //kṛṣṇa-prema,// love of Kṛṣṇa. He has no other business. He has no other business. At the full youthful age He gave up His family life, beautiful wife, most obedient, perfect wife, beautiful wife, mother, affectionate mother, very good prestige, social prestige. Nimāi Paṇḍita, learned scholar, everything He sacrificed. //Tyaktvā su-dustyaja rājya lakṣmīm// [SB 11.5.34]. Gave up everything---that is the teachings of Lord Caitanya---and became a servant of Kṛṣṇa personally. He's Kṛṣṇa Himself, but teaching us how to become servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is the significance of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or Kṛṣṇa Himself along with His personal associates---//sāṅgopāṅgāstra pārṣadam...// [SB 11.5.32] Kṛṣṇa comes to kill the demons: //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. This is the business of Kṛṣṇa, two-sided business: one side killing the demons, another side giving the protection to the devotees. So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared on this part 488 years ago to, I mean to say, hand the same two principles, //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.// He... //Vināśāya duṣkṛtām.// He killed Jagāi-Mādhāi not by the body, but by their atrocious activities, stopped that. So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is to kill the demon---not by life but by their heinous activities. Anyone who comes to be killed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, his heinous, nefarious activities becomes killed and he becomes a Vaiṣṇava, just like Jagāi-Mādhāi.

So at the present moment, the whole world is full of Jagāi-Mādhāi, their four principles. Jagāi-Mādhāi means illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. This is Jagāi-Mādhāi. So this movement, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is killing these Jagāi-Mādhāi principles: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling and no meat-eating. So one side, killing the Jagāi-Mādhāi principle, and other side protection, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.//

Thank you very much. [end]
