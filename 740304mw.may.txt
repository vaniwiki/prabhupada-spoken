**Prabhupāda:**
...every paisa you should spend for Kṛṣṇa. Not that "Kṛṣṇa is giving money. Let us squander it as much as we like." Then there will be scarcity. [break] What is that?

**Jayapatākā:**
This is a short cut.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, all right. [break] //...pūjyante dhanya yatra susancitam// [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita], "Where a rascal is not worshiped, where foodstuff is kept very carefully," and //dampatyoḥ kalaha nāsti,// "and when there is no fight between husband and wife, or family-wise," //tatra śrīḥ svayam āgataḥ,// "there goddess of fortune is always present." Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is the principle given by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, the greatest politician and moralist. //Mūrkha// means who is not pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He's a //mūrkha// or //mūḍha.// Not that A-B-C-D learned. A-B-C-D learned is no use. And another //śloka,// Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says who is learned man. //Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu:// "One who does not think of any illicit sex life." //Mātṛvat...// Every woman---mother. Except his married wife, every woman is mother. //Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat// [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita]: "And others' money, just like garbage." Nobody touches.

//Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat,// and //ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu:// "And one who sees like himself all other living entities, he's //paṇḍita,// he's learned." Not by M.A., Ph.D. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] //...yaḥ paśyati. Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. [break] //...nihāram iva bhā...// It is called //nihāra.// As long..., as soon as the sun becomes strong, immediately, everything finished. Just see. This... What is called fog, or...?

**Jayapatākā:**
Just like when you came to the West, Prabhupāda, you cleared away the fog.

**Prabhupāda:**
At least I tried for that. Whatever is done, it is done by Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...keeps intelligent to the sincere servant. Otherwise, everything is done by Kṛṣṇa. So if you..., one is sincere to Kṛṣṇa, he will act everything rightly because the direction is... //Buddhi yogaṁ dadāmi tam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. The perfect direction is there. I do not know why people denies to take direction from Kṛṣṇa. He gets perfect direction, but he does not like to take. What is this tree?

**Jayapatākā:**
The //imli,// I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Lol imli?//

**Jayapatākā:**
Not //imli?// They call that...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, not //imli. Imli's// different. This way, up to that river? [break] //Bās. Vāsudeva-parāyaṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]. //Vāsudeva-parāyaṇa,// means Kṛṣṇa conscious person, they solve all questions by one thing: Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Exactly like the sun solves all the problem of this //nihāra,// foss. It is called foss?

**Jayapatākā:**
Fog.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fog.

**Jayapatākā:**
Mist.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nihāram iva bhāskara// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]. Let the scientists do it in their scientific way, drive away the fog. Is there any process? Eh? [laughs] In the ocean, when there is fog like this, they have to stop all the ships and cry, [makes sound like fog horn:] //onnnh, onnnh,// so that they may not collide. I have seen it when I was coming, going to USA. Where is Mohanānanda? He is here? No. Mohanānanda? Hare Kṛṣṇa. The difference between other camps and our: they call these men from their daily, I mean to say, life, householder's life, for this purpose for a week or so, but they are not dedicated. Here, in our camp, all our people are dedicated to the cause. That is the difference. So they cannot surpass your activities.

**Jayapatākā:**
Because you are dedicated, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, everyone should be dedicated, I or you. Does not... That is the success of life. Dedicate your life for Kṛṣṇa. That is the perfection. Even there are some faults, even dedicated life is noble life. Maybe, due to our past habits, we may commit some faulty action, but that dedicated life is sublime. //Api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]].

**Jayapatākā:**
This, from this... This is the land that we want to get. It starts from here. And that's our land there. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...immediately appreciates Kṛṣṇa's intelligence. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svā-bhāvikī...// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. It is being done as if automatically. But no, there is brain. That brain, these rascals, they cannot find out. Machine, nature only. What is this nature? Nonsense. So which way we shall go? This way? Up to the river?

**Jayapatākā:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Each and every grain...

**Jayapatākā:**
Here's our mango tree.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Mango.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mango tree?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Yes.

**Bhavānanda:**
Planted, uh... [end]
