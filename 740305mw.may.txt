**Prabhupāda:**
...no woman can... [break] So I took it very a cheap price.

There was no question of woman. I kept my office there. And the address was Multani temple. This is a famous temple, from [indistinct], Grant Road. And in my retired life my office was there, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple, and Delhi, Chippiwada. And my residence was Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. And before that, that Keśī Ghāṭa. Who has seen that? You have...?

**Devotee:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That was also temple. Yes.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Kṛṣṇa has arranged.

**Indian devotee (2):**
Very nice side, Prabhupāda, there.

**Prabhupāda:**
I lived in that house for seven years. And then I came to Rādhā-Dāmodara temple.

**Devotee:**
Very nice there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Which way? [break] ...stayed in that Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple, Malliks. And still I am living in temple. So Kṛṣṇa has arranged nicely, from the beginning of my life, temple. Which way? This way? [break] //Medha.// This is called //medha,// this rod, central. So the, the bull is bound up with it, and he goes round, goes round, all day. So //gṛhamedhī// means center is home, and he goes round, throughout the whole life. They are called //gṛhamedhīs.//

**Hṛdayānanda:**
This is called //medha.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Medha,// yes. Another //medha// means killing. So one who keeps himself in household life, he kills himself. Killing. //Gṛhamedhī.// And that is little long-term meaning. But this is the direct meaning. The //medha// rod is there, and he simply... He's very busy. Busy means within few feet. But he's thinking he's very busy. Anyone got..., he has got home, and he's simply rounding about. Anywhere you go, the center is that. And what is that //gṛha?// [aside:] Where? Which way?

**Bhavānanda:**
This way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Na gṛhaṁ gṛham ity āhur gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate// [[books:cc:adi:15:27|[Cc. Ādi 15.27]]]. The //gṛham,// house, is not actually //gṛha. Gṛha// means the wife. //Gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate na gṛhaṁ gṛham ity āhuḥ. Gṛhiṇī gṛham ucyate.// So to become householder means one must have a wife. So actually round the wife. //Gṛhamedhī:// round the wife. And what is wife means, everyone knows. It means round that thing. Is that good analysis?

**Devotees:**
//Jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Na gṛhaṁ gṛham ucyate.// [break] ...explain. It is not my manufacture. What is said? //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi. Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi. Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi...// [break] //...tuccham.// The //gṛhamedhī's// happiness, what is that happiness? //Maithunādi:// sex. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham. Gṛhamedhi-sukham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Those who are //gṛhamedhīs,// what is their happiness? Sex, that's all. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham.// And what is that sex? //Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham.// It is itching between the two hands. //Kaṇḍūyanena kara.// But the..., after that itching, there is very bad effect. //Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham//---that is unhappiness. Therefore //tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Those who are //kṛpaṇā,// they are not satisfied. They want to do it... [break] [end]
