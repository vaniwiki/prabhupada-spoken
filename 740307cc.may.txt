Translation: "Spiritually there are no differences between these five tattvas, for on the transcendental platform everything is absolute. Yet there are also varieties in the spiritual world, and in order to taste these spiritual varieties one should distinguish between them."

**Prabhupāda:**

> pañca-tattva---eka-vastu, nāhi kichu bheda
> rasa āsvādite tabu vividha vibheda
> [[books:cc:adi:7:5|[Cc. Ādi 7.5]]]

//Pañca-tattva.// The Absolute Truth is divided into five subject matter of relishing transcendental mellow. //Advaya:// without any difference. //Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]: Absolute Truth is one, but still, there are varieties, transcendental varieties. Just like Brahman, impersonal Brahman; and Paramātmā, localized aspect of the Supreme Lord, Paramātmā; and Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead---they are one. There is no difference. Brahman is not different from Bhagavān, and Bhagavān is not different from Brahman. Bhagavān is addressed by Arjuna as Para-brahman. Brahman realization, gradually... First realization: impersonal Brahman; then localized Brahman; then personal Brahman. The personal Brahman is called Para-brahman, the Supreme Brahman. Impersonal Brahman is the beginning of realization of the Absolute Truth. That is not final. Therefore those who are satisfied with impersonal Brahman, their knowledge is not perfect. //Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. The realization of the Absolute Truth is the platform of //viśuddha-sattva.// So unless one comes to the platform of personal realization of the Lord, one is supposed to be //aviśuddha-buddhi:// intelligence is not yet perfectly pure.

So here it is said, //eka-vastu.// So far the substance is concerned, that is //eka-vastu.// Just like in logical categories the substance is there, and there are many categories. Take for example that the Absolute Truth is one, but there are categories: "This is //śakti-tattva;// this is //prakāśa-tattva;// this is incarnation //tattva;// this is marginal potency; this is external potency." //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. There are many multipotencies. Because the original is Absolute Truth, in one sense everyone is in the same absolute platform. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there is a verse, //idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:20|[SB 1.5.20]]]. //Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ:// "This //viśva,// the whole cosmic manifestation, is Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead," just like Kṛṣṇa manifested His universal form. So every part and parcel is Bhagavān, but still, it is different.

This is the philosophy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //acintya-bhedābheda:// simultaneously one and different, inconceivable. We cannot conceive at the present moment how one thing can be the same, at the same time different; therefore it is called //acintya,// inconceivable. But //bhedābheda...// Just like we are---everything---you study. It is //acintya-bhedābheda,// one and different. Take for example your own body and you, soul. The soul is different from the body. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. The //dehi,// the soul, is within the body, but the body is not the soul. So this is different. Soul is different from the body. We have studied. But in another sense, soul is not different from the body, another sense. How? Because the body, the material body, is also coming from the same source, and the spiritual soul is coming from the same source, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //apareyam.// Kṛṣṇa said, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. "These material elements, they are My //bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā,// eight kinds of separated energy." Even though it is separated energy, it is the energy of the Supreme Lord. We have discussed many times: Just like the fire and the heat and light. Light is separated from the fire, heat is separated from the fire, but at the same time, heat and light is not different from the fire. This is to be understood. This is called simultaneously one and different, inconceivable.

So Māyāvādī philosophers, they take one side only, that it is one. They do not understand what is the difference, what is the different taste, varieties. They cannot understand the varieties, unity in diversity. They cannot understand. Just like sugar and milk---you prepare so many sweetmeats: "This is //rasagullā,// this is //sandeṣa,// this is //burfī,// this is this, this is that." Hundreds of preparation you can... But what is that? That sugar and milk. So similarly, variety is the mother of enjoyment. The Māyāvādī philosopher, they cannot understand. Therefore they have been described in the //Bhāgavata// that //vimukta-māninaḥ, aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. They are thinking that now they have become one with the Supreme, Nārāyaṇa. They address between themselves, "//Namo nārāyaṇa,//" that "Everyone has become Nārāyaṇa." This is their... "Everyone is Nārāyaṇa," that's all right, but still, different.

That distinction is made by the Vaiṣṇavas. The same example: The different energies, material energy and spiritual energy, they are different. One is superior, one is inferior. But when you go to the central point from where all energies are coming... //Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante.// This is the Vedic injunction, "From where everything is emanating."

> agnir mahī gaganam ambu marud diśaś ca
> kālas tathātma-manasīti jagat-trayāṇi
> yasmād bhavanti vibhavanti viśanti yaṁ ca
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.51]

//Agni// is coming from Kṛṣṇa. //Mahī,// the earth, it is coming from Kṛṣṇa. //Agni, mahī, gagana,// the sky, it is coming from Kṛṣṇa. //Ambu,// water, is coming from Kṛṣṇa. //Agni mahī gaganam ambu... Marut,// air, is coming from Kṛṣṇa. Because it is coming from Kṛṣṇa, it is not different from Kṛṣṇa. Everything is Kṛṣṇa. But when you taste the air breezing and the water and the earth and the fire, you cannot say, "Because the air is coming from Kṛṣṇa and water is coming from Kṛṣṇa, so either I may be in the air or in the sea, it is all the same." We are living in air, but if I think that air and the water is the same, I jump over the ocean, that is not very good idea. But actually, air is also Kṛṣṇa, water is also Kṛṣṇa, earth is also Kṛṣṇa, fire is also Kṛṣṇa, because it is..., they are all Kṛṣṇa's energy.

So in this way, if we try to understand that Pañca-tattva,

> śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda, 
> śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda

This is Pañca-tattva: Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Śrī Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Śrī Gadādhara and Śrīvāsādi. //Śrīvāsādi// means //jīva-tattva.// The //jīva-tattva, śakti-tattva, viṣṇu-tattva,// these are all //tattvas.// So Pañca-tattva. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is the supreme //tattva,// Kṛṣṇa. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya.// We are worshiping Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. So Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa combined. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya.//

> rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktir asmād
> ekātmānāv api bhuvi purā deha-bhedaṁ gatau
> caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptam...
> [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]

Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. When Kṛṣṇa wants to enjoy... The enjoyer... //Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. He's enjoyer. So when He wants to enjoy, that is not material enjoyment. That is spiritual enjoyment, superior energy, not material energy. Because Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, therefore He enjoys the superior energy. So Kṛṣṇa's... The Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //līlā// is not material. One who understands Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //līlā// as material, they are misled. Kṛṣṇa cannot enjoy anything material. He's supreme pleasure... If you say that "We are seeing daily that you are offering //prasādam,// the vegetable, rice. They are all material," no, they are not material. This is real understanding. How it is not material? That is //acintya,// inconceivable. Kṛṣṇa can turn material into spiritual and spiritual into material. That is Kṛṣṇa's inconceivable power, //acintya-śakti.// Unless you accept //acintya-śakti// of Kṛṣṇa, you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. //Acintya-śakti.//

So this is simultaneously one and different. This //acintya-bhedābheda-tattva// you'll find everywhere in Vaiṣṇava philosophy. Similarly, here the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is trying to explain that //pañca-tattva eka-vastu,// they are one Kṛṣṇa, but //āsvāda, āsvāda,// taste... //Akhila-rasāmṛta-sindhu.// Kṛṣṇa is the ocean of all pleasure, reservoir of all pleasure. There are different types of pleasure. Just like pleasure, like master and the servant. The master is also pleased by the service of the servant, and the servant is pleased by rendering service to the master. This is taste. Husband and wife: husband is pleased having a wife, wife is pleased having... These are the different tastes: between master and servant, between friend and friend, between father and son, mother and son, between the lover and the beloved. These are different taste. So this taste is required, transcendental mellow. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they cannot understand this taste. They think everything is one. And in the material world also, we accept, "Variety is the mother of enjoyment." Without varieties, although everything is spiritual... In Vṛndāvana everything is spiritual. Just like //gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, yebā jāne cintāmaṇi.// Just like this place, Gaura-maṇḍala-bhūmi, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's place of pastimes, and the Vṛndāvana-dhāma, the place of pastimes of Lord Kṛṣṇa, they are one and the same. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that //gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, yebā jāne cintāmaṇi, tā 'ra haya vraja-bhūmi vāsa.// These are the theses given by great //ācāryas.//

So we should not consider that Nityānanda is different from Kṛṣṇa..., Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, or Advaita Prabhu is different from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. But at the same time, They are different. This is inconceivable, a taste. If you worship Nityānanda Prabhu, it is as good as to worship Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The best thing is... Because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in His five different features, therefore the //ācāryas,// they worship all of them at a time. That is our prayer:

> śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda
> śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda

This is the varieties, transcendental varieties, different taste. Nityānanda Prabhu is //guru-tattva,// and Caitanya Mahāprabhu is //sevya-tattva.// The //guru// is teaching; Nityānanda Prabhu is teaching how to worship Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> bhaja gaurāṅga kaha gaurāṅga laha gaurāṅgera nāme
> ye jana gaurāṅga bhaje sei amāra prāṇa re

This is Nityānanda Prabhu's business. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that //gaurāṅgera balite habe, pulaka śarīre, hari hari balite, nayane ba'be nīra.// Gaurāṅga.

So to become immediately in ecstasy of transcendental love, if we chant this //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda,// it is easier. There is no offense in chanting this //pañca-tattva,// but there is offense if you do not properly chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// There are ten kinds of offenses, you know. But in chanting //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda,// there is no //aparādha.// You chant in any way, you'll get the result. This is the difference, taste. This is variety. Although there is no difference by chanting //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda// and Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra, mahā-mantra,// but still, by chanting this //pañca-tattva,// you'll get immediately, quickly, result. Therefore our process is to chant the holy names of the Pañca-tattva and then we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// That is perfect. And neither mixing. The mixing taste is called //rasābhāsa. Rasābhāsa.// And we don't manufacture anything. Just follow. We disagree with the persons who chant that //bhaja nitāi-gaura rādhe-śyāma.// No. No. We must follow strictly. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. We cannot manufacture simply for some worldly cheap reputation and prestige. If we manufacture something, that will not help us. We must follow. //Mahājano yena. Dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyāṁ, mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. We must follow the //mahājanas.// So you'll find in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// the Kavirāja Gosvāmī, in every chapter he begins, //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda, jaya advaita..., gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.// This is the process.

So we may read herewith one commentary by my Guru Mahārāja Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. [reading:] "In his //Anubhāṣya// commentary, Śrī Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura describes the Pañca-tattva as follows: The supreme energetic, the Personality of Godhead, manifesting in five kinds of pastimes, appears as the Pañca-tattva. Actually, there is no difference between them because they are situated on the absolute platform, but they manifest different spiritual varieties as a challenge to impersonalists to taste different kinds of spiritual humors, //rāsas...//" Because they do not accept the different taste. The Māyāvāda philosophy and Vaiṣṇava philosophy, the only difference is... Although the aim is one, Absolute Truth, but the difference is that they do not accept varieties, varieties of taste. Therefore they fall down. It is not our version, but it is stated in the Vedic literature, //āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]: "By severe penance and austerities, these Māyāvādīs, they go up to the Brahman effulgence, but from there they fall down." Fall down, because for want of varieties. You cannot live without varieties. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt:// "The Absolute Truth is //ānandamayo// by nature," //abhyāsāt.//

So there are the interpretation of the Māyāvādīs of this //Vedānta-sūtra, ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. But we see that the Supreme Absolute Person is //ānandamāyā.// Kṛṣṇa, you'll never see without //ānanda.// He is, I mean to say, taking care of the cows, He's dancing with the //gopīs,// He's playing with His cowherd boys. //Ānandamāyā.// These are //ānandamāyā.// These are the varieties. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they cannot understand; therefore they think that "This //kṛṣṇa-līlā// is //māyā.//" Therefore we call them Māyāvādī. Everything... //Māyā māyā, neti neti.// They take Kṛṣṇa also as //māyā;// therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. Because a living entity comes in this material world accepting this material body, similarly, when Kṛṣṇa comes, they think that He has also a material body. This is Māyāvāda. Kṛṣṇa has no such thing. Therefore you'll find in Dr. Radhakrishnan's book, when Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], he says, "Not to the Kṛṣṇa person, but the Absolute which is within the Kṛṣṇa." He does not know that Kṛṣṇa is not different from His body. That he does not know.

Kṛṣṇa is absolute. //Sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā// [[books:bg:4:6|[Bg. 4.6]]].

> yadā yadā hi dharmasya
> glānir bhavati bhārata
> abhyutthānam adharmasya
> tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham
> [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]

//Sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā// [[books:bg:4:6|[Bg. 4.6]]]. He does not accept this māyic body. //Etad īśanam īśasya// [[books:sb:1:11:38|[SB 1.11.38]]]. That is the, I mean to say, power, omnipotency of Kṛṣṇa. Even He accepts this material body, it does not mean that He is material. Just like we see the Deity, the Deity, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity, in our front. Everyone will say, "Oh, this is a Deity made of brass, material." But no, it is not material. You have to study in that way. //Arcye śilā-dhīr... Arcye viṣṇu śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matiḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. These are //nārakī buddhi. Vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.// The Deity as material, //śiladhiḥ,// considering as metal or stone or wood, and //guruṣu nara-matiḥ,// and //guru// as ordinary human being... //Vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ:// a Vaiṣṇava, to consider, "Here is American Vaiṣṇava and here is a //brāhmaṇa// Vaiṣṇava..." No, Vaiṣṇava is Vaiṣṇava. This is absolute. //Guruṣu nara-matiḥ. Guru,// although he is appearing like human being, he should not be considered. //Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit// [SB 11.17.27]. These are the injunction of the //śāstras.//

Suppose we are worshiping here. The Māyāvādī will say, "They are worshiping a brass, metal Deity." So are we so fools that we are spending so much money for worshiping a lump of metal? That they do not know. This is //acintya-bhedābheda.// And fact is there. Kṛṣṇa is omnipotent. He can accept your service in any way, as He likes. This is called //arcā-vigraha.// As Kṛṣṇa's //avatāra// is there, here is also another //avatāra, arcā-vigraha.// He is so kind. You cannot see Kṛṣṇa, you cannot touch Kṛṣṇa at the present moment, but Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He appears before you as you can touch, you can dress, you can offer your respect, you can see. That is Kṛṣṇa's mercies. But don't think that Kṛṣṇa has become metal. No. And even if He becomes metal, there is no difference. And what is this metal? That is Kṛṣṇa's energy. We have to understand in that way.

So this //acintya-bhedābheda-tattva... Pañca-tattva-eka-vastu, nāhi kichu bheda rasa āsvādite. Rasa āsvādite,// the mellows, transcendental mellows. So these chapters of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// are very... These are postgraduate study. You have to read it very carefully and as they are described. We have tried to describe them as far as possible for being understood by us, but we should be very careful,
