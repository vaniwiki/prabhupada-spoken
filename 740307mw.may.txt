**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone will understand. Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is proved. We are going to Africa. We are going to Canada, Europe, America. Everyone chants Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is the language. When a young man and young woman loves one another, there is no question of language.

My Guru Mahārāja used to say that "Suppose you are in a foreign country. You do not know the language. But when there is fire, you get friends without any language." You see? In the beginning of British rule there were not very many English-knowing Indian. So a clerk in his office was working. So monkey came and he scattered the office papers. So after the monkey was driven away, he was collecting the papers. In the meantime, his English boss came: "What is this, man?" So he could not say. He began to jump. You see? "Monkey, sir. Monkey, sir. [laughter] Monkey, sir." "All right. All right. That's all right." Simply to inform, without any language, you can jump, "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa," and he will understand. [//japa//] [Bengali] //Thik hai?//

**Indian man:**
[Bengali] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance. Do this. [break] ...and for constructing four buildings like that. [break] Kṛṣṇa took part in politics. So what is His politics? What is His sociology? What is His culture?

**Indian man:**
Support the right minority?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Indian man:**
Support the right minority?

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no question of minority. Support the right person. Kṛṣṇa supported Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira in place of Duryodhana. So formerly it was monarchy. That is perfect politics. This democracy is useless. It was proved. One man, the king, he should be properly educated how to rule, what is the aim of ruling, how the people will be, I mean to say, culturally elevated, what is that culture. [break] There was a consulting board of learned //brāhmaṇas// and saintly persons. They would advise the monarch how to rule.

**Jayapatākā:**
This is... This is the land here.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the land?

**Jayapatākā:**
Yeah, we're walking over it. We're going through... [break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
Elizabeth, in England, she's got a..., what she calls a "think tank," or a board of advisors, who meet and advise her on different policies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Privy council.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Something like that. It's called a "think tank," she's named it. It's presided over by Lord..., Lord Goodman.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. The thing is, unless the people are Kṛṣṇa conscious, either this board or that board, that will not help. First of all, people should know what is the aim of life, what is culture, how the human activity should be directed. The people should know first of all this. Otherwise, changing from frying pan to the fire, it is useless. That is going on. That change, revolution, is going on. Just like the Russian people, they changed the Czarist government into Communist government, revolution, but still they're unhappy. They're trying to change by another revolution. This is going on. //Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]. This is described in the //śāstra// as "chewing the chewed." Or the same simple philosophy: "This side of stool is better than that side." So he keeps the whole thing, stool. "This side, the dry side, is better, and the moist side, wet side, is bad." This is no philosophy. It..., it must not be stool. It must be gold. Then it is all right, this side or that side. That philosophy, that the dry side of stool is better than the wet side, this will not help. So first, first of all, human society must know what is the aim of life. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇu// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. We are part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu. We are suffering on account of our relationship with God. This is the cause of our suffering. Then we have to make plan how to revive our lost relationship with God. Then the... Everything is there in the Vedic literature. All directions are there. So we have to... Just like when we are in danger, we consult some learned man or physician or a lawyer, similarly we have to consult the Vedic culture, how perfect it is. This way?

**Jayapatākā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then everything is there. You haven't got to manufacture anything. And the //Bhagavad-gītā// is the gist idea of all Vedic culture. And our propaganda is to establish that gist idea of //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So therefore I am asking, "What is the politics of Kṛṣṇa?" Kṛṣṇa's politics was to have a king of the world which..., Kṛṣṇa conscious, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That is the Kṛṣṇa's politics. He wanted to replace. So the first politic is to replace these so-called leaders, demons. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Where is that land? This land?

**Jayapatākā:**
We already walked over it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Jayapatākā:**
You're talking, so I don't want to interrupt.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Jayapatākā:**
But on the way ba... It's that land over there.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where are... Where are those boys? That Svarūpānanda?

**Jayapatākā:**
They may have gone back to the temple now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Jayapatākā:**
Is ours. This land... I'm sending... Because land... We are... Different land takes different time, so I'm sending both information out for this land here---it goes from this path, this, over to the other side of the barley, right to the river edge, twenty //bighās//---or this one, ten //bighās.// Whichever is first. This is more fertile. For agriculture, this one...

**Prabhupāda:**
So which one like, you like?

**Indian man:**
Whichever one is possible. As he says, "First come, first served."

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. So arrange. During his stay, arrange something.

**Indian man:**
Something available here also?

**Śyāmasundara:**
This is the old river bed, isn't it, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayapatākā:**
Yes. Other side of the river. This plot goes right... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...will help us.

**Indian man:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Jayapatākā:**
A big road.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you purchase on this side land?

**Jayapatākā:**
This land is for sale with this dhow here. [end]
