Translation: "Kṛṣṇa, the reservoir of all pleasure, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, the supreme controller. No one is greater than or equal to Śrī Kṛṣṇa..."

[loud talking in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Stop this.

**Pradyumna:** "...yet He appears as the son of Mahārāja Nanda."

**Prabhupāda:**
[noise continues] [aside:] Stop.

//Svayam bhagavān kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. Whatever Kavirāja Gosvāmī is speaking---not out of his own whimsical way---whatever he's speaking, he's following the //paramparā// system. That is Vaiṣṇavism, or //ācārya. Ācāryavan puruṣo veda// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.14.2].

[people continue talking] [aside:] Stop this.

Unless we accept the //ācārya// in the //paramparā// system, we cannot understand things as they are. It is not possible. So Kavirāja Gosvāmī, he's describing this //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// strictly according to the verdict of the //śāstras.// His statement is that Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead. //Svayam bhagavān kṛṣṇa.// Bhagavān is person; Bhagavān is not imperson. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. First realization of the Absolute Truth by speculative knowledge is impersonal effulgence of the Lord, which is called //brahma-jyotir.// Then next realization is Paramātmā, the localized aspect of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But realization of Kṛṣṇa, that is the ultimate realization. //Svayam bhagavān kṛṣṇa.//

Bhagavān means six opulences. Nobody is richer than Bhagavān, nobody is stronger than Bhagavān, nobody is more beautiful than Bhagavān, nobody is wiser than Bhagavān, and nobody is more renouncer than Bhagavān. That is Bhagavān. //Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. That is Bhagavān. //Svayam bhagavān// means He is opulent //ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇa,// not partially. He knows everything. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, vedāhaṁ samatītāni// [[books:bg:7:26|[Bg. 7.26]]]. He knows past, present and future. He says, therefore, that "All these, My dear Arjuna---yourself, Myself and all the soldiers and kings who have assembled here---it is not that we were not existing before. We are existing at the present moment also, and in future also we shall continue to exist." And how we shall exist? Individually. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa would have said that in future, when we become liberated, then we shall become one. No. He says, "Even in future also, we shall continue to exist like this. You are individual. You are Arjuna. I am Kṛṣṇa. And all other living entities..." That is real understanding. Every one of us living entities, we are all individual person, and Kṛṣṇa is also individual person. This is knowledge. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. Kṛṣṇa, or God, He's also //nitya,// eternal. We are also //nitya,// eternal. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. We do not die. That is the preliminary knowledge of spiritual understanding, that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// but I am individual." //Nityo nityānām.// Kṛṣṇa is individual person; I am also individual person. When Kṛṣṇa says that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], it does not mean that I become one with Kṛṣṇa or merge into the existence of Kṛṣṇa. I keep my individuality, Kṛṣṇa keeps His individuality, but I agree to abide by His order. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// to Arjuna that "I have spoken to you everything. Now what is your decision?" Individual. It is not that Kṛṣṇa is forcing Arjuna. //Yathecchasi tathā kuru// [[books:bg:18:63|[Bg. 18.63]]]: "Now whatever you like, can do." That is individuality.

So this is the ultimate knowledge, that this Māyāvāda philosophy, that to become one, merge into the existence... Merge into the existence means we merge into the order of Kṛṣṇa. Our individuality at the present moment is //māyā,// because we are planning so many things. Therefore your individuality and my individuality clashes. But when there will be no more clashing---we shall agree, "Central point is Kṛṣṇa"---that is oneness, not that we lose our individuality. So as it is stated in all Vedic literature and spoken by Kṛṣṇa, we are all individual. All individual. //Svayaṁ bhagavān ekale īśvara// [[books:cc:adi:5:142|[Cc. Ādi 5.142]]]. But the difference is that He is the supreme ruler, //īśvara. Īśvara. Īśvara// means ruler. Actually He is ruler, and we are also ruler, but we are subordinate ruler. Therefore He is //ekale īśvara,// one ruler. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇa// [Bs. 5.1], in the //Brahma-saṁhitā. Ekale īśvara. Īśvara// cannot be many. That is not //īśvara.// The Māyāvāda philosophy that everyone is God, that is not very right conclusion. That is rascaldom. Kṛṣṇa says, //mūḍha. Na māṁ prapadyante mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. One who does not submit to the supreme //īśvara,// the Supreme Lord, you should know it perfectly well that "Here is a //mūḍha,// rascal," because it is not that everyone, we can become //īśvara.// That is not possible. There is then no meaning of //īśvara. Īśvara// means the ruler. Suppose we are in a group, this, our International Society. If everyone becomes ruler or //ācārya,// then how it can be managed? No. There must be some head. That is the principle in our practical life. We follow our political leaders. We cannot say that "I belong to this party" unless I follow a leader. That is natural.

So that is the Vedic statement, //nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. There must be one leader, the leader of the same quality, //nitya.// I am //nitya;// Kṛṣṇa is //nitya.// Kṛṣṇa is also living entity; I am also living entity. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.// So what is the difference between Kṛṣṇa and me? The difference is that there are two //nityas,// or two //cetanaś.// One is described as singular number, and the other is described as plural number. //Nityo nityānām.// This //nityānām// is plural number, and //nitya// is singular number. So God is //nitya,// one, singular number, and we, we are being ruled; we are plural number. This is the difference. And how He is ruling the plural number? Because //eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. He's supplying all the necessities of life of all these plural number; therefore He's //īśvara,// He's Kṛṣṇa, He's God. One who is provides all the necessities of life, He's //īśvara,// He's Kṛṣṇa, He's God.

So we can very well understand that we are being maintained by Kṛṣṇa, and why we should not be ruled by Him? This is a fact. Now you can see in this country, in this village, Māyāpur, there so many food grains are growing, but who is supplying? That is Kṛṣṇa. It is not possible to grow these food grains in your factory. No. That is not possible. He's helping us. He has stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Unless you eat sufficiently, unless you have food grains in stock, you cannot flourish. //Bhūtāni. Bhavanti. Bhavanti// means flourishing. So both animals and men, they must eat sufficiently. There must be food grain sufficiently. So that food grain you cannot manufacture in your factory. You may start a very big factory, Goodyear Tire factory, but that tire also will not move when there is no supply of petrol. This is your position. You are dependent even for this tire and petrol, and what to speak of this food grain. So who is supplying the food grain? The supplying person is... //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. That singular number individual person, He is supplying. You can say //prakṛti,// nature, is supplying. No. Nature is not supplying. Nature is the agent of supply. Real supplier is Kṛṣṇa. //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.// And that is also stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā: mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. Nature is working under the instruction or the indication of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa.

In //Brahma-saṁhitā// also, it is stated, //sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā// [Bs. 5.44]. Here it is the //vibharti,// and //bibhavanti...// So nature is dependent, although nature has got this power, very extensive power, //sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya,// to create, to maintain and to annihilate. Such power nature has got, and therefore she is called Durgā, Durgādevī. In Bengal there is great, pompous Durgā-pūjā. That is nature worship. So... But nature is //yasya ajñāya;// she is working under the order of Kṛṣṇa. We Vaiṣṇava, it is not that we do not care for Durgā-devī. Somebody, they say like that. No. We offer her all respect, because she is the agent of Kṛṣṇa, but we do not accept foolishly that Durgā is all in all. No. That we do not accept. Durgā is the agent, working agent of Kṛṣṇa. //Yasyajñaya.//

> sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā
> chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni bibharti durgā
> icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā
> [Bs. 5.44]

//Sā ceṣṭate yasya icchānurūpam.// And Kṛṣṇa also confirms this: //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the supreme //īśvara,// controller. She is conducting the activities of the material nature. But those who are //mūḍhas,// they are captivated by the wonderful action of material nature. That is called materialist. //Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvaiḥ mohitaḥ// [[books:bg:7:13|[Bg. 7.13]]]. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// They are bewildered. Nature's business is to keep you fool always. And if you can surpass the bewilderment of material nature, if you agree to be controlled by the supreme controller, then your life is successful. Therefore //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// author says that "Here is the controller," //ekala,// "one." And Kṛṣṇa also says, //mām ekam.// Not that imitation Kṛṣṇa. Then you'll be befooled. //Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].

So all the verdict of the //śāstra// is the same. It is simply our misfortune that we do not understand the verdict of the //śāstra.// In the //śāstra,// everything is there. So Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. That is the verdict of the //śāstra.// In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is said. In //Bhāgavata// also said,

> ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ
> kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam
> indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ
> mṛḍayanti yuge yuge
> [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]

So try to understand. And Kṛṣṇa said, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "No more superior." You don't misunderstand that there is something superior to Kṛṣṇa. That is rascaldom. So long we shall remain such rascal we shall not surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //na māṁ prapadyante duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. //Prapadyante.// Who does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa? He'll say that "There are so many big, big person, and they do not surrender to Kṛṣṇa. So they are all //mūḍhas?//" Yes, they are all //mūḍhas.// That is the verdict of the //śāstra.// We cannot make any compromise. That is not possible, against the principle of the //śāstra.// If we keep one competitor of Kṛṣṇa, then we are //mūḍha.// Here it is said, //advitīya.// Not that there is another Kṛṣṇa, //dini// Kṛṣṇa, no. There is no... There cannot be any competitor of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat:// "There is no more anyone, bigger authority than Me." And here is also, //Caitanya-caritāmṛta kāj,// Kavirāja Gosvāmī, says, //advitīya:// no competitor, sir. Here we are all Gods, the rascaldom, that "Everyone is God." But there is competition of Gods. But in case of Kṛṣṇa there is no such possibility, no competition. Nobody can compete with Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa was present He showed it by practical example. Nobody could compete Him in either knowledge, either strength or love affairs or any field of activities. There was no competition.

Now, Kṛṣṇa, when He was present, He married sixteen thousand wives. Where is competition? One cannot marry even sixteen wives---and he becomes God. Just see the foolishness. Even from materialistic view, who is that God who can marry sixteen thousand wives? Is there any God, so-called rascal God? Is there any possibility? Kṛṣṇa showed, yes. Kṛṣṇa was attempted to be killed from the very childhood when He was three months old by Pūtanā. But He killed the Pūtanā //rakṣasī,// not He was killed. Similarly, Aghāsura, Bakāsura, this //asura,// that //asura,// simply from the beginning of His life, Kaṁsa and others, from the rogues, the //asuras,// they were making plan to kill Kṛṣṇa as soon as He is born. Kaṁsa, he was planning that "As soon as Kṛṣṇa is born..." He was trying to kill Kṛṣṇa's mother, Devakī, but with argument of Vasudeva that "Don't do this. Your sister's son will kill you, but your sister will not kill. So let the son be born. I shall bring it to you," Kaṁsa believed the honorable words of Vasudeva. Because he knew that "Vasudeva is very respectable, honorable man. He has promised that the children..., the child will be brought to me," so he saved his sister. He was such a cruel. The rogues and cruel, they do not care even for mother and sister. They can kill anyone, you see. That is the roguism. So Kaṁsa was that type of rogue. But Vasudeva, by his intelligence, saved the situation, but as honorable person, he brought all the children to Kaṁsa. You know this history.

So the Kaṁsa or the //asura's// plan is how to kill Kṛṣṇa, or God. That is going on. Everyone, "God is dead. God is dead." When I first went to your country the philosophy was that "God is dead." But they admitted, "No, God is living. Swāmījī has brought in //saṅkīrtana.//" That also they admit. Yes. So God cannot be dead. If we are not ever dead---//na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]---how God can be dead? That is another foolishness. God cannot be dead. //Nitya.// Then there is no meaning of //nitya.// So this is the position of Kṛṣṇa. He is the Supreme Person, supreme ruler, without any competitor. //Advitīya,// no competition. Here we have got competition, but with Kṛṣṇa there is no competition. There cannot be any competition. You cannot say that Lord Śiva or Lord Brahmā or any other demigods, they are also as good as Kṛṣṇa, equally. No. That is not possible. Then he would not have used this word //advitīya.// There cannot be any competition. If somebody puts any competitor before Kṛṣṇa, he's a //pāṣaṇḍī.//

> yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ
> brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ
> samatvenaiva vīkṣeta
> sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam
> [[books:cc:madhya:18:116|[Cc. Madhya 18.116]]]

"Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Person, if one compares with Nārāyaṇa with such exalted demigods like Lord Śiva, Lord Brahma...," //brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ,// "what to speak of other, Indra, Candra---they are nothing in comparison to Brahmā. Brahmā is the creator of this universe. So even such creator, even so powerful demigod as Lord Śiva, cannot be compared with Kṛṣṇa." //Advitīya.// Cannot be compared. That is //pāṣaṇḍī. Sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam.// So those who are comparing, "All the demigods and Kṛṣṇa, they are on the same level. You can worship anyone," they are all rascals. Because here it is said //advitīya:// Kṛṣṇa cannot be compared with anyone else. That is Kṛṣṇa. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. They may be //īśvara.// Lord Śiva may be //īśvara,// Lord Brahmā may be //īśvara,// but they cannot be //parama īśvara.// That is not possible. Parameśvara is Kṛṣṇa. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.//

So... But, at the same time, //nandātmaja,// or //vasudevātmaja.// That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. That is dealing between His devotee and Himself. Although nobody can become Kṛṣṇa's father, because He is the original father---//aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]---but He agrees to become the son of His devotee. This is called devotional dealing. //Śānta, dāsya sākhya, vātsalya-rasa.// This is the dealing of //vātsalya-rasa.// The father... Nobody can become father of Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. He is the father. //Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. He is the original father. Then how //nandātmaja?// How Nanda Mahārāja can become the father of Kṛṣṇa? No. That father means he wanted to become the best servant of Kṛṣṇa. When I become father of my child, I am the best servant of the child, actually. You see the children moving, and the mother is taking care. So the mother is the best servant of the child.

So this is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. They want to become one with the God, but we keep ourself always servant of God. And to become the best servant of God is also to become His father and mother. This is //nandātmaja.// Therefore one devotee prayed, //aham iha śrī-nandaṁ vande yasyālinde paraṁ brahma, śrutim apare smṛtim apare// [//Padyāvalī// 126]. The devotee is praying that "Somebody is studying the //Vedas,// somebody is studying the //Purāṇas,// the //smṛtis,//" //śrutim apare smṛtim apare,// "and somebody is studying //Mahābhārata// to understand God." But the devotee says, "I do not want to understand God. I want to worship Nanda Mahārāja, under whose..., in the courtyard of his house the Para-brahman is crawling." That is //nandātma...// That is the, I mean to say, superior position of //nandātmaja,// Nanda Mahārāja. So this is philosophy. Ordinary men cannot understand. But Vaiṣṇava philosophy is so nice that instead of becoming one with the Supreme, they want to become the father of the Supreme. This is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. //Nandātmāja. Rasika-śekhara.// This is also a pleasure. Kṛṣṇa wants to be subordinate to His devotee as son so that He may be punished. He is punishing everyone, but He wants to be punished also. That is His pleasure. And who will punish Him? His father and mother, superior. Or superior lover, Rādhārāṇī, can punish Him.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very scientific and sublime. Try to understand. Always read the books. Don't try to understand Kṛṣṇa ordinarily.

To understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy, but if you follow the //mahājana,// if you try to understand the philosophy through the //paramparā// system, then you'll realize Kṛṣṇa and your life will be successful.

Thank you very much.
