**Prabhupāda:**
So we are all very fortunate that different nations, from different parts of the world, are now combined together in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Some of you, you have come from Europe: England, France, Germany, Holland, Rome. Similarly, you have come from America: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco; Canada: Toronto, Ottawa, Vancouver; Africa: Nairobi, South Africa. So it is very good example that you have come from different parts of the world to join in the //saṅkīrtana// movement. That is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu predicted,

> pṛthivīte āche yata nagāradi grāma
> sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma
> [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]

He said that all over the world, as many towns and villages are there, the name of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu will be known. So His prediction was never to be foiled. So by His grace it is now becoming fulfilled. This is the real platform of United Nation. They are trying for United Nation, working for the last thirty years, but they have not been successful, neither they will ever be successful. That is our prediction. Yes. They'll never be successful. Because you cannot be united on the material platform. That is not possible. Because on the material platform... Material platform means on the bodily concept of life: "I am this body." "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am Christian," "I am Hindu," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //śūdra,//" all... So many "I am." All designation. So on the platform of designation there is not possibility of unity. That is not possible. Unity's possible on the spiritual platform. Those who are under the concept of this body, "I am this body," they have been described in the //śāstra// as //go-kharaḥ. Go// means cows, and //kharaḥ// means ass. //Sa eva go-kharaḥ.//

> yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke
> sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma-ijya-dhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

//Go// means cows, and //kharaḥ// means ass.

So this Vṛndāvana //tīrtha,// if somebody comes here with the bodily concept of life, he does not derive any benefit. //Yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile. Salila// means water. Just like generally people come here, take their bathing in the Yamunā River, and they think, "Now my business is finished. I came to Vṛndāvana. Now I have taken my bath in the Yamunā River and purchased some things from here. Now let me go home. I have finished my //tīrtha.//" But //śāstra// says, "No. That is not //tīrtha.//" //Janeṣv abhijñeṣu.// If you want to purify yourself, then in the //tīrtha// you must find out //abhijña. Abhijña// means one who knows. One who knows. What that knowing? One who knows Kṛṣṇa. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. //Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei guru haya// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]. One who must know who is Kṛṣṇa. This morning I met one gentleman. So in his house I saw that "//Prabhu.//" So I asked him, "Who is that //prabhu?//" So he says, "He has no name." Just see the fun. He's living in Vṛndāvana; he does not know the name of //prabhu.// Just see his position. //Prabhu// is Kṛṣṇa. //Prabhu// means //īśvara. Īśvara// means controller. A //prabhu// means proprietor. So Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ
> sarva-loka-maheśvaram
> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati
> [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]

> mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat
> kiñcid asti dhanañjaya
> [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]

//Aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. These words are there. And he's living in Vṛndāvana, he does not know who is his //prabhu.// This thing is going on. [aside:] You can go behind him. Yes. This man is... You are dozing. Hmm.

So, so long one will remain in the bodily concept of life, he cannot understand //prabhu,// or Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. So to understand this //prabhu// it requires many, many births. That is also said in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa says, //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. Because foolish person cannot understand //prabhu.// Another place Kṛṣṇa says,

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuriṁ-bhāvam āśritāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

So this... We..., our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to understand the //prabhu,// who is //prabhu,// who is the master, who is the Supreme Absolute. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement: to understand the supreme //prabhu,// or master, or the controller, and surrender unto Him. This is the process, simple process. That //prabhu// you can under..., cannot understand by mental speculation. That is not possible. //Nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyo na bahunā śrutena// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 1.2.23]. There are many Vedāntists, many scholar in Vedic literature, but they do not know who is his //prabhu.// They will say "//prabhu,//" but I ask him, "Who is your //prabhu?//" that they cannot say. Or they will not utter the name of the //prabhu.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that //māyāvādī haya kṛṣṇe aparādhī// [[books:cc:madhya:17:129|[Cc. Madhya 17.129]]] They will charge..., they will call "Brahmā," "Caitanya," "Paramātmā," "//Prabhu,//" but he will never utter the name of Kṛṣṇa. This is their disease. This is called Māyāvāda disease. Therefore, because people are so poor in knowledge, //alpa-medhasaḥ,// brain substance is very little, they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa Himself appeared as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

That was detected by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī:

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]

"My Lord, You are the most munificent incarnation, because people cannot understand even Kṛṣṇa, but You are distributing freely the love of Kṛṣṇa---the highest perfection of life, love of Kṛṣṇa." One may know Kṛṣṇa, but it is very difficult to know the love of Kṛṣṇa. //Gopī-bhāva-rasāmṛtābdhi-laharī-kallola-magnau sadā// [//Śrī Ṣaḍ-gosvāmy-aṣṭaka// 4]. Rūpa Gosvāmī... About the Gosvāmīs... They knew what is Kṛṣṇa, what is love of Kṛṣṇa. They wrote many books---//Vidagdha-mādhava, Lalita-mādhava, Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.// Actually... //Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.// So actually to understand Kṛṣṇa, one has to follow the footprints of the six Gosvāmīs:

> śrī-rūpa sanātana bhaṭṭa-raghunātha,
> śrī-jīva gopāla-bhaṭṭa dāsa-raghunātha

> ei chaya gosāñi yāra tāra mui dāsa
> tāṅ sabāra pada-reṇu mora pañca-grāsa

You have to accept the six Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana, who came here, who discovered Vṛndāvana. This Vṛndāvana is the discovery of the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, they were first deputed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Otherwise, it was a big field only. Caitanya Mahāprabhu discovered the Rādhā-kuṇḍa. In this way the Gosvāmīs were deputed, and Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī first of all established this Madana-mohana temple, then Govindajī. In this way all the city of Vṛndāvana... It is transcendental city, but it was begun by the inspiration, by the order, of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu because He appeared to distribute //kṛṣṇa-prema. Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. That is the highest perfection of life, //premā pum-artho mahān.//

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is //premā pum-artho mahān,// to achieve love of Godhead. That is the verdict of all //śāstras.//

> sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo
> yato bhaktir adhokṣaje
> ahaituky apratihatā
> yenātmā samprasīdati
> [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]

If you want really peace, then you develop your dormant love of God, Kṛṣṇa. Then you'll be happy. Otherwise you'll never be happy. Because we want to love somebody. That is natural. So we have placed our loving propensity in so many things, even to cats and dogs, but that will not satisfy us, because that is sense gratification. That is not real love. Real love is to love Kṛṣṇa, love of Kṛṣṇa. So this is the highest philosophy of life, highest perfection of life, how to learn to love Kṛṣṇa. The Vṛndāvana means simply loving Kṛṣṇa. The cowherds boy, the //gopīs,// the Nanda Mahārāja, Yaśodāmayī, Rādhārāṇī---the only focus is to love Kṛṣṇa. That's all. This is Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana does not mean a city or town or this or that. Vṛndāvana means where everyone is in love, in intense love with Kṛṣṇa. So you have come to Vṛndāvana. Try to learn how to love, intensified love, Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection of life. And that is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's contribution. //Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]].

So although we have got love propensity... Everyone loves somebody. But we are being frustrated, because that is not real love. Real love is to love Kṛṣṇa. You may execute your duties very nicely, but if you do not learn how to love Kṛṣṇa, this all discharging of your duties is simply working or laboring for nothing. //Śrama eva hi kevalam.//

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed ratiṁ yadi
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

//Śrama eva hi.// So why this love is not invoked or awakened in us? Because we are covered by this material energy, and we have become conditioned by the material energy. Therefore, to purify ourself we require certain process. That process is called //varṇāśrama. Varṇāśrama. Varṇa// means four divisions of the society: //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// And this //varṇāśrama// is created by Kṛṣṇa so that one day one may become devotee of Kṛṣṇa. The whole project is, Vedic project is, Vedic civilization... //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. Vedic civilization means that to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is Vedic civilization. //Vedānta-vid vedānta-kṛd cāham.// So the Vedāntist means to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Veda// means knowledge, and //anta// means the last. That Kṛṣṇa explains, //Vedānta// explains. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. This is //Vedānta.// One who understands Kṛṣṇa, he is Vedāntist. Not the //Pukkar//[?]. No. The so-called Vedāntists, they want to get out of Kṛṣṇa. They'll never accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme. That is not Vedāntist. Real Vedāntist is here: //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante. Jñānavān// means one who has actually knowledge. //Jñānavān.// So real knowledge is to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. This is knowledge.

So those who are followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Because He has come to distribute love of Godhead immediately.

> ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ
> śreyaḥ kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam
> ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtāsvādanaṁ
> sarvātma-snapanaṁ paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam
> [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]

And this is verdict of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: kalau doṣa-nidhe rājann asty eko mahān guṇaḥ// [SB 12.3.51]. This Kali-yuga is a ocean of fault, simply faulty. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. In this Kali-yuga people are..., duration of life is very short; and still, they are slow, //mandāḥ,// all bad; //sumanda-matayo,// and they have their different concoction of ideology and philosophy, //sumanda-matayo; manda-bhāgyā,// very unfortunate; and //upadrutāḥ,// always disturbed. This is the position of this age. Therefore this Kali-yuga is full of faulty atmosphere. //Kalau doṣa-nidhe rājann. Doṣa-nidhe:// ocean of faults. But there is one opportunity. What is that opportunity? The opportunity is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, who is teaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, //namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]], distributing //kṛṣṇa-prema.//

So in this Kali-yuga, although it is very faulty, people are very, very degraded, less than animal, still there is a great opportunity. And this opportunity is //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet// [SB 12.3.51]. Simply by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra. Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya.// You don't require to read //Vedānta// philosophy or this philosophy. Caitanya Mahāprabhu presented Himself: //guru more mūrkha dekhi kahile vedānta nāhi adhikārā// [[books:cc:adi:7:71|[Cc. Ādi 7.71]]]. He presented to Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī that His spiritual master saw Him a great fool. Therefore he said to Him that "You have no, I mean to say, access to understand //Vedānta// philosophy. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all." This is the position. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "He, he taught Me one //śloka.//" What is that? //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. [devotees join in, finish verse]. If you chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// then you become the first-class Vedāntist. You don't require to study. Of course, if you have got intelligence, if you have got stamina, //Vedānta// must be studied. And what is that //Vedānta? Vedānta// is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Bhāṣyaṁ brahma-sūtrāṇām. Brahma-sūtra// means //Vedānta.// This is the real //bhāṣya,// or commentary, on //Vedānta-sūtra.// The //Vedānta-sūtra// begins, //janmādy asya yataḥ, athāto brahma jijñāsā.// And //Bhāgavata// says, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.// The same thing, a little differently. And //janmādy asya śloka// is beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. In the //Vedānta-sūtra// the //sūtra// is //janmādy asya yataḥ:// "Absolute Truth is that from which or from whom everything emanates." //Janmādy asya yataḥ.// And //Bhāgavata// is explaining... That is commentary. What is that //janmādy asya yataḥ? Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ.// Who is that source of knowledge? He must be //abhijña.// Wherefrom He got this knowledge? //Svarāṭ.// These things are explained.

So you are all fortunate. You have come to Vṛndāvana, perhaps for the first time in life. So it is very good opportunity. //Vṛndāvana-dhāma. Aprākṛta, cintāmaṇi.// Similarly, you are coming from Navadvīpa. That is also //cintāmaṇi-dhāma// [Bs. 5.29]. These two //dhāmas,// places, are not ordinary places. Don't make //dhāma-aparādha.// As there are offenses against chanting the holy name, similarly, there are offenses in //dhāma,// that in the //dhāma// one should not perform any sinful activities in the //dhāma.// And in the //dhāma,// if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// then it increases thousand times. Similarly, in the //dhāma,// if you commit offenses, it increases thousand times. So //dhāma,// one should be very careful not to commit any sinful activities. Illicit sex or intoxication, meat-eating and gambling---these are the sinful activities. So Vṛndāvana-dhāma, //aprākṛta dhāma.// Those who are attached to //viṣaya,// sense gratification, they cannot see what is Vṛndāvana. They cannot see what is Vṛndāvana. They cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, those who are //viṣayī. Viṣaya// means //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. This is //viṣaya,// material objectives. They cannot. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings,

> viṣaya chāḍiyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana
> kabe hāma herava śrī-vṛndāvana

//Visaya chadiya,// one who has become detestful to this material enjoyment, they can see what is Vṛndāvana. Those who are attached to material enjoyment, they cannot see what is Vṛndāvana. These are the process.

> rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhabo sei yugala-pīriti

The ordinary artists, they are very much fond of painting pictures that Kṛṣṇa is embracing Rādhārāṇī. They won't paint picture in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness that Kṛṣṇa is killing Kaṁsa. Kṛṣṇa has two business: //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. So we should not try to understand Kṛṣṇa's love with the //gopīs// all of a sudden. It is very confidential. It is meant for the //paramahaṁsas// to understand. Let us understand Kṛṣṇa first of all. Of course, that is the aim, the higher understanding of Kṛṣṇa. //Gopī-bhāva-rasāmṛtābdhi-laharī-kallola-magnau// [//Śrī Ṣaḍ-gosvāmy-aṣṭaka// 4]. But not all of a sudden. Try to understand Kṛṣṇa first. Therefore Vyāsadeva has compiled //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// nine cantos to understand Kṛṣṇa, beginning from the First Canto, First Chapter, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]], //Vedānta// philosophy. Then he begins to write about Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's activities on the Tenth Canto. One has to understand Kṛṣṇa by studying nine cantos. Then if he tries to understand Kṛṣṇa from the Tenth Canto... Otherwise, the //mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam, avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. "Kṛṣṇa is like us, a young boy, and He's after so many young girls. So let us imitate." No. That is not understanding of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa must be understood:

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

When you understand Kṛṣṇa in that way, then, if you follow the footsteps of the //ācāryas, śrī-rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti,// then you'll be able to understand what is the loving affairs between Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī. Don't try to understand all of a sudden like ordinary boy and girl making their loving affairs. Then you'll fall down.

So this is my request, that you have come to Vṛndāvana; try to understand what is Vṛndāvana-dhāma, what is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, but very cautiously, very, I mean to say, carefully. Then Kṛṣṇa will be pleased. And Kṛṣṇa Himself, as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, He is present here. Go through //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsadi gaura...,// so in this way, gradually, you'll be able to understand. But that is the highest perfection. Some way or other, if you can understand Kṛṣṇa and His Vṛndāvana... //Ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanayas tad-dhāma vṛndāvanam.// If you... Kṛṣṇa and Vṛndāvana is nondifferent. Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's place, Kṛṣṇa's name, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, Kṛṣṇa's everything, they are not different. They are one. So this is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy, that //ārādhya-vastu,// the worshipable Lord, is Kṛṣṇa. And as He is worshipable, His //dhāma// is also worshipable. We should not commit any offense in the //dhāma,// and follow the footsteps of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then we'll be favored by the grace of Kṛṣṇa to understand Him and His pastimes with Rādhārāṇī.

Thank you very much.
