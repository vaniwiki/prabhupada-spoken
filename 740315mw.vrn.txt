**Prabhupāda:**
...you should call learned. //Arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. You take it...

**Nitāi:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...this quotation from //Padma Purāṇa,// and distribute it by transcribing to all our devotees.

**["One who thinks the Deity in the temple to be made of wood or stone, who thinks of the spiritual master in the disciplic succession as an ordinary man, who thinks the Vaiṣṇava in the Acyuta-gotra to belong to a certain caste or creed or who thinks of caraṇāmṛta or Ganges water as ordinary water is taken to be a resident of hell."]**

**Nitāi:**
That's the verse that says that one is a resident of hell...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Nārakī.//

**Nitāi:**
...if he considers the Deity...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nārakī.//

**Nitāi:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Arcye viṣṇau...// [break] ...when it will teach military art, with //tilaka,// soldiers will [chanting in marching beat], "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa..." [laughter] We want that. Marching with military band, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." You maintain this idea. Is it not good?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
When there will be military march of Kṛṣṇa conscious soldiers, anyone who does not believe in Kṛṣṇa, "//Blam!//" [laughter] Yes. The same process as the Muhammadans did with sword and Koran, we'll have to do that. "Do you believe in Kṛṣṇa or not?" "No, sir." "//Blam!//" Finished. [laughter; Prabhupāda laughs] What do you think, Madhudviṣa Mahārāja? Is that all right?

**Madhudviṣa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] What these Communists can do? We can do better than them. We can kill many Communists like that. [laughter] Then it will be counteraction of Communist movement. And you think like that. "Why you are sitting idly, no employment? Come on to the field. Take this plow. Take this bull. Go on working. Why you are sitting idly?" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Nobody should be allowed to sit down and sleep. They must find out some employment---either work as //brāhmaṇa// or as a //kṣatriya// or as a //vaiśya.// Why there should be unemployment? The same example: Just like I am..., this body is working. The leg is working, hand is working, brain is working, belly is working. Why there should be unemployment? You just stop this unemployment, you will see the whole world is peaceful; there is no complaint. And they'll very happily chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hmm? Nobody's working in this field. They're all drawn to the cities to work in the factory. Condemned civilization. That Communist emblem, what is that?

**Devotees:**
Hammer and sickle.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is good.

**Indian man:**
Yeah, good.

**Prabhupāda:**
But no hammer. Only this... What is called?

**Devotees:**
Sickle.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sickle. No hammer. That will be our emblem. Only sickle. Not hammer. The hammer has hammered the whole human civilization. So just make a counter-emblem. The Communists will appreciate.

**Devotee:**
Sickle and //tilaka.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
A sickle, and then a //tilaka.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is good idea. Guptajī? Come here. [Hindi]

**Gupta:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
Rascal civilization, rascal government. And people are transferred into rascals. [Hindi] //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Without //anna,// how they can live? There is no arrangement for //anna.// They're simply passing resolution, legislative laws. And no //anna.// Just see what kind of wretched government it is. Everywhere. There is no //anna. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni.// The first duty of government is to see that everyone is happy, without any anxiety. These preliminary necessities of life, //āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithunam,// there must be sufficient arrangement for these preliminary necessities of life. One must eat sumptuously. Not over-eating, indigestion---no---but he must have sufficient food to keep up the health. Similarly, he must have place to sleep. We, we are prepared to offer everything. And be Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is our mission. Not by eating and sleeping, become rogues and thieves and rascals. That we will not allow. That is //varṇāśrama-dharma.// [Hindi conversation, greeting Indian man] Why unemployment? There is no scarcity of water. Just have a big well. Electricity pump water. Oh, immediately it will be all green. Immediately. [Hindi conversation] [greeting passerby] //Jayo.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

[break] ...all round, for the benefit of the human society. You'll be honored everywhere. Everywhere, any part of the world. And automatically these bogus //avatāra,// incarnation, God, and //yogīs// and //svāmīs// will be all doomed. You see? These rascal society, //avatāra,// "Bhagavān," incarnation, //yogī,// these rascals will be doomed.

**Gupta:**
[indistinct] ought to be finished. They cannot remain.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. [Hindi] ...that glowworm. Glowworm [Hindi] beautiful [Hindi] darkness //hai.// [Hindi] So long people were in darkness, they were beautiful. Now there is sunshine.

**Gupta:**
Yes.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Prabhupāda is the sun.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] [break] ...the anxiety of Prahlāda Mahārāja, "How these rascals, who have made a plan for happiness of a few men, gorgeous plan." And they're... For happiness of the government servant, that's all. You know in Delhi there is Planning Commission? What is that plan? That people may starve, and Indira Gandhi and company may flourish. That's all.

**Gupta:**
I think, Mahārāja, they are coming to the office at twelve and going back at one, doing nothing, and only...

**Prabhupāda:**
But what they have got to do?

**Gupta:**
They are not doing anything...

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like I have seen in London, the Parliament. When they had some so-called empire... Now the Parliament is useless, useless. The Parliament members and the Lord, House of Lord, House of Commons, they are now useless. They have got some old books only, in Parliament. I have seen. Some old books. Old books means all the speeches are recorded in books. And who is going to read them? //Almirās,// so many... I have seen in Parliament. Hundreds and thousands of speeches recorded and bound up very nicely. Who is going to read them? Simply waste of time.

**Gupta:**
They are increasing the heavy load like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Gupta:**
They are increasing the load like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gupta:**
Donkey's load. Go on increasing, increasing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore this example is given: ass. For nothing, not for himself. He'll be given little grass. The grass is available here. But still, he's engaged. Employment. Ass will reap, eat little grass. Grass is available everywhere. But still, he'll work for others, loading, overloading. This is ass. He has no sense, "So why I have taken so much overload? I can get grass anywhere. Let me remain free." But he has no such sense. Neither he will be allowed. [laughs] This is ass. [//japa//]

[break] ...there are many //bābājīs,// they are collecting //cāpāṭis// and smoking //bīḍī,// and have one or two women. That's all. It is going on. So they should be drawn: "Come on! Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take the plow." Not that you become Rūpa Gosvāmī simply by smoking. They are thinking they have become Rūpa Gosvāmī. Rūpa Gosvāmī lived like that. So they think by changing the cloth, loincloth, they have become Rūpa Gosvāmī. And whatever nonsense they like, they can do. [break] ...be taken, and all these //bābājīs// should be employed, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and draw plow." Then it will be nice.

**Jayādvaita:**
In America too, the professors...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayādvaita:**
In America too, the big intellectuals and professors, they can also be... We can have plows for them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, because they're wasting time. Better produce some food. At least, your food. You are living at the cost of others. What is the value of your philosophy? That... To... In the //Bhagavad-gītā: etaj jñānam, tad ajñānaṁ yad anyathā// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.12]]]. To search out the Absolute Truth, that is //jñāna,// knowledge, philosophy. Anything else, that is //ajñānam.// [break] ... I think it is so that if you cannot use your plot of land, then it will go to the government. Is it not?

**Gupta:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So similarly, if the government cannot utilize, it come to us. We shall work. Is it not good?

**Gupta:**
Very good.

**Prabhupāda:**
There must be some law like that. The government has taken from the public because it is not being worked out. Now we shall work. Give us this land. [Hindi] "You have taken from the public. Why should you not give us?" So that there will be no question, even government does not, we shall go and occupy, occupy, and go on tilling. What the government will...? Public will support us.

**Gupta:**
Again it is being distributed to their relations, not for working. Then it will remain..

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Gupta:**
Again it is being distributed to their relations, those who are in the power, and then they do not work again.

**Prabhupāda:**
Again.

**Gupta:**
Then again it remains...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then whatever field is not being worked, we occupy them and begin to work. And invite all the unemployed, "Come and join us. We shall give you food, shelter, everything." [break] ...how Kṛṣṇa is setting example. Kṛṣṇa is saying that "I have already arranged the result of this fighting. Everyone will be killed." //Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin// [[books:bg:11:33|[Bg. 11.33]]]. But still, He is inducing Arjuna to work. Not that He's already [indistinct], "I am your friend, Kṛṣṇa. Everything will be done." "It will be done, but you have to work."

**Gupta:**
"You have to work." May be a friend or not.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is philosophy. Not that "Because I am friend, I will do, and you will sleep and get dysentery." No. You have to work. Everything is already arranged, but you must work. That is wanted. Otherwise, why Arjuna was induced to fight? Kṛṣṇa has already arranged. And Arjuna also: "Yes." //Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]: "Whatever you say..." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break] ...politician, Balavanta? He's not here. So let him preach that "We shall, if you take our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, there will be no unemployment." He can at least give this manifesto to the..., "There will be no more unemployment." People will be very nice, very glad to hear. Now this machine, this machine nonsense, means unemployment. One machine will work for hundred men. So hundred men becomes unemployed, and one technician, he gets all the salaries. To work on the computer, com...

**Devotee:**
Computer, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Machine. And he's very expert. He'll take three thousand dollar. And others will be unemployed. This is going on. And they are thinking, "Advancement of civilization." Advancement of civilization means "Exploit others and you become happy." This is advancement of civilization. "Others may die for such..., out of starvation, and one man takes all the money and spends it for wine and woman and motorcar." That's all. This is advancement of civilization. //Sarve sukhino bhavantu.// This is Vedic civilization. "Let everyone be happy." That is Vedic civilization. And the demonic civilization, they're: "Let everyone suffer; I become happy. That's all." And Vaiṣṇava is thinking, "For my salvation it is all guaranteed." But he is thinking, "How these poor people will be saved?" //Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. Prahlāda Mahārāja. This is Vaiṣṇava's position. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// He's unhappy by seeing others unhappy. For himself, he has no unhappiness. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī. Kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. This is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. Vaiṣṇava shall work hard, undergo all tribulation, for others. He has no problem. A Vaiṣṇava has no problem. Because he has taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, he has no problem. //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. Kṛṣṇa also gives guarantee, "Anyone who has taken shelter of My..., he is saved. I will give him protection." Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ mokṣayiṣyāmi sarva...// Everything is there. For Vaiṣṇava there is no suffering, personally. But he is very much anxious, "How these rascals will be happy?" That is his business. "These rascals are misled. They are going astray, unhappy. So how they should be happy?" So that is Vaiṣṇava's business. So the Vaiṣṇava, therefore, will have no politics. Politics means planning for one's own happiness. That is politics. So in our society there should be no diplomacy, no politics. Everyone should be eager how to do good to others. That is Vaiṣṇava. If he's planning something, that "I shall be leader," "I shall be doing something," that is not Vaiṣṇavism. That politics is not good.

**Devotee:**
It seems that people are so attached to sense gratification, if we tell them we want to stop all these facilities for drinking, cinema, women, like that, they become angry.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that..., that is natural. If you give good instruction to a rascal, he'll be angry. //Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopayati na śantayi. Mūrkha,// a rascal, if you give him good instruction... But give him practical: "Come here. Sit down. Take //prasādam.// Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And help me by doing this." In this way you have to... Just like a child. Child does not want to go to school, but some, by... Find out some means so that he'll be induced. That is intelligence. He'll be angry, naturally. He's a rascal. He'll be angry. That is not unnatural. //Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopayati na śantayi.// Just like a snake.

You feed the snake with milk. It will increase the poison, that's all. Practically attract. Practically attract. That is the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement will practically attract the people. //Hare Kṛṣṇa,// shall we go back? If the world affairs are adjusted according to our Kṛṣṇa conscious plan, there will be no difficulty for all the nations, all the countries. They will be happy. So we have to educate people gradually. And by our example, living example, you'll have to attract. [pause]

**Local people:**
[calling out in distance] Harilāljī! Harilāljī!

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// At least they are remembering Harilāljī by seeing us. So much benefit has been done. Eh?

**Gupta:**
When we pass, people say "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma." [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the test of Vaiṣṇava. If one is actually Vaiṣṇava, then by seeing him one will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This has been created all over the world. Yes. Wherever we go, they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Even at midnight in Athens. Yes. That we have experienced. This is the definition given by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

**Jayādvaita:**
Prabhupāda, if Kṛṣṇa had already done all the work at Kurukṣetra, so why was He so eager to have Arjuna work?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayādvaita:**
Because He'd already done the work.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayādvaita:**
Why did He want Arjuna to work?

**Prabhupāda:**
Just to show example, that "Don't sit idly, rascal. Work." Kṛṣṇa has already done, but you must work. This is the example.

**Jayādvaita:**
People will argue that "Why should we work? If we can make an arrangement for being idle..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayādvaita:**
People argue that "If we can make an arrangement to be idle, then it's nice. We've worked so hard. Now we can be idle. That's nice."

**Prabhupāda:**
Then that, if you become idle, you'll be diseased. You'll have dysentery. That's all. That will not help you. You'll have to suffer. That, that, that stage has already come. Because so many rascals are idle, now there is so many things want. So you'll suffer. If you don't work, then you'll suffer. Yes... [end]
