**Prabhupāda:**
...by enjoying this morning fresh air.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And if you take bath in the Yamunā, you will get double energy. These are nature's gifts. And then we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// It is not at all difficult. To live a spiritual life, very easy.

[break] this... [break]... take photo.

**Gurudāsa:**
Oh, I can do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
All sides.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if somebody can manufacture by seeing the photograph in Jaipur, that's all right. Otherwise we shall test. [break] ...some marble statues, by seeing the morning. [break] ...actual measurement.

**Gurudāsa:**
Oh. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...our //gṛhastha// householders, how they are rising early, taking bath in Yamunā, coming to the temple.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is Vedic culture. [break] ...of eating. Western culture means early in the morning, tea. First of all tea, and..., what is called?

**Devotee:**
Coffee.

**Prabhupāda:**
Coffee, tea, and so many other things.

**Devotee:**
Oh, toast. Toast.

**Prabhupāda:**
Toast. And they will, their evacuation will be stopped. As soon as the belly is loaded... But they are accustomed. After eating they are evacuate not easily. [break] ...for //sevaita// sake. It is for the Kanpur-//wala.// [break] ...then there is no question of fighting; otherwise we shall take criminal and civil [indistinct].

[break] ...seven hundred.

**Gurudāsa:**
Seven hundred. [break] ...renovate these rooms, or just in general?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? General.

**Gurudāsa:**
General.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That veranda, that, whatever he likes we shall..., we will spend. We'll pay the bills and everything.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...to give us the temple portion free, and purchase the land for balance. [break] ...negotiate. But we have no sufficient men to manage. [break] ...unless you can utilize.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is fifty... fifty //lakhs,// twenty-five, that is beyond us. We can spare up to two //lakhs,// that's all. [break] ...be able to manage? [break] ...people.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. The Britishers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Britishers, they train. Just like in India, they trained. They were on the head of the administration. The Viceroy, the governor, the secretaries, the military commander, they are all Englishmen. All other, Indians. Therefore Gandhi started non-cooperation movement, that "These people are ruling over us by our cooperation."

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So "Non-cooperate with them, they will fail." And that was successful. He started non-cooperation movement, that "Don't cooperate with these Britishers." And when they saw there is now full non-cooperation, they left voluntarily. It is not possible to bring so many administrators, military strength, men, and too. Actually the British empire was expanded through the help of Indians.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, they did all the work.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
Actually, if the British were more intelligent they could have continued.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
Just like that mutiny. The grease was used in the guns, and the //brāhmaṇas// mutinied?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is propaganda. [looking at ground] Now, this is urine?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see nonsense.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who has passed this thing? [break] ...then other qualities.

**Gurudāsa:**
Truthfulness.

**Prabhupāda:**
Truthfulness and cleanliness. //Satyaṁ śaucam.//

**Gurudāsa:**
//Satyaṁ śaucam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Samaḥ damaḥ titikṣavaḥ ārjavaṁ jñānaṁ vijñānam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. You do not read //Bhagavad-gītā?// You are publishing for selling. It will be read by others; we are simply to make money? These are in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Don't you read it?

**Devotee:**
Yes, I read it. The qualities of a //brāhmaṇa// is given, along with the qualities of all the other //varṇas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
We have..., taking sacred thread has qualities less than //śūdra. Camaras,// cobblers. //Camara// means expert in skin. "I am white," "I am black," "I am this," "I am that," that is //camara.// Expert in skin. [break] People are very receptive?

**Devotee:**
Yes, especially Gujarati and Marwari communities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Devotee:**
The South Indians, they are not so receptive. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...men, so everyone should be very alert in their behavior. Rising early in the morning, taking bath, be prepared for //maṅgala āratik// immediately. Then class. Everything in regulated way. [break] ...and still everyone comes to the point, "I know everything." This point.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
On the basis of //Bhagavad-gītā,// then nobody can supercede. [break] ...he turns back all our money invested, with these people. [break] ...if he's prepared to pay double the price, so why not pay the full price, fourteen //lakhs?// We have paid two //lakhs;// let him pay twelve //lakhs,// and he'll immediately transfer, and we'll take double price from him, so that... [break] ...if he's so eager. These, these are practical. If he's prepared to pay double, why not pay us? [break] [end]
