====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 2.1.1 ======

**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of verse, etc.] [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat]

Translation: "Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: My dear King, your question is glorious because it is very beneficial to all kinds of people. To hear the answer to this question is the prime subject matter of hearing, and it is approved by all transcendentalists."

**Prabhupāda:**

> varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ
> kṛto loka-hitaṁ nṛpa
> ātmavit-sammataḥ puṁsāṁ
> śrotavyādiṣu yaḥ paraḥ
> [[books:sb:2:1:1|[SB 2.1.1]]]

//Śrotavyādiṣu yaḥ paraḥ.// The... Here in this material world we are busy in questioning and answering or hearing. Question, hearing and answering. This is the whole world. Even in the material field, you go to the market, you inquire, "What is the price of this thing?" and you hear the description of the thing and the price of the thing. So the //praśnaḥ,// the question, was made by Śukadeva..., Mahārāja Parīkṣit just at the point of his death, "What I have to do now?" This is very intelligent. Only intelligent man can understand what is the value of this question, "What I have to do now?" Because intelligent person knows that "I am going to leave this body."

I am speaking... Parīkṣit Mahārāja is talking with Śukadeva Gosvāmī at the point of death. He was given notice that "Within seven days you'll be bitten by a snake and you'll die." This was a curse by a //brāhmaṇa// boy. So he was ready. He was not afraid. //Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati// [[books:sb:6:17:28|[SB 6.17.28]]]. He could retaliate. He was a great devotee. He could counteract the cursing of the //brāhmaṇa// boy, but he did not do so. Because, because he was cursed, the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// came. He was perplexed what to do, and Śukadeva Gosvāmī appeared there, and everyone accepted the verdict of Śukadeva Gosvāmī, "Mahārāja, you are a great devotee. So I shall quote from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and you hear only. That's all. You have nothing to do. Simply you hear."

> arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ

> [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]

These are the nine different processes of devotional service. So generally, we are expected to execute all the nine different processes, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ... Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam// about Viṣṇu, not for any other demigods. No. Viṣṇu. The Māyāvādīs, they take it that "We can hear of any demigod, of anyone," because they are //nirākāravādī.// So "You can imagine anyone and hear about him." But //śāstra// does not say. //Śāstra// does not say that you can hear about anybody. No. //Śāstra// says, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ,// about Viṣṇu.

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

This is the //śāstra's// injunction, that if you have to chant..., if you have not to chant, means you must chant. //Kalau nāsty eva gatir anyathā.// You cannot avoid it. If you actually want relief from this conditional life, //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]], then you must... This is the only means. //Kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā. Karma, jñāna, yoga,// there are different processes of self-realization, //karma, jñāna, yoga,// but it is stressed, //nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva,// not //karma,// not //jñāna,// not //yoga.// Simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is required. That is the preaching of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this, this verse of //Agni Purāṇa://

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

So this is the //bhakti// process, chanting and hearing. So chanting, hearing, or questioning and answering, the same thing. So when Parīkṣit Mahārāja was perplexed what to do at the time of death, so many great sages and saintly persons, //brāhmaṇas,// they came there, because the king is going to die. So not only of this planet, from other planets also, many, many exalted person came. Somebody prescribed something, somebody prescribed something. So he was perplexed. Fortunately, Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī arrived there, and he advised, "Mahārāja, you simply hear //harer nāma,// the name, the form, the quality, the pastimes. About Kṛṣṇa, you simply hear." That was the... Therefore... And Parīkṣit Mahārāja was a devotee from the very beginning of his life. He's a grandson of Arjuna and Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. Naturally, he was //kṛṣṇa-bhakta.// He..., Kṛṣṇa was his grandmother's brother also. There was family relation. And he studied thoroughly... Although when he was born he did not see Kṛṣṇa, but still, he knew that Kṛṣṇa saved the whole Pāṇḍava family.

Kṛṣṇa, when //brahmāstra// was released by Aśvatthāmā to kill the Mahārāja Parīkṣit while he was within the womb of his mother, Kṛṣṇa personally saved him. Because He wanted... Because in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, everyone died, of the Kuru dynasty. Only the son, this Abhimanyu's son, Kṛṣṇa, uh, Arjuna's grandson, was within the womb of his mother; therefore he was not killed in the battlefield. Still, Aśvatthāmā, the son of Droṇācārya wanted to kill him, and he released //brahmāstra,// and it was going to kill the child. At that time his mother, Uttarā, approached Kṛṣṇa, that "I am feeling that my womb will be..., abortion there may be." So Kṛṣṇa saved. This is the history. So after his birth, because he saw Kṛṣṇa within the womb, so after his birth, as soon as he came out of the womb of his mother, he was looking here and there, "Where is that personality?" Therefore his name is Parīkṣit. Parīkṣit means he was examining, "Who is that? Who is that man?"

So Parīkṣit Mahārāja was so fortunate. So fortunate. From the very beginning of his life, he saw Kṛṣṇa. Just like this child. These are fortunate children. //Yoginām...// That... //Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sanjāyate// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. This child who was dancing before me, he's not ordinary child. Otherwise, how he could dance symmetrically? He had his practice in his previous life, and he has got the chance to get Vaiṣṇava father and mother, and from the very beginning of his life, he is chanting, dancing. So Parīkṣit Mahārāja was like that. So to get the chance of having good father, //śucīnāṁ... Śucīnām// means //brāhmaṇa-vaiṣṇava,// especially //brāhmaṇa.// And //śrīmatām. Śrīmatām// means very rich. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has given his comment: //śucīnām// means highly cultured //brāhmaṇa,// and //śrīmatām// means highly rich //vaiśya.// So to take birth in this family, cultured family, rich family, is not ordinary thing. It is not ordinary thing. It is the result of pious activities. Pious activities. The pious activities means you get your birth in a very good, aristocratic family, rich family or //brāhmaṇa// family. That is the result of pious activities. You become very beautiful. You become very learned. //Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]]. Four things: //Janma// means birth. //Aiśvarya// means riches, wealth. //Aiśvarya. Janma aiśvarya// and //śruta. Śruta// means education. To become learned man, to become very educated, that is also a result of pious activities. To take birth in rich family, that is also result of pious activities. To become very beautiful, that is also result of pious activities. //Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrībhir edhamāna-madaḥ pumān.//

Unfortunately... When we get these opportunities, very nice family or nice nation, beautiful body, education, we should consider that it is due to our past pious activities; therefore they should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa. Because pious activities means to approach Kṛṣṇa. Those who are impious, sinful, they cannot approach Kṛṣṇa. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. Those who are //narādhamāḥ,// lowest of the mankind, always engaged in sinful activities, and rascal, may be very educated---//māyayā apahṛta-jñānāḥ,// their educational value has been taken away by //māyā.// As, just like nowadays it has become: the more one is educated, the more one is atheist. We have received one report just now, Bombay. They are... That singing, Hare Kṛṣṇa singing, "Nuisance," they say. You see. How degraded human being has become: "Hare Kṛṣṇa singing is nuisance. And cinema singing is very good." Just see. They have become simply rascals, dogs and hogs. Simply.

So we should be very much careful of our next birth. Because... //Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]]. This is the verdict of Kṛṣṇa. At the time of death, whatever thought is there, you get next birth a similar body. The mind, mind creates the body, gross body. As we have got this gross body, so within this gross body there is the subtle body: mind, intelligence and ego. These rascals, they do not know that when the gross body is annihilated, it does not mean that the soul is finished. No. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. This is the verdict. Don't think because the gross body is now finished, therefore the person is finished. No. The person is there within the subtle body, and the subtle body will carry him. Just like the fragrance is carried by the air: You cannot see what is this fragrance, but you can smell. A very good smell, wherefrom it came? That is subtle carrying. Similarly, the soul is carried after annihilation of this body, gross body, material. Mind, intelligence, ego---that is also material, but subtle. You cannot see. Everyone knows that I have got mind, I have got soul, but you cannot see. Neither I can see. But there is. But one who does not know what is soul, what is subtle body, they become perplexed. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //dhīras tatra na muhyati. Dhīra,// those who are sober, one who knows how things are going on, //dhīras tatra na muhyati.//

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
> tathā dehāntara-prāptir
> dhīras tatra na muhyati
> [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]

So one has to become //dhīra.// These, nowadays, the modern civilization is a rascaldom. Everyone is //adhīra.// He does not know... In the Western countries, big, big professors, they do not know how the soul is existing, how the transmigration of the soul is taking place, how the body is changed, what is the purpose of life, what is the perfection of... Nothing they... Simply like cats and dogs. Work very hard like an ass and enjoy like cats and dogs, //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca sāmānyam etat paśubhir narāṇām// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. This life is most degraded life, that at the present moment we see that people are suffering because they have simply become animals, all over the world. Simply taking care of this body. But here Parīkṣit Mahārāja, now he knows that "Taking part of the body is now finished; I have to take care of the soul." Therefore he wanted to ask from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, "Now what I have to do? Shall I fully think of Kṛṣṇa?" Because he was a Kṛṣṇa devotee. Naturally, he was thinking of Kṛṣṇa. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. A devotee, he always thinks of Kṛṣṇa. That is devotee.

So we have to practice: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. This is the chance. This is the chance for remembering Kṛṣṇa. //Satataṁ smartavyaṁ viṣṇum.// Viṣṇu, Lord Kṛṣṇa or Lord Viṣṇu, has to be remembered always. Here... The //śloka// is there: //tasmād bhārata sarvātmā.//

> tasmād bhārata sarvātmā
> bhagavān īśvaro hariḥ
> śrotavyaḥ kīrtitavyaś ca
> smartavyaś cecchatābhayam
> [[books:sb:2:1:5|[SB 2.1.5]]]

//Icchatā abhayam. Abhayam// means fearlessness. One should be... //Abhayaṁ sattva-saṁśuddhiḥ.// There are three necessities..., four necessities of conditioned life: eating, sleeping, mating and fearing. So one has to become //abhayam,// no more fear. How? When you take shelter of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet. //Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati// [[books:sb:6:17:28|[SB 6.17.28]]]. If you take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then... Therefore Parīkṣit Mahā..., er, Śukadeva Gosvāmī: //icchatā abhayam.// Those who are actually willing to become fearless, hero, they must always... //Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]], always chanting and hearing about Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for that purpose, to become //abhayam,// no more fear. Why one should fear? Kṛṣṇa assures, //kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]].

So if we take shelter of the supreme //abhayam,// Kṛṣṇa... Therefore one Vaiṣṇava //kavi// has sung, //bhaja huṅ re mana śrī-nanda-nandana, abhaya-caraṇāravinda re. Abhaya-caraṇa.// Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet is to become free from fearfulness. //Bhaja huṅ re mana śrī-nanda-nandana.// Particularly //śrī-nanda-nandana. Nanda-nandana// means that Kṛṣṇa has got many forms: Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha, then Viṣṇu, Mahā-Viṣṇu. //Ananta. Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. But His real form is in Vṛndāvana, the son of Nanda Mahārāja. Therefore he is advising, //bhaja huṅ re mana śrī-nanda-nandana.// Kṛṣṇa... There are Māyāvādī philosopher, they say that the Absolute Truth, the Supreme, has no name. Yes, for the persons with poor fund of knowledge, they may not find out Kṛṣṇa's name. But in the //śāstra// we have got thousands of name, //viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma.// But what are those name? Name means His behavior with His devotees. Just like "Nanda-nandana." Kṛṣṇa is the father of everyone---//ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]---everyone. So how He has got a father? Oh, that is His mercy. He accepts one devotee as His father. And when He's addressed in relationship with His devotee... Nanda Mahārāja wanted Kṛṣṇa as his son. Kṛṣṇa agreed, "Yes, I shall become your son." So everyone, if you want Kṛṣṇa as your son... Not to become God, but to become the father of God. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they want to become God. But we Vaiṣṇava, we want to become the father of God. This is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. Father of God means he controls God. He's not controlled by God. So a devotee can get such position. Everyone is being controlled by God, but a devotee is so exalted that Kṛṣṇa says that "I wish to be controlled by you." This is Kṛṣṇa's position. Therefore the Vaiṣṇava //kavi// advises, //bhaja huṅ re mana śrī-nanda-nandana, abhaya-caraṇāravinda re. Durlabha mānava..., durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge taraha e// [Govinda Dāsa Kavirāja].

Now we have got this human form of body, //durlabha,// very, very rare. This human form of body is obtained after many millions of years. Not very easily. Because we had to come through the evolutionary process, 8,400,0000 species of life. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati// [Padma Purāṇa]. Therefore this human form of life should not be wasted. Here is the solution of all the problems of life. Don't neglect it. Therefore it is advised, //durlabha mānava-janama sat-saṅge taraha e bhava-sindhu re. E bhava-sindhu.// This is the ocean, this is the ocean of nescience, ignorance. What is that? //Bhava. Bhava-sindhu// means take birth again and again, //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. This is very botheration. And there is no guarantee what kind of... Therefore Parīkṣit Mahārāja... He's also devotee. He's going to Vaikuṇṭha. There was no doubt about it. Still, for our lesson, he inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī that "What is my duty now, now I am going to die?" This is intelligence.

So Parīkṣit Mahārāja had a notice of death for seven days, but we do not know what is the notice. We can die immediately. So how much for us it is necessary to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Parīkṣit Mahārāja had some time. This //Bhāgavata-saptāha// is imitated under Parīkṣit Mahārāja's... Parīkṣit Mahārāja had only seven days' time, so he might have listened to the //Bhāgavata// lesson for seven days. But for us, it is not that we observe a //Bhāgavata-saptāha// and finish our business. No. Our business is //nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.//

> nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā
> [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]

//Nityam.// Not that for seven days. Seven days is meant for Parīkṣit Mahārāja, because he had no more time. His seven days was sufficient //nityam.// So we should not imitate that, that "I'll hear seven days." That is also a formality. Actually, to understand one verse of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it requires at least seven months. //Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. My Guru Mahārāja explained this verse in Dacca for three months, //janmādy asya.// Actually, it is so important. The beginning.

So we must be very serious to understand //Bhāgavatam.// If we can understand even one line, one verse, our life becomes sublime. It is so nice. There is no comparison of this literature, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// That we are actually finding in the Western countries, how nicely they are receiving these //granthas.// We have translated into English, and they're enjoying. Actually that is the fact. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.// Now, our problem, what is this problem? Problem is that we have got so many dirty things within the heart. The first dirty thing is that "I am this body." "I am Indian," "I am Englishman," "I am American," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //kṣatriya,//" "I am //śūdra,//" "I am fat," "I am thin," "I am black" and "White..." These conceptions, these are all dirty things. "I am not this body," that is real knowledge. Therefore Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. To cleanse the dirty things from the heart, that is my first business. And what is that dirty things? To identity myself with this body. That is the dirty things.

The whole world is in distressed condition on account of this dirty thing, that "I am this body." This is the conception of the ass. It is said in the...

> [SB 10.84.13]

//Go-kharaḥ. Go-kharaḥ// means... //Go// means cow, and //kharaḥ// means ass. //Yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile.// Now many persons come here in Vṛndāvana, //tīrtha,// but what do they think? They think, "Let me take bathing in the Yamunā River. Then my business is finished." But no. //Śāstra// says that you should approach to a //bhāgavata,// a devotee who is living in Vṛndāvana, pure devotee, and surrender unto him. That is //tīrtha-yātrā.// Not that coming here and taking bathing in the Ganges or... They are going to //dūre vāry-ayanaṁ tīrtham.// General people think, in this Kali-yuga at least, that if you go thousand miles away from your home, then your //tīrtha// is finished. Just like in Calcutta there is Ganges, but people come to Haridwar to take bathing in the Ganges. Now, what is the difference between the Haridwar Ganges and Calcutta Ganges? But he thinks, "If I go three thousand miles and take bathing there, that is real Ganges." So //dūre vāry-ayanaṁ tīrtham.// These are the symptoms of the Kali-yuga. //Yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicit.// Many thousands of people come to Vṛndāvana, but they think by taking bathing in the Yamunā, his //tīrtha// is finished. Or going to Prayāga, taking bath... Christian also, they go. They take bathing in the...? Water of...? Jordan?

**Devotee:**
Jordan River.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So... No. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. If you have to cleanse your heart from all misgivings, then you have to do this: //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. You hear about Kṛṣṇa. Where? Kṛṣṇa is speaking about Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā:// "I am this. I am that." You hear. Or you hear about Kṛṣṇa from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.// So if you hear... Kṛṣṇa is within your heart. He can understand. If you are seriously hearing, then Kṛṣṇa can understand. Not that //karma-kāṇḍīya-vicāra.// "Let me hear on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// for seven days, and I'll get... I have got now one //lakh// of rupees; I'll get three //lakhs.//" That is //karma-kāṇḍīya-vicāra.// That is not wanted. The hearing of //Bhāgavatam// means to cleanse your heart, that you are not this body, you are spirit soul, eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. That is purification. When you come to this understanding, that "I am not this body. I am spirit... //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi,//" then... //Brahmāsmi,// finished? The Māyāvādī says as soon as you come to this conclusion, //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// then your business is finished. No. Your business begins there. That is the verdict of //Bhagavad-gītā.//

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

After being liberated, //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// then //bhakti// begins. People misunderstand that by //bhakti// one gets //mukti.// No. One who is engaged in //bhakti,// he is always... He has already got //mukti. Muktir mukulitāñjali sevate 'smān.// Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura says that if one has attained to the platform of //bhakti,// then //mukti// is hankering after his feet: "What can I do for you?" //Muktiḥ svayaṁ mukulitāñjali sevate 'smān dharmārtha-kāma-gatayaḥ samaya-pratīkṣāḥ// [//Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta// 107].

So //bhakti// is above //mukti.// Therefore a pure devotee does not aspire for //mukti.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. //Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye, mama janmani janmani.// He says, //janmani janmani. Janmani,// when He says //janmani,// it is not //mukti.// Because //mukti// means you stop your material transmigration from one body to another. That is //mukti.// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //mama janmani janmani.// A devotee doesn't require //mukti. Janmani janmani tvayi bhaktiḥ.// If you are situated in the devotional service of the Lord, then you are already //mukta. Avyabhicāriṇī.//

> yo māṁ bhakti-yogena
> vyabhicāreṇa sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

//Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā...// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. This is the verdict. So for a devotee, //mukti// is not very big thing. //Mukti's// already there if he's actually a pure devotee. A pure devotee means just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu says. He has no other desire. //Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīm// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. Everyone is desiring in this material world for riches, wealth, //dhanam,// and //janam,// good family, high aristocratic family, or good follower, leader, minister, //janam;// they are aspiring popular votes. //Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitām.// And next is to have a very beautiful, obedient wife. These are the aspirations of material life. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "I do not want all these things." //Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīm.// This is //bhakti// life. When one is free from all such material desire, he's fit for executing devotional service. That is //mukti.//

Therefore we have to cleanse our heart. Our heart is always aspiring how to get money, how to get women, how to get prestige, how to become leader, how to become minister, how to become //guru.// These are the things always hankering in our heart. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. First of all cleanse your heart. And that is also said in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// that //naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. //Nityam.// Not seven days. //Nityam.// Read every day, especially those who are in Vṛndāvana. Every day, as much as possible, read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā. Nityam.// Then our heart will be cleansed, and we shall know what is our constitutional position, what is our relationship with Kṛṣṇa, and then if we serve in that relationship, our life is perfect.

So here Parīkṣit Mahārāja asked that "Shall I think of Kṛṣṇa, or I shall hear about Kṛṣṇa?" And Śukadeva Gosvāmī's congratulating him, //varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:1|[SB 2.1.1]]]: "Yes, it is very nice." //Varīyān,// first class, glorious. //Varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ kṛto loka-hitam.// "Now, your question is so nice that when I shall answer, it will be beneficial for the whole universe, //loka-hitam.//" //Loka-hitam.// Because this //Bhāgavata// is so nice, transcendental subject matter discussed about Kṛṣṇa, it is //loka-hitam.// It should be spread all over the world. //Loka// does not mean your country or your society, //brāhmaṇa// society, //gosvāmī// society. No. //Loka-hitam:// for the benefit of the whole world. That is //loka-hitam.// Not only of this world, but other worlds also---of the whole universe. //Loka-hitaṁ nṛpa.// "My dear King, your //praśna...//" So this message of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// should be spread all over the world. //Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]. //Na ca tasmāt manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. Don't make it stagnant, that "This //Bhāgavata// is meant for a certain class of men, and it is to be recited by certain professional men, and make some money, and provide your family, and you become... //Bās.// Very good, religious." No. //Loka-hitam. Bhāgavata// should be spread.

That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. //Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. Whole world, whomever you meet, you speak of Kṛṣṇa. That is //guru.// That is //gosvāmī.// Not that //gosvāmī// profession means that I make a means of my livelihood: I bring money from outside and engage in my son's marriage and daughter's marriage. That is not //gosvāmī.// One who is engaged in //loka-hitam,// spreading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// all over the world, that is //gosvāmī. Gosvāmī// means... //Go// means //indriya; svāmī// means... //Indriya// means senses, and //svāmī// means the master. One has to control. If one is busy only family matters... What is this family? It is simply sense gratification, sexual intercourse. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. So if one is engaged in these family affairs only, sexual affairs, he's not a //gosvāmī. Gosvāmī// means who has..., one who has... Wherefrom this //gosvāmī// comes? Rūpa Gosvāmī. //Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva...// They, they were not family men. They were not in sense gratification. They were in the service of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa. That is //gosvāmī.// We must know what is //gosvāmī. Loka-hitaṁ ratam.// Everyone who is on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is engaged to preach //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā,// throughout the whole world... //Pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt.// A //gosvāmī// means he must have disciples all over the world. That is //gosvāmī.// Not that within some area. These are the things. We should scrutinizingly study what is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// what is //Bhagavad-gītā,// what is a preacher, what is //gosvāmī.// These things we must study. //Loka-hi...// These will be discussed by Śukadeva Gosvāmī, that what is what. You'll find in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

Therefore it is our duty: //nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā. Nityam.// Not that seven days. //Nityam. Naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. First of all we have to hear. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ.// We acquire pious result of hearing. And the result will be manifested... //Hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi...//

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛt satām
> [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]

Then he must be free from the material bondage. That is called //hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi vidhunoti//---washed off. If it is not completely washed off, if it is partially washed off, //naṣṭa-prāyeṣu... Naṣṭa-prāya// means we have got all these filthy things within the heart. It is not yet cleansed fully, but even some percentage is cleansed, then... //Nityaṁ bhāgavata...// But how it can be cleansed? The process is to hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// That will be explained:

> śrotavyādīni rājendra
> nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ
> apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ
> gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām
> [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]

These verse are very nice, I mean to say, instructive verses, and you try to read them regularly, every morning. Or whenever you find time. Then you will understand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Everything is explained there. Then the dirty things in our heart will be cleansed, and then we will understand what is our constitutional position, and what is our duty, and how to execute it.

Thank you very much.
