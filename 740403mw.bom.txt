**Prabhupāda:**
But if one cannot execute in such a way, he can take little fruits. That's all.

**Dr. Patel:**
[laughs] Shall we? [break] //...Śṛnu me paramaṁ vacaḥ// [[books:bg:10:1|[Bg. 10.1]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhūya.// He has already spoken so many important things; still, He wants to give information of further important part.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Yat te 'haṁ priyamāṇāya vakṣyāmi hita-kāmyayā// [[books:bg:10:1|[Bg. 10.1]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "Because these things are to be spoken to My dear devotees, //priyamāṇāya,// for the special benefit of the devotees, not for the ordinary man." //Bhūya eva mahā-bāho// [[books:bg:10:1|[Bg. 10.1]]]. //Mahā-bāho,// this word is used, "mighty-armed," who is very strong in devotional service. //Mahā-bāho. Bhūya eva mahā-bāho śṛṇu me paramaṁ vacaḥ.//" //Mahā-bāho:// because you are My great devotee, therefore I am speaking further, very important subject matter." Next line?

**Dr. Patel:**

> na me viduḥ sura-ganaḥ
> prabhavaṁ na maharṣayaḥ
> aham ādir hi devānāṁ
> maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ
> [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Even the... //Na me viduḥ sura-gaṇāḥ. Sura-gaṇāḥ// means demigods, and what to speak of the rascals? How the rascals, simply by little educational qualification, can understand Kṛṣṇa?

**Dr. Patel:**
//Prabhavaṁ,// the original, He said. //Prabhavaṁ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Prabhavaṁ// means influence, influence. //Prabhāva.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Aham ādir hi devānāṁ maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, just try to understand this. //Na me viduḥ sura-gaṇāḥ// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. [Hindi] ...demigods, big, big demigods, they cannot understand Him. How the rascals with little education can understand? This is the meaning. //Na me viduḥ sura-gaṇāḥ prabhavaṁ.// How much influence... The //maharṣayaḥ,// big, big saintly //ṛṣis// also, they cannot understand. //Aham ādir hi devānām. Devānām// means the first //devas:// the Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara. So Viṣṇu is He Himself. Even Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, they do not know. //Devānām.//

**Dr. Patel:**

> yo mām ajam anādiṁ ca
> vetti loka-maheśvaram
> asamūḍhaḥ sa martyeṣu
> sarva-papaiḥ pramucyate
> [[books:bg:10:3|[Bg. 10.3]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is the understanding of Kṛṣṇa. //Yo mām ajam. Ajam.// "Because Kṛṣṇa appears as born of Vasudeva and Devaki..." That is //mūrkha.// He appears. He appears, //ajo 'pi sann avyayātmā bhūtānām īśvaro 'pi san, sambhavāmi// [[books:bg:4:6|[Bg. 4.6]]]. That is His extraordinary power. [aside:] //Aiye...// But when one understands that He is //aja,// there is no birth of Kṛṣṇa... //Aja,// and...?

**Dr. Patel:**
//Maheśvaram.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Maheśvaram, mahā īśvaram.// There are //īśvaras,// but //parameśvara,// or //mahā-īśvara,// that is Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
Shall I read further?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> buddhir jñānam asammohaḥ
> kṣamā satyaṁ damaḥ śamaḥ
> sukhaṁ duḥkhaṁ bhavo 'bhāvo
> bhayaṁ cābhayam eva ca

> ahiṁsā samatā tuṣṭis
> tapo dānaṁ yaśo 'yaśaḥ
> bhavanti bhāvā bhūtānāṁ
> matta eva pṛthag-vidhāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:4-5|[Bg. 10.4-5]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. All these good qualities, they are also coming from Him. //Matta eva.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Good and bad, all qualities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There is no bad. There is nothing bad, but...

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhava abhāva bhayaṁ ca abhayaṁ ca.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhayaṁ ca abhayaṁ ca,// contradictory, yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Contradictory qualities.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means all contradictions can be adjusted in Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**

> maharṣayaḥ sapta pūrve
> catvāro manavas tathā
> mad-bhāvā mānasā jātā
> yeṣāṁ loke imāḥ prajāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:6|[Bg. 10.6]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "The whole //prajā,// population, they are born of Me."

**Dr. Patel:**

> etāṁ vibhūtiṁ yogaṁ ca
> mama yo vetti tattvataḥ
> so 'vikalpena yogena
> yujyate nātra saṁśayaḥ
> [[books:bg:10:7|[Bg. 10.7]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //tattvataḥ,// to understand Kṛṣṇa //tattvataḥ.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Rightly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is the actually essence of //Bhagavad-gītā. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:// "I am the origin of everything." //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo// and //mattaḥ sarvam. Sarvam// means including Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara. //Sarvam. Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate iti matvā.// One who understands this. //Bhajante.// So just... The //bhajana// is for whom? //Iti matvā.// When one understands that Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything, even the original demigods, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara, when one understands perfectly this thing, then his //bhajana// is perfect.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhāva, bhāva. Bhāva// means...

**Chandobhai:**
All the emotions, feelings.

**Prabhupāda:**
...love, feelings, feelings of love, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is so great."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mac-cittā mad-gata-prāṇāḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
And that is being described.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bodhayantaḥ parasparam, kathayantaś ca māṁ nityaṁ tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca// [[books:bg:10:9|[Bg. 10.9]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ramanti ca,// yes. So instead of talking of Kṛṣṇa, they talk of politics, sociology, all nonsense. Simply waste of time.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mad-gata-prāṇāḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mad-gata...// One cannot talk of Kṛṣṇa unless he is //kṛṣṇa-gata-prāṇāḥ. Kṛṣṇa-gata-prāṇāḥ.// Just like your loveable objects, you cannot forget even for a moment, similarly, one who has developed real love for Kṛṣṇa, he cannot do without thinking of Kṛṣṇa, without talking of Kṛṣṇa, without acting for Kṛṣṇa. //Mad-gata-prāṇāḥ.//

**Dr. Patel:**

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te
> [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. So therefore one who has taken to this... Sometimes these Māyāvādīs rascals say that the //bhakti// is meant for the less intelligent class of men. So how he can be less intelligent? Kṛṣṇa says, //teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam.// So Kṛṣṇa personally gives you intelligence. So how He can be less intelligent?

**Chandobhai:**
He gives intelligence.

**Dr. Patel:**
That //dadami buddhi-yogam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. And what kind of //buddhi-yoga?//

**Chandobhai:**
"By which you can reach Me."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. By which he can go back to home, back to Godhead. That kind of //buddhi-yoga.//

**Dr. Patel:**
That comes later on.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not this //buddhi-yoga,// how to exploit the whole world and become Hiraṇyakaśipu.

**Dr. Patel:**

> teṣām evānukampārtham
> aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ
> nāśayāmy ātma-bhāva-stho
> jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā
> [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Teṣām.// Who are those, //teṣām?// Not all.

**Chandobhai:**
//Bhaktas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, teṣām.// It is a special favor for them. //Teṣām evānukampārtham.// So if Kṛṣṇa dissipates ignorance from the heart of a person, how he can be less intelligent? If somebody is guided by the most perfect intellect..., intellectual, then how he can be less intelligent? So these Māyāvādīs' accusation that //bhakti// is meant for the less intelligent class and //jñāna// is meant for higher class of men, so this accusation is refuted, that "No, don't think that the devotees are less intelligent, because I am guiding them."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Nāśayāmy ātma-bhāva-stho, aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ. Tamaḥ nāśayāmy ātma-bhāva-stho.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tamaḥ.// No more ignorance, darkness. So how a devotee can be in darkness, in ignorance? This is refuted.

**Dr. Patel:**
Now //arjuna uvāca.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> arjuna uvāca.
> paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma
> pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān
> puruṣaṁ śaśvataṁ divyam
> ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum
> [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So therefore, what is Kṛṣṇa is to be understood from Arjuna. This is //paramparā// system. //Paramparā// system. Arjuna talked with Kṛṣṇa personally. So his experience is first hand. So how this rascal can imagine of Kṛṣṇa that "Kṛṣṇa is like this, Kṛṣṇa is like that"? If you actually reading //Bhagavad-gītā// as Arjuna understood Kṛṣṇa, you have to accept it. This is called //paramparā.// So what is the experience of Arjuna? Arjuna said, "You are..., you are the Supreme Person, //puruṣam.// You are not female. You are not //prakṛti.// You are //puruṣa, śaśvata,// and the original, //śaśvatam,// eternally." Not that, the Māyāvādīs, "Now impersonal..." Yes, read one line. That is sufficient.

**Dr. Patel:**
That same line. //Puruṣaṁ śaśvataṁ divyam ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ādi.// Yes. //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ. Ādi-puruṣam,// He is the original person. Person. He is not imperson. //Puruṣam// is not imperson. Brahman is imperson, but Para-brahman is not imperson. So that is Kṛṣṇa. So therefore it is called //paraḥ, param.// Brahman realization. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā:// "You inquire about Brahman."

**Chandobhai:**
All-pervading, //vibhum.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vibhum,// yes, all-pervading. Just like the same example: the sun. The sun is all-pervading by sunshine, but still, sunshine is not important as the sun globe. This is to be understood. Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa... Let us understand one line. Para-brahman. Brahman, //sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.// But they are Para-brahman. //Īśvara,// everyone is //īśvara.// That's all right. But not everyone Parameṣvara.

**Chandobhai:**
//Puruṣottama.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1].

**Dr. Patel:**
Everyone is //puruṣa,// but not //puruṣottama.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. //Dhāma. Dhāma// means resting place. //Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma,// and //pavitram. Pavitra// means you are not contaminated by these material modes. //Pavitraṁ paramam,// Supreme //pavitra.// Now the question is that if Kṛṣṇa is //paraṁ pavitra...// Now sometimes they criticize that "Kṛṣṇa danced with the other girls. So how He can be contaminated?"

**Dr. Patel:**
Non-contaminated.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not contaminated. //Apāpa-vidham.// As it is said, //apāpa vidham aśnaviram.// [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Aśnaviram// means not material body. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Aśnaviram apāpa-vidham.//

**Chandobhai:**
//Kavir manīṣiḥ paribhuḥ svayambhūḥ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is being explained, yes. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
//Puruṣaṁ śaśvataṁ divyam ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Divyam. Divyam// means spiritual. //Tapo divyam. Tapo divyam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. That is the instruction of Ṛṣabhadeva: "My dear boys, you engage yourself in //tapasya.//" Now, what kind of //tapasya? Tapo divyam:// for spiritual realization. Now, materialists, there are big, big scientists, big, big archeologists and so on, so on, they are also undergoing //tapo.// Without //tapasya,// nobody can become eminent. So they are also undergoing //tapasya.// Suppose one who has manufactured this atomic bomb. This is also //tapasya.// But not this kind of //tapasya. Tapo divyam,// for understanding Kṛṣṇa. To understand Kṛṣṇa, that //tapasya// required.

**Dr. Patel:**
Shall I go further?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve
> devarṣir nāradas tathā
> asito devalo vyāsaḥ
> svayaṁ caiva bravīṣi me
> [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.13]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, people may say that "Arjuna was Kṛṣṇa's friend, so he is eulogizing Kṛṣṇa like anything." Therefore he is giving evidence that //āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarva:// "It is not my sentiment that I am accepting You as such and such. But..." [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa, //Jaya.// [break] He is giving evidence. This is required. This is required. If you say something, it must be supported by authorities. Not that my whimsically I say something like //daridra nārāyaṇa.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Again you say, //daridra-nārāyaṇa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes. Unauthorized statement. This will not be accepted. So //āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve.//

**Dr. Patel:**

> āhus tvām ṛṣayaḥ sarve
> devarṣir nāradas tathā
> asito devalo vyāsaḥ
> svayaṁ caiva bravīṣi me
> [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.13]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Vyāsa. Ultimately Vyāsa.

**Dr. Patel:**
"Even You say so." //Svayam eva.//

**Prabhupāda:**
"And You also say."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi keśava, na hi te bhagavān vyaktiṁ...// [[books:bg:10:14|[Bg. 10.14]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, this is understanding of //Bhagavad-gītā,// that "Whatever You say, I accept as truth." Not that "This portion..." Interpretation: "This portion I don't like. This portion is nice." No. Everything is nice. Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, everything is correct. That is understanding.

**Dr. Patel:**

> sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye
> yan māṁ vadasi keśava
> na hi te bhagavān vyaktiṁ
> vidur devā na dānavāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:14|[Bg. 10.14]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Vyaktim// means?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vyaktim// means His personality, personality, //vyaktim.//

**Dr. Patel:**
"Nobody knows Your personality in truth."

**Prabhupāda:**
So foolish people cannot understand what is the Personality of Kṛṣṇa. Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> svayam evātmanātmānaṁ
> vettha tvaṁ puruṣottama
> bhūta-bhāvana bhūteśa
> deva-deva jagat-pate
> [[books:bg:10:15|[Bg. 10.15]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "Therefore to understand You is to take information from You, not from others." What Kṛṣṇa says...

**Dr. Patel:**
//Svayam evātmanātmānam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because you know yourself, what you are. Nobody knows. Therefore to understand Kṛṣṇa, or God, is to accept whatever is spoken in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is real understanding.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhūta-bhāvana bhūteṣa deva-deva jagat-pate.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Vaktum arhasy aśeṣeṇa divyā hy ātma-vibhūtayaḥ// [[books:bg:10:16|[Bg. 10.16]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Deva-deva.// "There are many demigods, but You are also..."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Deva// of the //devas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. "You are the supreme of all of them, //deva-deva.// You are worshiped by the //devas.//"

**Dr. Patel:**

> vaktum arhasy aśeṣeṇa
> divyā hy ātma-vibhūtayaḥ
> yābhir vibhūtibhir lokān
> imāṁs tvaṁ vyāpya tiṣṭhasi
> [[books:bg:10:16|[Bg. 10.16]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, this is to be understood, "How You are all-pervading by Your influence, by Your power." That means "You are always there." "You" person is there. Just like a big man, big businessman, is sitting in his room, but he is all-pervading, all-pervading.

**Dr. Patel:**
But he must have got special powers deputed to certain people. And these are that //vibhūtis.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. That is //vibhūti.// That does not mean... Māyāvādī philosophy is: "Because He has spread everywhere, therefore He is imperson." He remains person, without any change, //avyaya.// But still, He is spread. That he is asking, that "How I shall understand You, that You are spread everywhere?" //Akhilātma-bhūtaḥ. Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. That is... So we have to understand from Kṛṣṇa how He is all-pervading, not that mental speculation. Just like if you take a thing and distribute all over, the original thing is lost. Not like that. Original Kṛṣṇa is there.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Pūrṇam idam// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśopaniṣad, Invocation]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> kathaṁ vidyām ahaṁ yogiṁs
> tvāṁ sadā paricintayan
> keṣu keṣu ca bhāveṣu
> cintyo 'si bhagavan mayā
> [[books:bg:10:17|[Bg. 10.17]]]

[reads next verse while Śrīla Prabhupāda talks]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. This is intelligence. How Kṛṣṇa is all-pervading, you have to learn from Kṛṣṇa and think like that. That is meditation. That is meditation, how Kṛṣṇa is all-per... Just like in the beginning also, Kṛṣṇa said, //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. So similarly, another explanation is going to be set up here.

**Dr. Patel:**
Now,

> śrī bhagavān uvāca
> hanta te kathayiṣyāmi
> divyā hy ātma-vibhūtayaḥ
> prādhānyataḥ kuru-śreṣṭha
> nāsty anto vistarasya me
> [[books:bg:10:19|[Bg. 10.19]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So "If I go on speaking, there is no end. But some of the chief principles by which I am all-pervading, I shall speak to you."

**Dr. Patel:**
And the first important:

> aham ātmā guḍākeśa
> sarva-bhūtāśaya-sthitaḥ
> aham ādiś ca madhyaṁ ca
> bhūtānām anta eva ca
> [[books:bg:10:20|[Bg. 10.20]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //ady anta,// this creation. Before this creation, Kṛṣṇa was there. Kṛṣṇa was there. When the creation is going on, it is maintained by Kṛṣṇa, and when it is dissolved, then it enters into Kṛṣṇa. //Prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Aham ātmā guḍākeśa sarva-bhūtāśaya-sthitaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
"And I am //ātmā,// Guḍākeśa. I am //ātmā.// Therefore, because My part and parcel is spreading, so that part and parcel, particle, that is the basic principle of everything." Just like this body. This body is based on that part and particle, soul. Because the soul was there, the body has developed.

**Dr. Patel:**
Otherwise body would perish. It does rot.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The body develops so long the //ātmā// is there. So similarly, because Kṛṣṇa is there, therefore whatever manifestation you see, that is due to Kṛṣṇa. Now here the latest theory of the rascals, that life has come from matter, is refuted.

**Dr. Patel:**
That is Cārvāka's theory, this Karl Marx, the Communists. That is dialectical materialism.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Now He says //aham. Aham// is living entity. So living entity is the origin of everything.

**Dr. Patel:**

> ādityānām ahaṁ viṣṇur
> jyotiṣāṁ ravir aṁśumān
> marīcir marutām asmi
> nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśī
> [[books:bg:10:21|[Bg. 10.21]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Now, this is also another nice thing, that the modern astronomers, they say that all these stars are sun. Sun. Do they not?

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes. Just like suns.

**Prabhupāda:**
But just like Kṛṣṇa says, "They are just like moon." Just see. //Nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśi.// So //śaśi// means the moon. Moon is like one of the stars. So if you say the stars are //sūrya,// then there is contradiction. How the moon and the sun can be equal? But actually, that is not. According to our Vedic astronomy, there is one sun only in one universe, although there are millions of universes. We cannot count. So there are millions of suns. That is another thing. But within the universe there is only one sun, and by the brilliance of sunshine, all these stars and moons are glittering. Just like moon shining, being reflected by the sun, similarly, all the stars they are glittering, being reflected by the sun, not that all of them are different suns. This theory is refuted.

**Dr. Patel:**

> vedānāṁ sāma-vedo 'smi
> devānām asmi vāsavaḥ
> indriyāṇāṁ manaś cāsmi
> bhūtānām asmi cetanā
> [[books:bg:10:22|[Bg. 10.22]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
The //Sāma Vedas// mean the realization of God by singing, by music. That is //Sāma Veda.//

**Dr. Patel:**
By music. "I am the soul of the music."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Therefore //hari-kīrtana. Hari-kīrtana// is //Sāma Veda,// glorifying the Supreme. That is stated in some other place.

**Dr. Patel:**
"I am Indra of the //devas.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yam brahma-varunendra-rudraḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair vedaiḥ sanga-pada-kramopa...// [SB 12.13.1]

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kramopanisadair gayanti yam samagaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Gayanti.// So //gayanti,// chanting, is following the //Sāma Veda,// and //Sāma Veda,// Kṛṣṇa says, "I am especially //Sāma Veda.//"

**Dr. Patel:**
//Devānām asmi vāsavaḥ, indriyāṇāṁ manaś cāsmi bhūtānām asmi cetanā.// "I am the..." //Cetanā// means...? Life, life and [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Life. Knowledge, knowledge.

**Dr. Patel:**

**Prabhupāda:**
//Skanda// means Kārtikeya.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes. Kārtikeya. //Maharṣīṇāṁ bhṛgur ahaṁ girām asmy ekam akṣaram// [[books:bg:10:25|[Bg. 10.25]]]. "I am //oṁ.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Yajñānāṁ japa-yajño 'smi.// [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**

**Dr. Patel:**
King. But not these kings, [Hindi].

**Prabhupāda:**
But they are not kings. They are //mlecchas.// They are not kings. //Asaṁskṛtāḥ kriyā-hīnā mlecchā rājendra-rūpinaḥ.// They have assumed the post of king, but otherwise they are //mlecchas, asaṁskṛtāḥ.// There is no //saṁskāra,// and //kriyā-hīnā,// they do not perform the Vedic rituals.

**Prabhupāda:**
The woman's voice is very attractive. Because people engage woman for singing. Their voice is natural attractive. "So that attractive voice, I am."

**Dr. Patel:**
"I am." //Kīrtiḥ śrīr vāk ca nārīṇām, smṛtir medhā// and //dhṛtiḥ// and //kṣamā.// These are the feminine qualities. "There I am. I am //kṣamā,// I am //dhṛti,// I am //medhā,// I am //smṛti// and I am the melodious sound of women. I am //kīrti// and I am //śrī.//"

**Dr. Patel:**
"I am you."

**Prabhupāda:**

**Dr. Patel:**
That means "I am you."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Munīnām apy ahaṁ vyāsaḥ kavīnām uśanā kaviḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Not "I am you." That is Māyāvāda. Dhanañjaya especially, not the rascals.

**Dr. Patel:**
"You" means He is talking with whom? Dhanañjaya.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right, Dhanañjaya. You can take, Dhanañjaya. Not that general people.

**Dr. Patel:**
But that is what He says, that "I am you." Kṛṣṇa says...

**Prabhupāda:**
Not you; Dhanañjaya. "You" means... Why you are changing the word? No, no, it is said, Dhanañjaya. You say Dhanañjaya.

**Dr. Patel:**
Pārtha, Dhanañjaya, He is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And after...

**Dr. Patel:**
But He is talking with Dhanañjaya.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. You cannot make it an impersonal. As soon as you say Dhanañjaya, He is person.

**Dr. Patel:**
Oh, yes, that way. That way you are right. //Vṛṣṇīnāṁ vāsudevo 'smi.// That means He is the father of even Himself.

Now, he is creating a trouble for Kṛṣṇa. He is creating trouble for Him.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, why trouble? Kṛṣṇa has no trouble.

**Dr. Patel:**
For himself. Arjuna is creating trouble for himself.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he is creating trouble for himself because the rascals will represent that "I am incarnation of God." Therefore Arjuna is asking Him, "Now show me Your //virāṭa-rūpa.//" So these rascals, bewildered by these so-called Gods, they should ask, "Show me your //virāṭa-rūpa.// Then I shall accept you." That is the process. Not that "I am incarnation of God." How you become incarnation? Just lift one hill. Huh? Or show me //virāṭa-rūpa.// Or show me that you have sixteen thousand wives and you are maintaining them in sixteen thousand palaces. Then you call yourself that "I am incarnation of Kṛṣṇa." Otherwise, you rascal, I cannot believe you. For them. Otherwise, Kṛṣṇa... He knows what is Kṛṣṇa, but because in future some rascal will come and will say that "I am incarnation of God," therefore it is a warning that before accepting one rascal as incarnation, you ask him to show //virāṭa-rūpa.//

**Dr. Patel:**

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So because Arjuna was not accustomed to this impersonal theory...

**Dr. Patel:**
Even the pastime, //rūpa vi...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But he wanted to see the //virāṭa-rūpa.// Therefore he said, "If you think that I shall be able to see, then You can give me."

**Dr. Patel:**
Shall I read further?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Śrī bhagavān uvāca, paśya me pārtha rūpāṇi śataśo 'tha...// [[books:bg:11:5|[Bg. 11.5]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
So it was not difficult for Him. Immediately He showed him. That is Kṛṣṇa. Not that "I shall show you some day privately."

The whole universe.

**Prabhupāda:**
So this //virāṭa-rūpa// is subordinate. //Darśayāmāsa hari. Hari// is the Supreme. And the //virāṭa-rūpa// is a feature, not that //virāṭa-rūpa// is original.

**Dr. Patel:**
One of the features of His multiple features.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. //Virāṭa-rūpa.// Not that the... Māyāvādīs take the //virāṭa-rūpa// is the origin, and this //rūpa,// Kṛṣṇa, that is //māyā.// Therefore they are called Māyāvādīs. But actually, Hari manifested or exhibited...

**Dr. Patel:**
One of his multiple...

**Prabhupāda:**
Multiple features.

Now Arjuna said. Shall I read further?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Arjuna uvāca.// These boys understand this, all of them? All of them understand?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, I will explain.

**Chandobhai:**
They can hear.

**Dr. Patel:**
Now Arjuna says, //paśyāmi devāṁs tava deva dehe sarvāṁs tathā bhūta-viśeṣa...// [[books:bg:11:15|[Bg. 11.15]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Devāṁs, devāṁs. Tava deva dehe// means "//Devas,// the demigods, they are part and parcel of Your //virāṭa-rupa.//" They are not independent. Just like this finger is part of my this whole body, similarly, all these //devas,// these demigods... That is explained previously: //ye 'py anya-devatā bhaktā yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ, te 'pi mām eva// [[books:bg:9:23|[Bg. 9.23]]]. If you give something to my finger, that is to be given to my body. But that is //avidhi-pūrvakam.// The thing's to be given to the mouth, not in the hand. But their logic is, because everything is the same, why not here? That is Māyāvāda. Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> paśyāmi devāṁs tava deva dehe

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //brahmā rāmeśvaram. Rāmeśvara// means Viṣṇu. //Rāma īśvara;// and Brahmā, Lord Brahmā, and...

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kamalāsana-stham ṛṣīṁṣ sarvān urugāṁṣ ca divyān.// All wonderful things.

He is now frightened after seeing these things.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Must be frightened. Now, suppose all of a sudden if you see a very big person, you will not be frightened? Because you are not accustomed to see that.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes. //Anādi-madhyāntam ananta-vīryam ananta-bāhuṁ śaśi-sūrya-netram paśyāmi tvāṁ dīpta-hutāśa-vaktraṁ...// [[books:bg:11:19|[Bg. 11.19]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now here is one important thing: //śaśi-sūrya-netram.// The //śaśi,// the moon, and the sun are the two eyes of God. Now in //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is also confirmed, //yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇām// [//Bs. 5.52//]. So in the //Upaniṣads// it is said, "When God sees, then you can see." So this... When the sunrise is there, that means when God sees, you can see. In the darkness you cannot see. And still, you are proud of your eyes. Yes. Without God seeing, you cannot see. And still, these rascals are proud of their eyes: "I can... Can you show me?" How you can see? First of all you have to see through the Supreme.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sva-tejasā viśvam idaṁ tapantam// [[books:bg:11:19|[Bg. 11.19]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
And another significance is that you cannot hide yourself from the seeing of the Supreme. You cannot make anything hiding. Because even in the womb there is sunshine, sunlight. So He is seeing there. Apart from being the Paramātmā, from materially also, His eyes are always there. So you cannot do anything hiding. That is not possible.

**Dr. Patel:**

Yes.

The varieties, varieties. The varieties he is seeing. That is the vision of the Vaiṣṇava. The Vaiṣṇavas also know that everything is one, but he sees the variety.

I will read again from this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] [end]
