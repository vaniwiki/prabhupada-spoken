Translation: "By rendering devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, one immediately acquires causeless knowledge and detachment from the world."

**Prabhupāda:**

> vāsudeve bhagavati
> bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ
> janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ
> jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam
> [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]

So the mission of human life is to acquire knowledge, //jñānam,// and //vairāgyam,// detachment. //Jñānam// means real identification, "What I am." In the conditioned stage of life we are passing on our days not in //jñānam// but ignorance, just like the animals. The animals, they have no //jñānam.// They are pulling on their life with the bodily concept of life. The dog is thinking, "I am dog. I am this body." He does not know whether he is dog or cat. These names we have given them. But he knows it well that "I am this body."

So this is not //jñānam.// This chance is available when we are no longer cats and dog but human being. Then we can understand that "I am not this body." This is the difference between cats and dogs and human being. The cats and dogs, they do not know that they are not the body; they are spirit soul. That they do not know. They know simply that "I am this body, and the necessities of body must be fulfilled somehow or other." That is their business. Whole day and night, they are working just to fulfill the necessities of the body, because there is no //jñānam.//

But in the human form of life, that is not the business. Therefore the //Vedānta-sūtra// says, //athāto brahma jijñāsā:// "This life, human form of life, which is achieved after evolution of 8,400,000's of forms of life..." It is called //labdhvā sudurlabham idaṁ bahu-sambhavānte// [SB 11.9.29]. //Idaṁ śarīram.// This human form of body is achieved //bahu-sambhavānte,// after achieving many, many other lower forms of life. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati// [Padma Purāṇa]. So many different forms of life we had to pass through to come to the standard of human life. Therefore this life is not meant for spoiling like cats and dogs. This is //jñānam.// The spoil the life like cats and dogs means //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna,// eating, sleeping, defending and sexual intercourse. These are the bodily demands. //Sāmānyam etat paśubhir narāṇām// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. These are common formulas for the cats and dogs and the human being. But what is the meaning of human being? The human being is eligible to understand what is the value of life, what is the problem of life, how to make the solution. That is human life. Not that simply passing our days like cats and dogs working very hard, //kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye.//

In the //śāstras// this is warned again and again. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. This human form of life is not meant for satisfying the senses, //kāmān, kaṣṭān,// with great difficulty. Now, eating is necessary, but a hog, he eats the most abominable thing, stool, but whole day and night he is searching out, "Where is stool? Where is stool? Where is stool?" So similarly, if human civilization is so made that simply for eating one has to work so hard day and night, so it is as good as the hog's life; it is not human life. Human life should be peaceful. They should get their foodstuff very easily, eat very nicely, save time for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is human life, not like hogs and dogs, simply searching after... But if we create such civilization like cats and dogs and hogs, then Kṛṣṇa will give us the chance to work day and night simply for eating, sleeping, mating and defending. That is the position now. We wanted it.

In Bombay we have got now six buildings full of tenants. So they are little disturbed because now we have taken possession of the land. They are thinking that "Swāmījī will drive me..., drive us some way or other." I told them that "I have got no children with me; neither my former family is coming to live. If I, suppose, vacate these houses, then I will fill up with my devotees. So why don't you become devotee? I don't charge anything from you." But that they are not agreeable. This is the position. Even if we offer that "You come with us, live with us peacefully, take little //prasādam// and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," they will not agree. We have got hundred branches all over the world. At least there are ten thousand men. Just as we do not work, we simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and get some //prasādam...// So there is no scarcity. There is no scarcity. //Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham// [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]].

So actually, there is no scarcity of food. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. God is so kind. //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. He is feeding many, many millions and trillions of living entities. In Africa there are millions of elephants. Who is feeding them? Kṛṣṇa is feeding them. So these economic question, overpopulation question, these are not actually problem. Problem is scarcity of God consciousness. This is the problem. Therefore we are suffering. It is not my manufactured word. It was said by my Guru Mahārāja. He said that "I don't find any scarcity in the world except the scarcity of understanding Kṛṣṇa. That's all." So this //jñānam...// This is //jñānam. Jñānam// means that "I don't belong to this material world. This my body is material, but I am different from the body." This is //jñānam.// So the necessities of my body, it must be supplied. It should not be neglected. But we should not be busy simply for the necessities of the body. We are spirit soul. The spirit soul has got its necessity. We must fill up that. Then we will be happy.

So this can be done, as it is prescribed here, that,

> vāsudeve bhagavati
> bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ
> janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ
> jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam
> [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]

The first thing, //jñānam// and //vairāgyam...// This human form of life is meant for //jñāna// and //vairāgya. Jñāna// means //vairāgya,// and //vairāgya// cannot be achieved without //jñāna.// These two are relative terms. So //jñānam// means that "I am not this body, and my relationship with my body, they are also not my necessities." This is called //jñāna.// And as soon as we understand that the simply necessities of my body are not required, that is called detachment, or //vairāgya.// Without //jñānam,// we are simply thinking that we must satisfy the senses. Body means the senses. //Indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ// [[books:bg:3:42|[Bg. 3.42]]]. So in the bodily concept of life, or in //ajñāna,// in ignorance, our business is to satisfy the senses. That is called //ajñānam, ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]], sense gratification.

This whole world is going on on the basis of sense gratification. A man and a woman, or a male or female, they develop this idea of sense gratification. Therefore as soon as a girl is grown up and a boy is grown up, the father, mother get them married, because the sense of sense gratification is very strong. Therefore the system is, Vedic system is, or any..., this human civilization system is to get them married. So //puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etam// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. So as soon as they are married, so //tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim āhuḥ,// that sense of sense gratification becomes too much tied up. //Tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim.// We have got already attraction. A man has got attraction for woman; woman has got attraction for man. Now, as soon as they are united, that attraction becomes more and more strong. //Tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim āhuḥ.// Then //ataḥ gṛha,// as soon as they are married and united, they require one apartment, //gṛha; ataḥ-gṛha-kṣetra,// then land for cultivating for producing foodstuff. //Ato gṛha-kṣetra-suta,// children; //āpta,// friends. //Ato gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittaiḥ,// and money. //Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]].

In this way the living entity becomes entangled, and his sense of //aham,// "It is my... It is..., I am this body and this property is mine," this sense increases, //moha.// It is called //moha. Moha// means actually nothing belongs to him. As soon as death will come, he has to change this body. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. He has to change the body. As soon as he changes the body, then everything is finished. His property, his wife, his children, his country, his society---everything---//mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś ca aham.// Kṛṣṇa comes as //mṛtyu.// Kṛṣṇa comes as Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Śyāmasundara, //dvi-bhuja// Muralīdhara. He comes occasionally, //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]], for the devotees. The devotees want to see Him; therefore He comes. But for the nondevotees, He also comes, but they cannot see. But Kṛṣṇa comes as death. Then they can see, "Here is Kṛṣṇa." //Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]. They're... Like Nṛsiṁha-deva. Nṛsiṁha-deva... God was challenged. Prahlāda Mahārāja was devotee. He was chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// and his father revolted: "Why you should chant Hare Kṛṣṇa? Where is Kṛṣṇa? Where is God?" This is the atheistic temperament. They'll simply defy God, or Kṛṣṇa.

So the atheistic and the theistic persons are always there. But the theistic person, they see always God. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. That is the theistic. //Santa,// those who are theistic, advanced in devotional service, they are called //santas,// saintly person, //premāñjana,// because they have developed love of Godhead. In the previous verse it has been described, //sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. That culture required. You may belong to any type of religion. It doesn't matter. You may become Hindu, Muslim, Christian, or //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya...// Whatever you may be, it doesn't matter. But if you are a religious person, the test is how much you have developed love of Godhead. Then it is tested: "Yes, you are nice." //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ.// That is the test. Otherwise it is useless. You may be Hindu, Muslim or..., whatever stamp you like, you can have it. But real test is whether you have developed love of Godhead. That is wanted.

So that requires by love of Godhead you can see God every moment. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva// [Bs. 5.38]. //Sadaiva// means twenty-four hours. People ask, "Whether you have seen God?" To see God is not difficult job. Simply you have to qualify yourself, love of Godhead. Then you can see. This is the formula. And if have not developed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, God consciousness, then also you can see God in your own way, as prescribed in the //śāstras.// Just like Kṛṣṇa says, //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the taste of the water." So you are drinking water, and as soon as you drink, if you think that "Here is the taste of water, here is Kṛṣṇa," is it very difficult? Not at all difficulty. //Prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ.// If you forget while drinking... Nobody can forget. But even intentionally you forget. So how you can check not seeing the sunshine and the moonshine? How it is possible? They say that "Have you seen God?" But why... You have seen also God, because Kṛṣṇa says, //prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:// "I am the sunshine." So who has not seen sunshine? So you have to begin seeing like that. Then if you remember Kṛṣṇa, that is also seeing. Seeing, spiritual seeing, does not mean simply to see by the eyes. Spiritual seeing means by chanting you can see, by describing you can see. Because Kṛṣṇa is Absolute. Absolute. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. In either of these item, either you hear of Kṛṣṇa, then you are seeing Kṛṣṇa. When you chant about Kṛṣṇa, then you are seeing Kṛṣṇa. When you are thinking of Kṛṣṇa, you are seeing Kṛṣṇa. This is the process. This is called //bhakti-yoga.//

Therefore it is said, //vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]. If you learn how to practice //bhakti-yoga,// and that is upon Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa... Vāsudeva... And //bhakti-yoga// therefore says, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.// Not //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam// of the politician. That will not help you. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.// If you hear about Kṛṣṇa, if you chant about Kṛṣṇa, if you think about Kṛṣṇa, if you offer worship to Kṛṣṇa, if you engage yourself with some service to Kṛṣṇa, if you offer everything for Kṛṣṇa, you'll see Kṛṣṇa always, twenty-four hours. This is the process. //Vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]. This is //bhakti-yoga.//

//Bhakti-yoga// means always be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. That is stated in the //Bhagavad... Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām.// These boys and girls who are in //bhakti-yoga,// they are //satataṁ kīrtayanto// Kṛṣṇa. They are going... Sometimes we go to make membership with these books. So we have to speak about Kṛṣṇa. //Satataṁ kīrtayantaḥ.// They are cooking for Kṛṣṇa. They are dancing for Kṛṣṇa. They are singing for Kṛṣṇa. They are talking for Kṛṣṇa. They are going round the world for Kṛṣṇa. Everything for Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness and //bhakti-yoga.// Everyone can adopt these principles. Where is the difficulty? //Vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]. In this way, if you practice //bhakti-yoga,// or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, practice Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then the result will be //janayaty āśu,// very soon.

Because big, big //jñānīs, yogīs,// they are trying to become detached from the attachment of this material world. //Yoga// system means //yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ. Yoga.// They are practicing //yama niyama āsana dhyāna dhāraṇā prāṇāyāma,// all these, //pratyāhāra.// This yogic system, mystic yogic system, what is the meaning? Meaning: detachment, not other. Nowadays it has been taken, //yoga// practice means to become healthy. But actually, //yoga// practice is not for that purpose. //Yoga// means to connect with the Supreme. That is //yoga.// So there are different types of //yoga,// but in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said,

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

The first-class //yogī,// who is? //Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā:// "Who is always thinking of Me, Hare Kṛṣṇa." Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and you always think of Kṛṣṇa. //Smaraṇam. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. This is //bhakti-yoga,// the simple practice, that if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare, tongue, your tongue is locked up and your hearing process is locked up. That is //samādhi,// immediately, absorbed in the thought of Kṛṣṇa. //Samādhi.//

//Yoga// practice means //samādhi,// comes to the //samādhi// point. This is //samādhi. Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām, samādhau na vidhīyate// [[books:bg:2:44|[Bg. 2.44]]]. But those who are too much materially attached, //bhoga aiśvarya,// material opulence... //Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām. Apahṛta,// bewildered. They are thinking by this material enjoyment, by material opulence, they will be happy. Therefore it is called //apahṛta-cetasām.// They cannot. But if you practice this //bhakti-yoga, vāsudeve...// The whole Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is //vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]. That's all. Why? Now, //jñānam// and //vairāgyam. Jñānam// means we are misidentifying, that "I am this body, and the bodily emanations, my sons, my daughters... I have got bodily relation with my wife. Therefore my wife, and the production, the sons, then grandsons, then daughter-in-law, then son-in-law..." In this way, we are clustering round. So that should be not rejected at once, but it should be taken into Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then even there is attachment, that is called //yukta-vairāgya, yukta-vairāgya.//

That is enunciated by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, that,

> anāsaktasya viṣayān
> yathārham upayuñjataḥ
> nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe
> yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate
> [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.255]

This //vairāgyam,// if I cannot... But //vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ.// Then //vairāgya// will be there. In every family you can worship Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. Where is the difficulty? Vāsudeva will not occupy a very spacious room. Here is Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. Even a small place, you can install Deity, Vāsudeva, and offer. You are eating... //Yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra.// Offer Kṛṣṇa //yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ// [[books:bg:3:13|[Bg. 3.13]]]. After all, you have to cook. Nobody, no house is there, no man is there who is not cooking. Everyone is cooking. But cook it for Kṛṣṇa, all nice //prasādam.// This is //bhakti-yoga.// Install Deity. It is not that simply in the temple the Deity should be installed. Why not at your home? Everyone can do that. Kṛṣṇa can come within your room, a small Deity, although He is //virāṭ-puruṣa. Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān.// He can become greater than the greatest and the smaller than the smallest. That is His greatness.

So everyone can //bhakti-yoga// practice, simply under the guidance of proper spiritual master who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa. From him you take lesson. And it is not difficult, this //bhakti-yoga// practice. Actually, this was the practice in India in every home. There was Deity. At least, //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,// they had Deity, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Sītā-Rāma or Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa or Nārāyaṇa //śilā.// Every house, it was being worshiped. But we have lost our culture. //Vāsudeve bhakti-yogaḥ..., bhakti-prayojitaḥ.// We have lost this culture. Revive it. Don't lose this opportunity of human life. Practice //bhakti-yoga// and be Kṛṣṇa conscious, and make your life successful. That is our mission. We are teaching. It is not a business, that "Give me some money; I will teach you." It is open. We are asking everyone, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//" What is the difficulty? There is no loss. You haven't got to pay anything. Simply as these boys have learned to chant and dance, //kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau.// This is the Gosvāmīs' teaching, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//" And why should you go to see dancing elsewhere? Dance at home. Make family organization in that way. You will be happy. Then you will understand what is your position.

This is the main mission of human life, to understand his position. Sanātana Gosvāmī, the first disciple of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he, when approached Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Benares, Vārāṇasī, Kāśī, so he was minister, prime minister of Nawab Hussain Shah, very great man. But when he met Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he decided to retire from the service and join Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So about them it is said, //tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat.// They were very big, big leaders of the //maṇḍala-pati. Maṇḍala-pati// means big, big leaders of the society, because they were ministers, all zamindars. All big, big businessmen they used to see, they used to visit, because minister's business... So he was associating with highly aristocratic families and societies, but they gave it up. //Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati..., sadā tuccha-vat. Tuccha-vat// means very insignificant. We are seeking after aristocratic society's association, to become big man, but these Gosvāmīs, although they were ministers, they decided, //tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati sadā tuccha-vat.// Then what did they become? //Bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna-kanthāśritau:// "For the benefit of the whole human society, they took the mendicant's dress." Just like in our political movement, Mahatma Gandhi also took the mendicant's dress, loincloth, these Gosvāmīs also. That is Indian culture.

So in a renounced... That is //vairāgya, vairāgya.// Political //vairāgya// is different. The political //vairāgya// is that "I don't want things, anything, anything for me, but for my son, for my grandson, for my countrymen, for my this, that." Not like that. This //vairāgya// means //vāsudeve:// "I don't want anything personally for me, but I want everything for Vāsudeva." This is the difference between political mendicant and the spiritual mendicant. So these Gosvāmīs were spiritual mendicant, //vairāgya.// That //vairāgya... Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā. Dīna. Dīna// means this poor mass of people. They are very poor. Because they have no knowledge what is the aim of life, therefore poor in knowledge. Poor means one who is poor in knowledge. Material poverty, that is no consideration. That is coming and going. //Tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]. That has been advised, that if you are little... Nobody is actually happy, even if you have got enough money. But still, there is unhappiness. But that they cannot understand. But actually, poverty is want of knowledge. Therefore the acquiring knowledge, that is real richness. That is real richness. That is called //brāhmaṇa. Brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.// Therefore //brāhmaṇa// is respected by even the king. That was the system in India. Because they were rich in knowledge.

So richness of knowledge is required, //jñānam,// and //vairāgya. Vairāgya// required, because we have been entangled in this materialistic way of life. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. Another life, another body. I do not know what kind of body. Then another chapter. In this way our life is going on. Therefore we must have detachment from this materialistic way of life, changing one body to... But people are so ignorant, they do not take it very seriously. They think, "Let us go on. Eh, we don't mind. Whatever happens, happens." That is not required. You must have knowledge. This knowledge is imparted from the very beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā. Aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase// [[books:bg:2:11|[Bg. 2.11]]]. People are talking very, very big, big talks, but all around this body. All around this body. //Aśocyān. Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.// About this body nobody is very serious if he is a //paṇḍita.// If he is a fool, rascal, then he is simply involved in the bodily problems. So that is called //jñāna.//

But this //jñāna// can be achieved very easily. How? How it is easily? That is also said in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānām...// Ah, no...

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te
> [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]

If you engage yourself in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, then Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is within you. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. He is already there. Not that you have to find out Vāsudeva from anywhere. Vāsudeva is everywhere. He is also within. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. Vāsudeva is within this universe, within your heart, or even within the atom. So Vāsudeva is every... Simply you have to find out. So how you can find out? //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. As soon as you engage yourself in the service of Vāsudeva with love and faith---that is being taught in Kṛṣṇa consciousness: with love and faith---then Vāsudeva is already there. He knows what you are. You cannot cheat Him. When He understands that now you are serious about knowing, He says, //dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam:// "I supply //buddhi-yoga.//" //Buddhi-yoga,// that is //yoga.// The //yoga, buddhi-yoga,// means //bhakti-yoga.// Because it is said, //dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te.// This //buddhi-yoga// means "by which one can approach Me." And it is clearly explained in another..., Eighteenth Chapter, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. Therefore //buddhi-yoga// means //bhakti,// or //bhakti-yoga.// Because without //bhakti,// you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. And here Kṛṣṇa says, "I give him //buddhi-yoga,// intelligence, 'My dear devotee, you kindly do this. You will come to Me.' "

So you do not require... As soon as... Therefore it is called //ahaitukī.// A devotee is understanding everything without any cause. How it is? Because the Vāsudeva is giving intelligence. //Teṣām evānukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ, nāśayāmi// [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]]. So a devotee, sincere devotee, do not think that he is not in knowledge. He is perfect in knowledge because the knowledge is being imparted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead from within. //Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. As He did. He gave intelligence to Lord Brahmā how to create this universe. Similarly, He will give intelligence to you also if you become sincere in serving Vāsudeva. This is explained. //Vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ, janayaty āśu// [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]. And as soon as you are getting knowledge, naturally you will be reluctant to this material sense enjoyment. Material world means sense enjoyment, and spiritual world means not sense enjoyment for personal sense enjoyment, but enjoyment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the... We have to learn, one after another, what is difference between material and spiritual. That is explained in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// very nicely in two lines, //ātmendriya-tṛpti-vāñchā tāre bali kāma// [[books:cc:adi:4:165|[Cc. Ādi 4.165]]]. Lusty desires, or //kāma,// materialism, what is that? Now, //ātmendriya-tṛpti-vāñchā,// when one wants to fulfill his own desires of the own senses, that is called //kāma.// And //kṛṣṇendriya-tṛpti vāñchā dhare prema nāma.// The same thing, when you want to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, then you become devotee.

You see the behavior of Arjuna. He wanted to satisfy in the beginning his own senses. "My dear Kṛṣṇa, if I kill my grandfather, my teacher Droṇācārya, my grandfather... No, no, it is impossible. I cannot do that. My brothers are..." That means he wanted to satisfy his senses. But when Kṛṣṇa instructed him //Bhagavad-gītā,// He inquired from Arjuna, "Now what is your decision?" //Yathecchasi tathā kuru// [[books:bg:18:63|[Bg. 18.63]]]. Then he said that //naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtir labdhā tvat-prasādena:// "By Your grace, now my all illusion is over. I have got my original Kṛṣṇa consciousness." What is that? "My business is to satisfy You, not my senses." Then he became devotee. This is the... //Vāsudeve bhagavati.// If you engage yourself in the service, regulative principles... In the beginning you must follow the regulative principles. Then spontaneous love, then you will get.

So these things should be arising.

> nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti sādhya' kabhu naya
> śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:107|[Cc. Madhya 22.107]]]

This is already there in you; simply you have to awaken it. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness is already there in everybody. It is not that it is an artificial thing. Love for God is there already, because we are part and parcel of Him. But it is now covered, covered by material association. //Acchedita.// Just like the mirror is covered by dust, you cannot see, but you polish it, you will see your face; similarly, this //bhakti-yoga// process is polishing the mirror of your heart, and when it is nicely polished, you will see what is your position, what you are, what is your business, how you shall be happy. Everything will come out.

Therefore our request is that you take this Kṛṣṇa conscious movement, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, very serious and try to apply yourself in the service of Vāsudeva. The very simple thing. If you cannot do anything, you follow the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. As Kṛṣṇa says, //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya.// You are drinking water. While drinking water, as soon as you taste the sweet taste, you simply remember, "This is Kṛṣṇa." Is it very difficult task? Not at all. Simply you have to agree. //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. And as soon as in the morning you see the sunshine, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa." As soon as in the evening you see the moonshine, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa." And what to speak of when the Vedic reciters, //brāhmaṇas,// are chanting, //oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padam...,// in the morning, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa. Here is //oṁkāra.//" In this way you simply think of Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and your life will be successful.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
