**Prabhupāda:**
...drawing the attention of the papers. And now so many papers, they have published his statement. There are four, five, ten [indistinct], but about our... What is his name?

**Devotee (1):**
Lieberman.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Lieberman is his original name.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Amarendra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Amarendra.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes, he said he's dominating the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah?

**Satsvarūpa:**
He's dominating the public attention.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is very success. [break] ...that he's dominating?

**Satsvarūpa:**
That's what he wrote in his letter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Satsvarūpa:**
He thinks that he's going to win. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that these rascal leaders, they cannot give us any comfort. All over the world. Here in Gujarat, the students have insulted the leader, you know? Ah, so horribly. They have dragged the prime minister, chief minister, dragged him and set up and put him seated on a ass's back. In this way he was insulted.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Prime minister.

**Prabhupāda:**
The chief minister.

**Mahāṁśa:**
The chief minister.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee:**
This was in Jerusalem?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah? No, no. Gujarat, here.

**Devotee:**
Gujarat.

**Prabhupāda:**
The next province. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...speaking all the words that he has learned from me. Very good. Very nicely he's presenting.

**Mahāṁśa:**
He's an elderly gentleman?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, only twenty-five. [break] ...they have got the all these culprits, the burglars, the thieves, they should be punished exemplary. [chuckles] Due to his effort. Yes, that should be done. [break] One telegram: "Come immediately Bombay. Everything will be all right. Kṛṣṇa will blessed you." [break] I mean to say intelligent in their part, they'll at least give a chance to him. Yes. [break] ...doing all right.

**Satsvarūpa:**
He said he didn't feel well. He was not going to take the walk.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Satsvarūpa:**
He said he felt too...

**Prabhupāda:**
He has come.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
That he thinks always, not to take walk. But when he takes, that is good. [break] //...dharma,// what is //dharma,// religion.

**Mahāṁśa:**
I was not there yesterday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you were not there. So what arrangement is made now?

**Mahāṁśa:**
I got all the bus tickets for the devotees...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Mahāṁśa:**
...and for the plane tickets there was a little difficulty. I don't know how many plane tickets are available yet, but I definitely got minimum two. I don't know if I'll be able to get four, but I'm trying. I'm first on the waiting list, so I hope we can get four tickets. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...how nice program.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes, I told him to send a telegram in any case, but he has not sent. But if the..., if the program was not nice, then he would have definitely sent some message to cancel the program. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...get help from them by his bogus program.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Vishva Hindu Parishad. What is this nonsense Vishva Hindu...? [chuckles] He does not know what is the meaning of Hindu. And his //jñāna-yajña. Gītā jñāna yajña.// He does not understand even a word of //Gītā,// and this rascal is preaching //Bhagavad-gītā.// This is going on. And he has made some name, people after him. People means if you flatter him, that "Whatever you are doing, it is all right."

**Mahāṁśa:**
They will...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then they will be very much pleased. And as soon as you criticize, that "You are doing this wrong. You will suffer," "Oh, yes, this Swāmījī is not... Conservative." That is going on everywhere. In the name of religion you do all nonsense rascaldom, and if the leader approves, "Yes, you can do." Vivekananda did it. Vivekananda did it. "Yes, there is no difference between eating meat and not meating eat in terms of religious system." He preached this, and all the //sannyāsīs// of Ramakrishna Mission, they eat meat, they drink, they have woman secretary, and everything. This Chinmayananda also like that. I know his whole history. Unless one is purely Kṛṣṇa conscious, one cannot give up all these bad habits. This is the test. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca// [SB 11.2.42]. One... Unless one is substantially advanced in //kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// they cannot give up this material attachment---illicit sex, meat-eating. They cannot. It is impossible. So even in the name of //svāmī// and big, big //yogīs...// They are doing all these things. Especially those who go in foreign countries. And in USA illicit sex is very cheap. Everything is very cheap. Yes. Intoxication very cheap, meat-eating very cheap, gambling very cheap. So when they get this cheap amenities, they forget their so-called spiritual life.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Akṣayānanda:**
One of our friends went and heard Chinmayananda, and he came back to the temple and he said, "Oh, he was speaking very nicely."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Akṣayānanda:**
So Mahāṁśa Swami said, "What did he say?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Akṣayānanda:**
"I do not know." [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is he?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Hariprasad's sons. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Rai Krishan[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the disease.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes.

**Mahāṁśa:**
They just speak very big words so that the language looks very nice, but people don't understand a word what they are saying.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Prabhupāda talks meaningless words, imitating the rascals; devotees laugh] They go on speaking like this. And people, "Oh, how amazing!" You simply give some grammatical form and talk all nonsense, people will appreciate it. Jugglery. This is called jugglery. The Māyāvādī //paṇḍitas// also do that. All the Māyāvādīs are against me, because I am talking about //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, and they screw their own meaning by jugglery of words. So they are all enemies. The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs, smārta-paṇḍitas,// all of them. [break] ...ananda has constructed a //śiva-liṅga// temple.

**Mahāṁśa:**
//Śiva-liṅga.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śiva-liṅga.// You have seen //śiva-liṅga?//

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
A temple of... There are so many hundreds and thousands of Śiva temples, but nobody has exhibited //śiva-liṅga,// big //śiva-liṅga// on the head of the temple.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Where is that, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
It is in Bombay. And he's speaking on //Gītār Gān. Gītār Gān// means to construct a big //śiva-liṅga// temple. He's proving himself a rascal by his activities. He is a rascal number one. He has gone many times foreign countries, but not a single foreign student he has got. [break] ...from atheistic fools who are not prepared to follow any rules and regulation, they are after him. Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
That Sai Baba too...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everyone.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Many of those young boys and girls, they are potential devotees. They are just in it for a bit of fun. A bit of fashion or fun.

**Prabhupāda:**
Similarly Rajneesh. [break] ...very good intelligence, Lieberman.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, he's speaking very nicely. He's fit for that position. Similarly our..., what is his name?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Balavanta.

**Prabhupāda:**
Balavanta. He is also very nice. [break] If we get some important votes in the government, then our mission will be successful. This our philosophy is being properly ventilated. It is coming in the papers, you see. On account of this political leadership. And I see that his statements are published profusely. Not with other contemporaries. And what they'll speak? They have no sense, they have no leadership idea.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Some devotees express a fear that after some time all these bogus groups, they will start running political men, too, and then the field may be ruined, that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Soon, they say, especially the boy //yogī,// he always follows whatever we do. When we go out and distribute books, they do; when we have //kīrtana,// they do. So there's the fear that soon they'll all be running for office, all these bogus men, because we are doing.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they cannot say anything.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have... This, the followers of the Bala Yogi, they're simply rascals.

**Devotee:**
They'll just be more exposed... They'll have to study your books to find out what to say.

**Prabhupāda:**
They cannot even speak... Ah?

**Devotee:**
They'll have to study your books to find out what to say.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Just like our..., what is this? Sai, Sai, Siddhasvarūpa. He also tried to imitate ourself, and by reading, reading, he became my disciple. That's all. Although he has the same mentality still, still he does not find any better solution than in our philosophy. The Karandhara, he went away [chuckles] and does not find any solution. You see?

**Satsvarūpa:**
"I find no alternative to Kṛṣṇa's service," he said.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is the final. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. That is final. [break]

**Mahāṁśa:**
...would start all over the world?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Mahāṁśa:**
We should endeavor?

**Prabhupāda:**
If we'll be successful in America, then all over, everywhere it will be followed. [break] So give him some instruction.

**Mahāṁśa:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Today one very big minister is going to come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Mahāṁśa:**
He was a minister. His name is Channa Reddy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Mahāṁśa:**
He used to be running for the chief ministership. He's very, very popular, but there was some mischief he did, for which he was taken to court and exposed.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that mischief he did?

**Mahāṁśa:**
I don't remember exactly, but he was taken to court and exposed, and he was expelled from entering into any...

**Prabhupāda:**
Party.

**Mahāṁśa:**
...any elections for five years. So now his period is finishing, his five years is finishing, and he is going to stand again, and it seems that he's very, very popular, he has a good chance. And he's our Life Member...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, he's our Life Member?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He studies our books?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Oh, yes, he has taken our books, and he especially asked that "I am reading these books and please give me." And he attended all the three days of the Exhibition Grounds.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Mahāṁśa:**
[aside:] You maybe remember, no?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Channa Reddy. He's very nice. He'll be coming today at ten o'clock. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...defect of the modern politicians. Here at the present moment, their philosophy is that one must be very cunning diplomat, then he's successful politician. This is their philosophy. The most crooked man, like Cāṇakya. But our philosophy is that the political head should be like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Lord Rāmacandra. That is difference. Here Churchill or Hitler or similar man, crooked man... Without being crooked one cannot become politician. Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, he said that "Consistency in politics is the qualification of an ass." Consistency. You must change. [break]

**Mahāṁśa:**
...you should never trust a politician. So if you cannot trust a politician, why we elect him as a leader? Why should he be a leader?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, "Do not trust" means you are also not trustworthy. Nobody trusts you, and you should also not. That is their philosophy. All these big, big politicians... Just like United Nation. The same philosophy is going on. Nobody trusts anyone, but they speak big, big. [break] [pause]

**Akṣayānanda:**
Did he mean because the politicians will degrade... [break] [end]
