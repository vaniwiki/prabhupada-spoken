**Prabhupāda:**
Actually, if we become successful then all these things will be finished.

**French devotee:**
Finished.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] Huh?

**French devotee:**
They are attracted by wonderful things such as Sai Baba. He is doing so many wonderful things. People...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is, means rascal. He does not see Kṛṣṇa's wonderful. If you want to see wonderful things, why don't you see the more wonderful things? But they are foolish; they are captivated with small wonderful things. That means less intelligent. Just like small children, they will be amazed by seeing small wonderful things, but his father will not be. What is the amazement, wonderful thing, Sai Baba has done? If he is creator of gold, then why he is doing business of incense? You know that? He has a big incense business exactly like us. He can create gold? Why there is incense business? [break]

Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to give to His mother some gold when there was need of money. "Mother, I got this gold. So you can utilize it." The mother would think that "We are poor men. We have no gold. Wherefrom this boy brings gold?" So he [she] was doubtful because he [she] was thinking, "My son is mad, sometimes crazy." So he [she] would go, "Is it real gold? Just see." Then, "Yes, it is real gold." "Hmm, how He got it?" You see? [break] ...many //yogīs,// they make such gold for meeting their expenditure. Yes. Still in India they know how to make gold from copper. Yes. The process is they will drink mercury at night, and in the morning they will urine on the copper coins. And then after some hours, the copper coins taken and put into the fire, it becomes gold. And it is scientific that some molecules of mercury, if mixed with copper, it is gold. Gold is combination of mercury and copper. But the people cannot mix it. They have tried. That is called alchemist. They tried to mix it. Because they do not know the process, as soon as mercury is put into the fire, it immediately goes out. You melt copper, and in hot copper, if you put mercury, it will not melt together. Immediately it will throw away. So some of the //yogīs,// they know. They digest copper, er, mercury, and it comes in the form urine. And then the copper is put there. There is interaction, and then put into fire. It becomes gold.

**Gargamuni:**
So we should start manufacturing.

**Prabhupāda:**
You first of all eat mercury then. [laughter] You'll be finished. [laughs] [break] ...no scarcity. Why should we go to imitate the rascals? We have got enough gold. Kṛṣṇa is supplying gold whenever we require. [break] //...artha-prayojanam.// Whatever you need, Kṛṣṇa will supply you, if you actually remain dependent on Kṛṣṇa. There are so many literatures of different groups, but who is selling so much---forty thousand, fifty thousand daily---unless Kṛṣṇa is helping us? In the history, no religion book have sold thirty thousand, forty thousand daily. There is no history. So why don't you see this wonderful thing? All the money that I have brought from USA, India, it is all Book Fund. Nobody has given. George has given. That is not in cash. And he gave that two //lakhs.// That was spent for //Kṛṣṇa// book. So wherefrom the cash is coming?

**Gargamuni:**
Sales of books. That is...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Because we have got substantial sale of books, we are free to get money. And it is unbelievable that religious books are sold thirty thousand, forty thousand, fifty thousand daily. There is no history.

**Gargamuni:**
So that is a miracle.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is it not miracle?

**Satsvarūpa:**
How one person can sell a hundred //Bhāgavatams.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Some of those devotees like Tripurāri, a hundred big //Bhāgavatams.// It's not a popular book.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not popular actually. For the common man it is dry subject. And I have heard that after reading one book, somebody comes to purchase. "What is this, //Bhāgavata?//" "We have got six." "All right, give me six volumes." He is not a devotee. Why he purchases all the six volumes of //Bhāgavatam?// In London our //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// was sold in two months, thirty thousand copies. That is reports. Thirty thousand copies.

**Yadubara:**
Even though they don't understand the subject matter, they purchase.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. [break] Bon Mahārāja has written part of //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.// And he published it before my coming to foreign countries.

**Gargamuni:**
Yes. He has not sold any.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he has sold some, but still lying in the store. He published only one thousand copies. Our //Nectar of Devotion,// the translation of the same book, is selling like hotcakes. Yes. In the university, Temple University, they have made a textbook. And everywhere they like it, //Nectar of Devotion.// I think... What is our edition at the present moment? Fourth or fifth edition. And we don't publish less than ten thousand copies. So we have to depend on Kṛṣṇa sincerely. Serve Him, everything, what is required, that will come, some way or other. That is miracle. Why should we try to cheat others, that "I can manufacture gold"? This rascal, if he can manufacture gold, then why he is doing incense business? That is simply jugglery. Even the magicians, they can do. They create so much money. But he is a poor man. Why he remains poor? And everyone thinks of us that we have got unlimited wealth. You know that?

**Gargamuni:**
Yes. In Māyāpur, when I bring over the //karatālas,// they are very heavy, two hundred sets of //karatālas.// So the boatmen say, "//Sona, sona.//" They are thinking it is gold, the //karatālas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone. Even government. In the Parliament the question was raised, "Wherefrom they get money fabulously?" These men in our country, they may be fools. In your country also, Los Angeles, I mean, neighboring storekeepers, they are wonderful, that "These people do not work and they have got so many cars and live so nicely?" [laughing] They inquire that "How do you get all these things?" They actually see that they are not ordinary working. They have no working or bank balance or business. Still, they have got so many cars and they eat nicely and they maintain such a nice house. And six, seven house they have purchasing. The realtors, they also know in America that we are very rich men. As soon as there is some property, they offer, because they know that we are very rich men. Because we have purchased some properties, so all the realtors, they have taken it for granted that we have got immense money. Here also, the members are thinking like that...

**Mahāṁsa:**
Yes, in Hyderabad.

**Prabhupāda:**
...that "Swāmījī has got immense money."

**Mahāṁsa:**
Yes. And he will send men we want.

**Prabhupāda:**
He will pay. You can tell them that "Not a single farthing here. He can spend elsewhere. If you don't pay for the temple, then we shall go on like this. But as he has promised one //lakh// of rupees, that we will pay. That's all." Others, you have to collect here. That one //lakh// is promised. That we will pay.

**Mahāṁsa:**
Otherwise we can go on like this. This is very nice. So many people are coming...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. In Bombay also, we can go without Deity or... Things are going on. There is no hindrance. Our members are coming. They are becoming members. You see? There is no difficulty. [break] You know the parliamentary question?

**Gargamuni:**
Yes.

**Mahāṁsa:**
What was that?

**Gargamuni:**
The Parliament.

**Prabhupāda:**
Parliament questioned that "These Americans, they are supposed to be..." What is that? CIA. "CIA. Is there any information to the government? Besides that, they have got fabulous money, they are spending. Wherefrom they get the money? And if they are CIA, then what steps the government is going to step..., take against them?" So the reply was three. First reply was, "The government has no information that they are CIA people. Therefore the third question doesn't require to be answered, what steps. And so far their fabulous money, it is understood they collect by selling their literature and public contribution." Yes. Home Member replied like this.

**Mahāṁsa:**
This was in the papers also?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. [break] Mirzapur, near Allahabad?

**Gargamuni:**
Yes, in U.P.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, when I was businessman.

**Gargamuni:**
Some man has invited us there for //kīrtana// program. He wants to donate some building there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's nice. We get a nice place, on the Ganges side. If he donates, it will be very sanitary place.

**Gargamuni:**
He wants to invite us in October.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mirzapur is rich people. They have got carpet industry. Mirzapur carpet is very famous. They manufacture and sell big, nice carpets. Just like Persian carpets, so similarly, Mirzapur carpet. Besides that, they have got many other businesses. So it is on the Ganges side, and the healthy quarter also. [break] ...still, he is the biggest practitioner in Allahabad. He has offered his house. In old days he constructed it for four //lakhs.//

**Tejiyas:**
Allahabad is an important place?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Allahabad, very important.

**Gargamuni:**
Many people go...

**Prabhupāda:**
The U.P. high court is there. Therefore all enlightened... University is there. All educated men of U.P. are in Allahabad. These Jawaharlal Nehru, Motilal Nehru, they were Allahabad men. Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, big, big, well-known men, they are all... Pandit Madana Mohana Mahalabdha. All big, big politicians, they were Allahabad men. [break] ...times to print the books here. No action was taken. In the last five years everyone tried, and there was no result. Otherwise we can print all the books here.

**Gargamuni:**
No, but the quality is better.

**Prabhupāda:**
Quality is better, but it will be cheaper. It doesn't matter. But to get books there, it takes so much time, and the book department is not being managed nicely. But if we print here, the all problems will be solved. Here that gentleman, he has got press. Why not let him print?

**Gargamuni:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Why don't you call him immediately if he can print? We can reprint all the books here.

**Mahāṁsa:**
But the quality will not be half as good.

**Gargamuni:**
There is now a paper shortage in India, very acute.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, we can get paper from foreign countries. That will be not difficult.

**Mahāṁsa:**
Oh. If we can get paper from foreign countries, then the printing results can be very good. Because the printing is not bad. It's the paper which is very bad.

**Tejiyas:**
Still, at the same time, everybody buys Gita Press books. Even though the quality is bad, everyone is buying.

**Prabhupāda:**
The quality is third class.

**Tejiyas:**
Everyone is buying all over India, Gita Press.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they supply cheap.

**Gargamuni:**
Well, it's in Hindi also. We have to print in Hindi. They won't print in English.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, first of all supply the English then. We... [break] ...tried to sell her press for fifty //lakhs// of rupees. She thinks that I am so rich man.

**Mahāṁsa:**
Which press?

**Gargamuni:**
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan?

**Prabhupāda:**
Associated Press, something like that. Bombay's first-class press. [break] ...they are not coming to us. [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...but they would rather be nondevotees than work all day. They can stay there free.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I offered that. "What is this 2,000, 2,500 per month? Oh, we can earn at any moment 2,000. So you become devotee; I excuse you of rent." They are not agreeing. [break] ...like an ass, simply for sense gratification. Therefore it is warned in the //Bhāgavatam, nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kāṣṭān kāmān arhati// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]].

[break] ...to respect the Vaiṣṇava, to water //tulasī// and this //aśvattha// tree. These are //bhakti// items. [break]

**Nitāi:**
//Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
