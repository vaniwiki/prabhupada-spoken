**Prabhupāda:**
Everything is perverted reflection. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]: "Everything is born from the Absolute Truth." So unless there is something in the Absolute Truth, how it can be reflected here? Everything is there.

**Dr. Patel:**
Almost everything. All His //śaktis// excepting Him.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Athāto brahma jijñāsā. Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]].

**Girirāja:**
[reading from //Kṛṣṇa// book] "They began to say that 'The chief //gopī,// Rādhārāṇī, who was taken alone by Kṛṣṇa, must be very proud of Her position, thinking Herself the greatest of the //gopīs.// Yet how could Kṛṣṇa take Her alone, leaving all of us aside?' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...song by Rūpa Gosvāmī, //rādhe jaya jaya mādhava-dayite.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Rādhe jaya jaya mādhava...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mādhava-dayite, gokula...// Eh?

**Girirāja:**
//Taruṇī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Gokula-taruṇī maṇḍala-mahite. Rādhe jaya jaya mādhava-dayite, gokula-taruṇī,// all the //maṇḍala-mahite.// She is the most beautiful amongst all the young girls in Gokula. //Rādhe jaya jaya mādhava...// Rūpa Gosvāmī's praying,

> rādhe jaya jaya mādhava-dayite
> gokula-taruṇī maṇḍala-mahite

And Jīva Gosvāmī says, //rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktir asmād ekātmānāv api, deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. //Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa...// Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself by His pleasure potency. That is Rādhārāṇī. //Ekātmānāv api deha-bhedaṁ gatau.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Even though They are one in... Separate in body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. //Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktiḥ.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Hlādinī-śaktiḥ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. So Rādhārāṇī is the //hlādinī-śakti.// So when the Para-brahman wants to enjoy, He does not enjoy in this, the material energy. He expands His own pleasure potency. That is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //tattva. Tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptam caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. "They have again become united in the form of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu." //Rādhā kṛṣṇa nāhe anya. Śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya, rādhā kṛṣṇa nāhe anya. Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktir asmād ekātmānāv api deha...// [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...same thing in every respect. We imitate, "I am the lord of everything." That is also imitation.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes, that is also imitation. We are imitating //gopīs,// not Kṛṣṇa. [Hindi] Ah, his representative, he will put on him. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Girirāja, who is the Girirāja?

**Girirāja:**
Govardhana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
You are also Govardhana, enlarger of the cows.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Govardhana-pādapa-tale.// This is the... This is the //bhajana// of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava. //He rādhe vraja-devike ca lalite he nanda-sūno kutaḥ. Kutaḥ:// "Where you are?" Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava will never say that "We have seen." //Kutaḥ:// "Where you are?"

> he rādhe vraja-devike ca lalite he nanda-sūno kutaḥ
> śrī-govardhana-[kalpa-]pādapa-tale kālindī-vane kutaḥ

Or //govardhana-pādapa-tale.//

> ghoṣantāv iti sarvato vraja-pure khedair mahā-vihvalau
> vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau
> [Ṣaḍ-gosvāmy-aṣṭaka 8]

> ei chay gosāi jār, tār mui dās,
> tān-sabāra pada-reṇu, mora pañca-grās
> [Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura]

We have to follow the Gosvāmīs to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //tattva.// Directly we cannot understand.

> rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti,
> kabe hāma bhujhabo, se jugala-pīriti

"The conjugal love between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, when I shall understand?" //Rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti:// "When I shall be very much eager to the favor of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Raghunātha Gosvāmī, it may be possible I can understand what is Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa." This is the process. So Rūpa Gosvāmī and other Gosvāmīs, they never said that "In Vṛndāvana we have seen Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa."

**Dr. Patel:**
They were searching, search of Rādhā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Search of Rādhā. That is Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava, //vipralambha,// in separation, feeling, "Where is Kṛṣṇa? Where is Kṛṣṇa? Where is Kṛṣṇa?" //Govinda-viraheṇa me. Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.//

**Dr. Patel:**
"The whole world is //śūnya// in absence of..."

**Prabhupāda:**
This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. //Govinda-vira...//

> yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa
> cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam
> śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ
> govinda-viraheṇa me
> [[books:cc:madhya:20:39|[Cc. Antya 20.39, Śikṣāṣṭaka 7]]]

This is the summit of //bhajana,// when one will be crying and there will be tears, torrently, and one will see everything as vacant for being separated from Govinda. That is the topmost summit of //kṛṣṇa-bhajana.//

Hare Kṛṣṇa. Go on. Parīkṣit Mahārāja said, when he was sitting on the bank of the Ganges, prepared for meeting death within seven days, all the great personalities, sages, saints, kings, they came to see him. So he said that "My dear //brāhmaṇas,// here is Ganges, and you are also present here. So take me as your surrendered soul. I am surrendered to you. So at the present moment let that //takṣaka,// the snake-bird, or anything may come and bite. I don't care for it. Please go on with the //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// Go on with your //kṛṣṇa-kathā.//" Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Then came Śukadeva. That is the point Śukadeva comes.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Śukadeva later on came.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes, after that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So we should be always engaged in //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// Oh, danger is always there. This is a place...

**Dr. Patel:**
You must act like Parīkṣit.

**Prabhupāda:**
You don't care for danger. You go on chanting. That's all. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām// [SB 10.14.58]. This is a place where //padaṁ padaṁ vipadām:// every step there is danger. How much dangerous position you'll save? Better go on chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all.

**Passerby:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa!

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...and some European..., one European was coming. So as soon as we face to face, so I had to get down. They forced me.

**Dr. Patel:**
You know that way they behaved with Gandhijī in South Africa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Beaten him like anything. He would have died. [break] Fisher's, Fisherman's island. "I shall again turn them into fisherman's island."

**Dr. Patel:**
If you are citizen you may [indistinct] non violence.

**Prabhupāda:**
Germany is the bitterest enemy of Britain.

**Dr. Patel:**
Stalin.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Germany, whole Germany.

**Dr. Patel:**
Hitler.

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not like to speak in English also. Yes, I have seen it. Even they know English, they'll not speak. In the bank they could speak a little, little English, but they avoid. Then I took... What is that boy that first went to...?

**Bhāgavata:**
Śivānanda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Śivānanda. Then I... Śivānanda talked in Germany.

**Dr. Patel:**
It is a hate. Hating. They [indistinct], I mean Germany, the First World War, and we had very bad... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...two wars is due to Germany's hatred to Britain. That's all. There was always competition in colonization between France, Holland...

**Dr. Patel:**
Germany. All of them.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not Germany. Not Germany. Germany never tried for colonization.

**Dr. Patel:**
Belgium, such a small thing, they have half of the Central Africa like a pyramid standing on its tip. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Britishers were maintaining the British Empire at the cost of India. Soldiers, money...

**Dr. Patel:**
Indian Army was Indian Civil totally. Even today it is so. Indian Army fought very... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Pathans, Sikhs, they fought so nicely.

**Dr. Patel:**
This Mount Hazeno[?] battle, which I read very... [laughter] They... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Girirāja:**
"Śukadeva Gosvāmī has used the word //śraddhānvita// for one who is trained in the spiritual life. //Śraddhā,// or faith, is the beginning. One who has developed his faith in Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme spirit soul, can both describe and hear." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Devotee:**
They're in the hospital.

**Bhāgavata:**
Caraṇāravinda was in the hospital.

**Prabhupāda:**
So who is take care him?

**Bhāgavata:**
Mahādeva. [break] ...authorities.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Anu. Anu// means "follow." //Anuśṛṇuyat. Śṛṇu. Śṛṇu// means "hear." //Krīditaṁ ca idaṁ ca vikrīdita vraja-vadhūbhiḥ, viṣṇoḥ anuśṛṇuyāt.// Don't directly read. Don't directly. //Anuśṛṇuyāt:// "Hear from the authoritative person."

**Girirāja:**
"One must hear from disciplic succession. //Anu// means following, and //anu// means always. So one must always follow the disciplic succession and not hear from any stray professional reciters." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
There is on //rāga// stage. One must have passed the //sādhana// stage...

**Dr. Patel:**
That is neophyte.

**Prabhupāda:**
...neophyte stage and, means, regulative principles.

**Girirāja:**
"Those who are simply attracted to temple worship but do not know the philosophy of //bhakti// are in the neophyte stage." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...still India's spiritual culture, that people were not trained up in the //bhakti// science; simply they go to the temple, [makes sound of bell-ringing] "//dung, dung, dung.//" That's all. That has finished.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhakti// is practiced more in south.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dr. Patel:**
In the south there is...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, everywhere. Everywhere. They do not know. In the temple there is no discussion scientifically about Kṛṣṇa or anything. You see? [Hindi]

> yaḥ pūjāṁ śraddhāyehate
> na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu
> sa bhaktaḥ prakṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ

//Prakṛtaḥ.// They are on the material platform; they're not on the spiritual platform. But this //rāsa-līlā// hearing is meant for persons who are actually on the spiritual platform. But they hear from the material platform; therefore...

**Dr. Patel:**
They become lusty.

**Bhāgavata:**
//Bhāgavata-saptāhas. Bhāgavata-saptāhas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, //bhāgavata-saptāha.// It is all nonsense. Simply they are hearing from the material platform some //karma-kāṇḍīya vicāra,// that "If you hear..."

**Dr. Patel:**
Krishna Shankar Shastri is speaking very...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Dr. Patel:**
Krishna Shankar Shastri from Nariya[?] [indistinct] place.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's a learned scholar, I know.

**Dr. Patel:**
He had also returned from tour. [indistinct] commentary very well. [indistinct] In Nariya[?] he's supposed to be the best scholar in Sanskrit, not only a big //bhakta// also, but a Vaiṣṇava. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...there is no sex life. [break]

**Girirāja:**
"...is so potent that the more one advances in this line, the more he loses his attraction for material life."

**Dr. Patel:**
[indistinct] people used to castrate themselves. They always want sex.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. That is artificial.

**Dr. Patel:**
I have read somewhere. One sect of //sādhus// who [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not the way.

**Dr. Patel:**
Have you read it? I have read it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Even I do not... No. These are all nonsense.

**Girirāja:**
"One who is actually deriving..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the disease, material disease, to become lusty. So if one actually hears from the authority //rāsa-līlā,// then he is no more lusty. That is the test. That is the test.

**Dr. Patel:**
He becomes [indistinct]. This //kāma// is always first everywhere in our scientists, I mean...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kāma// is the basic principle of material life. That is explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Puṁsāṁ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etad// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]: "Both men and women, they are attracted in this material world for this sex life." //Mithunī-bhāvam etad. Tayor mithaḥ.// They are... Now, just see in this beach. They are coming all dressed, and the man is attracting woman; woman is attracting man. This is business going on here.

**Dr. Patel:**
You are really... Oscar Wilde has written once...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is the fact. We can see it. We can see it. That's all. Everywhere the same business. In the Western world they are becoming more and more naked. You see? Mini, miniskirt.

**Dr. Patel:**
What they call it?

**Bhāgavata:**
Streaking.

**Dr. Patel:**
No, no, no. What is that called, costume?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Topless. Topless.

**Dr. Patel:**
Topless and bottomless.

**Prabhupāda:**
These things are going on. That means they are attracted. Attracted. //Puṁsāṁ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etad.// They'll dress... Woman will dress very nicely so that she can attract man, and man will also do something which will, he'll attract woman. //Mithunī-bhāvam tayor mitha...// In this way, when they are united---//hṛdāya-granthim āhuḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]], a very strong knot: "Oh, you are mine. I am yours." [laughter] "You are mine. I am yours." In this way they pull on this material life. And then, gradually, "Now we must have good apartment to live and enjoy sex life." //Puṁsāṁ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etad tayor mithaḥ hṛdāya-granthim āhuḥ, tathā gṛha.// "Now have skyscraper building." //Kṣetra:// "Land. We must produce food grains." //Tathā gṛha-kṣetra-suta:// "We must have children."

**Dr. Patel:**
No, but according to the //Taittiriya Upaniṣad...//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, this is... This is the material life.

**Dr. Patel:**
That's right. You are right.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is material... //Tathā gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta. Apta:// friends. I must show: "Just see how I have got big house, nice wife, good bank balance. Come and see. And just glorify me, 'Oh, you are very successful, although you are going to be dog next life.' " This is going on. //Atho gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vitta janasya moho 'yam.// This is illusion. This is illusion. //Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]: "Now I am such and such big man, minister." That's all. And he's... The minister is going to be dog next life. You see? That he does not know. That he does not know. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmā...// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
I don't think they should be dog, become dog. They should become hogs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, dog or hog, but the same. There is no much difference. //Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:19|[SB 2.3.19]]]. These animals have been especially mentioned. //Śva// means dog, and //viḍ-varāha// means hog. //Śva viḍ-varā...//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Viḍ-varāha:// "dirty-eating hog." Not clean-eating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Vit. Vit// means stool. //Śva-viḍ-varāha-uṣṭra. Uṣṭra// means camel, and //khara// means ass. So these //gṛhamedhīs,// they have been described as the //śva viḍ-varāha uṣṭra khara. Bhāgavata// is very strong [laughs] in criticizing. Therefore in the beginning it is said, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]: "All types of cheating religion is rejected." //Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra. Kaitava// means cheating. Śrīdhara Mahārāja..., Śrīdhara Swāmī, he has... //Paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ:// "This //Bhāgavata// is meant for //paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ,// those who are above this material existence, //paramahaṁsas.//" //Bhāgavata// is not meant for ordinary men.

**Dr. Patel:**
Who can make a distinction between milk and water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, no, means he accepts only the milk, not the water. Similarly, this whole world is mixture of spirit and matter, so he rejects matter; he takes only spirit. That is //paramahaṁsa.// Go on.

**Girirāja:**
"Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura points out that according to //Bhagavad-gītā,// the Brahmā day and the Brahmā night are periods of solar years expanding 4,300,000 multiplied by one thousand..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Four, I think. This one?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes, 747. Jumbo.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is 447, yes. [break]

**Bhāgavata:**
...celebrate.

**Prabhupāda:**
The celebration is you have to fast day and night and four times offer worship to the Lord Śiva.

**Dr. Patel:**
And drink //bhāṅg// also. [other Indian men make indistinct comments]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that is not recommended. But they can do... They do all now...

**Bhāgavata:**
So we should observe this festival, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not necessarily.

**Bhāgavata:**
Not necessary. [end]
