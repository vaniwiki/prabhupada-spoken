**Prabhupāda:**
You cannot, go on. [break] ...Tirupati. These rascals are getting money and investing for television.

**Indian man:**
Industry.

**Prabhupāda:**
You see? They should have given to us for distributing Kṛṣṇa consciousness all..., but these rascals will not do that.

**Indian man:**
[continuing the reading] "In the Vedic scriptures, therefore, one is recommended to give charity to a //brāhmaṇa.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they are not //brāhmaṇa.// All //śūdras,// Communist.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Janma jāyate śūdraḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Especially, especially that Andhra government is Communist government.

**Indian man:**
"And by so doing, one pleases Lord Viṣṇu and all the demigods. The pilgrims take bath, worship the Deity and give in charity. They are also recommended to fast one day." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that after attaining human form of body he is not degraded.

**Dr. Patel:**
That is wrong.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is wrong.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kathopaniṣad// says that. [Sanskrit]. People, according to their...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //karma.//

**Dr. Patel:**
...knowledge and according to their //karma,// even they become these trees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man:**
"Vidyadhara himself states that even though he was a demigod, he was condemned to become a serpent. But because he was touched by the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, he immediately came to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He admitted, however, that in his previous life he was actually sinful." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...observing //Śiva-rātri,// Nanda Mahārāja and all the cowherds men, they increased their attachment for Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
[continuing the reading] "After this incident, on a very pleasant night both Kṛṣṇa and His elder brother Balarāma, who are inconceivably powerful, went into the forest of Vṛndāvana." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
"Dressing is artificial. It is not required." Yes. "This naked body is very nice." [break] No, you don't... You cannot be //nāga-bābā.// That is not good. [break] If one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, all these rascaldom becomes charming. When one is Kṛṣṇa conscious these things are not appeal.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
"Kṛṣṇa's transcendental form, quali..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Law is there. [breaks]

[indistinct] [end]
