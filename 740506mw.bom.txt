**Prabhupāda:**
...[break] ...speak in all language, even in the animal, birds' language. //Babhudaka.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Keśi-nisūdana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Dr. Patel:**
//Keśi.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Keśi-nisūdana.//

**Yadubara:**
[continuing the reading] "Keśi rushed toward with Lord with great..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...control his mouth.

**Dr. Patel:**
...are doing this because practically amongst all the, I mean, animals, lower and higher. There are demons who are against. Even horse, even birds, even snake. Eh?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Yadubara:**
"As soon as Keśi reached Him..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...was not so cheap. He had to pay proper price.

**Dr. Patel:**
In Europe also they were eloping away with these girls. That young eloping [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Europeans, they are also coming from //kṣatriya// family.

**Yadubara:**
"I shall also see how You..." [break] "...Your internal potency You have set up the influence of //māyā.//" Is that is part of the internal potency?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Yes. What is your question?

**Yadubara:**
Well, I thought it was the external potency.

**Prabhupāda:**
For Him there is no external, internal. For Kṛṣṇa there is no external, internal. You cannot understand this. Kṛṣṇa is absolute. For me there is external, internal, but for Kṛṣṇa there is no external, internal because His energy... The external energy is also His energy, and internal His energy. Therefore He's everything. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [Hindi] For electrician there is no difference between refrigerator and heater. He knows how to adjust it. For me, this is heater; this is refrigerator. Like that.

**Yadubara:**
"You have taken Your birth in the Yadu dynasty..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Kṛṣṇa says, //ātma-māyayā. Ātma-māyayā,// His own energy. So the material energy and the spiritual, both of them are His energy. So even if He appears in a material body, it does not act as material body; it act as spiritual body. Just like same example: the expert electrician, he can turn the refrigerator into heater. Is it not? That is the it. Hare Kṛṣṇa. For Him there is nothing, no distinction, because He is absolute. Similarly, to take the side of the devotee and to kill the enemy of Kṛṣṇa, they are all the same.

**Brahmānanda:**
Inside of the devotee?

**Prabhupāda:**
Or to kill the demon, that is His mercy. Both of them. It is not that materially, as we think, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is taking side of this man and killing this man." No. Still, He is neutral, absolute.

**Brahmānanda:**
The //sahajiyās,// they don't know that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Brahmānanda:**
//Sahajiyās,// they just go towards like the //rasa-līlā,// and they avoid the demon-killing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Brahmānanda:**
The //sahajiyās.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, they are rascals. Kick them out. They think everything is easy.

**Dr. Patel:**
What is //sahajiyā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sahajiyā... Sahaj// means easy. Easy-going. They will smoke cigarette, at the same time they will play //rasa-līlā.// This is //sahajiyā.// This is //sahajiyā.// They will do all nonsense; still, they will become God, imitation of God.

**Yadubara:**
"Nārada Muni wanted to impress upon people in general that Kṛṣṇa is fully independent. His activities such as His appearance..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
He played also. //Chor chor kela.// We used to say //chor chor kela:// "Catch up the feet." [Hindi with Dr. Patel] [break] ...and wonderful things, as they are mentioned, they were all manufactured by the demons.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Māyā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, these wonderful scientific advancement, they were done by the demons. So they are demons. These so-called scientist, they're all demons.

**Dr. Patel:**
That way. Palace of Pāṇḍavas were constructed by //māyā.// This //māyā..//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
So they were all engineers.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, engineer... Engineer are also demons, but he is no longer demon. Now doctors are demon. [laughter] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...land only for this beach.

**Dr. Patel:**
But you are going away.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I am... [Dr. Patel laughs] I am here. [break] Very soon. [break] Living entities are there in the sand. How do they say there is no life in the moon? I cannot understand. What they are eating within the sand?

**Dr. Patel:**
Not that, but our definition of life is, I mean, not really complete. It is not complete. We mean... Life means anything which, I mean, which breathes, which beats. That is all humbug. Everything is life, to tell the truth.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, even distinction, life and matter, here is sand. How these animals are living within the sand? And not only that. Now it is... Because it is wet, they are living. When it is very scorchy hot, then also living.

**Dr. Patel:**
That is //māyā.// This is all //māyā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Living entity can exist in any condition. In the sun globe there is life. Hmm. Go on. [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
Life is //caitanya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //caitanya. Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
Without //caitanya// nothing can exist.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
I think even in an atom there is //caitanya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. //Aṇḍāntara-stha paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. There is. [//japa//] Go on.

**Yadubara:**
"I can be sure this opportunity..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is His energy, so therefore Kṛṣṇa cannot be under the influence of material energy. [break] Just like, what is called, shade and light. They are the same thing, but shade means the other side of light, absence of light. But light can be there at any time. It is not that because it is shade, there cannot be any light. And this light of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is eradicating the darkness of the shady material world.

**Yadubara:**
"Similarly, Kṛṣṇa, the original..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...taking so much care of the body. Why? Because there is consciousness. Therefore consciousness is important thing, not this body. [break] ...that "Kaṁsa, this rascal, is sending me to Kṛṣṇa. I'll be able to see Him." That's all. His business was to see Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
He was a diplomat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...between demons and gods. So god abides by the order of the Supreme Lord; the demons do not. That's all. They do, indirectly, by force. Just like the demon has to die.

**Dr. Patel:**
Both were the sons of Kaśyapa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Kaśyapa, gods and demons. By their behavior one sect became demons, no?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Yes. //Vyāvahāreṇa jāyante.// Canakya Paṇḍita has said, //na kaścid kasyacid mitro na kaścid kasyacid ripuḥ, vyāvahāreṇa jāyante:// "Who is friend and who is enemy, it can be understood by the behavior." //Vyāvahāreṇa jāyante mitrāṇi ripavas tathā.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mitrāṇi ripavas tathā.// By their... When there is coming action, then you find out who is friend and who is enemy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] This is very nice [indistinct].

**Dr. Patel:**
Now all that society, any decent society.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Dr. Patel:**
That Mr. Nair...

**Prabhupāda:**
Mr. Nair also, in Calcutta, many times. [//japa//] [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
Irish or English?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Irish. He established the Home Rule, Home Rule Party, in India.

**Dr. Patel:**
And he fell off from Gandhijī's movement.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Go on. [break] //...rāga// of love. When one goes to see his beloved and thinks so many things, "I'll do this, I'll do this, I'll do this," that is //pūrva-rāga.// [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [break] //...gopīs// as //krūra,// not //akrūra.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes, because he was taking away Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma from there. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. Kṛṣṇa recognizes immediately who preaches the gospel of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Shall we go back? They are all [indistinct] there. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] [//japa//] [break] ...uncle, His father's cousin.

**Dr. Patel:**
Uddhava was His cousin.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] //...kabe śuddha ha'be mana, kabe hāma herabo, śrī vṛndāvana// [Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura].

**Dr. Patel:**
This is Bengali. Bengali.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yadubara:**
“ 'When my mind will be purified after leaving the...' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Vaiṣṇava //kavi// has sung,

> viṣaya chāriyā, se rase mājīyā,
> mukhe bala hari hari

Unless you are free from the material desires, you cannot enjoy what is the celestial or spiritual bliss in chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// If one has got material desires, he cannot enjoy.

> viṣaya chāriyā, se rase mājīyā,
> mukhe bala hari hari

[break] ...can see here United Nation actually. Here is Britisher, here is American, here is African, here is Indian, here is Hindu, Canadian, Hindu, Muslim, Christian---all. This is United Nation. Just let them see practically what is United Nation. //Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra//---all combined in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why do they not see? The so-called unity, brotherhood, why do they not see the reality?

**Dr. Patel:**
United Nations were created...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, not only United Nation; united in everything, "universal brotherhood," whatever you call---here is the example.

**Dr. Patel:**
So-called United Nations were created not for unity.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, either so-called United Nation or so-called nation. Here is also there is nation. What do they know about nation? Everyone, he is interested with his own pocket, that's all. "What money is coming in my pocket." That's all. Where is the nationality? If there was nationality, why such havoc could have happened? Now the strike is going on. There is no feeling of nationality because they are not thinking of the nation; they are thinking of their own pocket, that's all. Where is the nationality? They are simply bogus slogans. Actual unity, nationality, universality, is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is a fact. Let them see. Men, women also. There are women also. We do not hate anyone. "Come on. Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striya vaiśyās tatha śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]

Here is the unity for everyone, under the shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
This M. N. Raya, you know, who advocated that humanism, for which he was banished by the Communist fellows, because the root of M. N. Raya was in Hinduism, after all. It is very difficult for us to think about so-called Communism. But religion itself is communistic.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. We, we don't think in terms of Hinduism. We don't think.

**Dr. Patel:**
No. But we have been actually brought up religiously as communists, religious communists.

**Prabhupāda:**
Spiritual communists. Religious, religious upon strict sense of religion. Religion means spiritualism.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes, spiritual communism.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. Religion means to abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa. That is religion. Other things are cheating. If they have no sense of God, they do not know what is God, how to abide by the orders of God, that is not religion. Therefore //Bhāgavata// says, //dharmaḥ-projjhita kaitavo atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]: "All cheating types of religion system is rejected, kicked out from this //Bhāgavata.//" They're all cheating. "I am God," "You are God," "I am everything," "You are..." This is not religion. It is all humbug religion. Go on. [break] ...has written about Kṛṣṇa by Vyāsadeva, and people say, "There was no Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, it is all fictitious." Vyāsadeva had to take so much trouble for some fictitious. Just see their intelligence. Even no common sense. Why Śukadeva Gosvāmī will take interest? Why Vyāsadeva will write such book? Therefore they do not recognize that //Bhāgavata// is written by Vyāsadeva. But how they can deny? //Bhagavad-gītā,// that is also written by Vyāsadeva.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
So-called scholars like Radhakrishnan says, "It is..., Vyāsadeva, is some imaginary character."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, just see.

**Dr. Patel:**
Why they say even Vyāsadeva is imaginary?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dr. Patel:**
They say, some of them, there was not one Vyāsadeva, but multiple Vyāsas, and all sorts of things.

**Prabhupāda:**
So which Vyāsa you accept? There may be multiple, but which Vyāsa? That means if someone... I do not know if there were multiple Vyāsadeva.

**Dr. Patel:**
Vyāsa is the surname.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Vyāsa, Vyāsadeva... The //guru// is called Vyāsa. That is one of... But the original Vyāsa is one. Just like we. We worship the birthday of //guru// as //Vyāsa-pūjā// day, because //guru// is representative of Vyāsa.

[break] ...eating, if this //tāmbūla// is offered and sandal pulp, it becomes a garland. It becomes very comfortable. Yes.

**Yadubara:**
"When Akrūra finished eating..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The guest may be comfortable. //Sukham āsīnam// [SB 11.2.3]. He is seated very nicely, comfortably, then talk. This is the system, receiving guests and talking. [break] "Beware of dog." "Beware of dog. I am living with dog. Don't come here." He poses that "I am friend of... Dog is my best friend, so don't come here." Yes. His overfaithfulness has obliged him to take the body of a dog.

**Yadubara:**
"The Vedic system of receiving a guest was completely observed by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself to teach all others how..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Even if you receive at home your enemy, you shall treat him in such a way that he is not afraid. //Akuto 'bhayam.// That "I have come to the house of enemy and he can do me harm at any time," no. He should be received in such a way that he will be completely free from these thoughts that "I am his enemy."

**Dr. Patel:**
These Arabs were well known about receiving these guests like that, but they have learned from India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they were all Indians. All this land... Now just like they have become Pakistan. They were Indians, Hindu. Because we degraded in our culture, the divisions, the so many divisions... Otherwise whole world are under Vedic culture. As soon as the //brāhmaṇas// and the..., or //kṣatriyas,// they degenerated, the whole society disrupted.

**Dr. Patel:**
Now the //brāhmaṇa// is trying to regenerate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now he is above //brāhmaṇa. Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. He is //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// not //brāhmaṇa.//

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

Anyone who is in the devotional service, he is already //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā.// [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...Bengali proverb, //tomār je balo asa, mussulmaner mūrgī pāsa,// [laughter] that "You love me just like the Muhammadan loves the //mūrgī,// chicken, every day cutting one." [break] I thought that they are taking so much care of the cows, but later I understood not taking care; they are making them fattened to kill. The whole Western world. Why America? In your country also. In England? This is the process. Letchmore Heath in our Bhaktivedanta Manor, so many cows were there. It is meant for killing.

**Dr. Patel:**
You know, when during Christmas they bring the turkey, they fatten it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dr. Patel:**
These Christians, during the Christmas they buy a turkey one month before...

**Prabhupāda:**
But that is not the injunction of Christ. They have made it.

**Dr. Patel:**
No, no. That cannot be injunction of a saint like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. He says, "Thou shall not kill." General order.

**Dr. Patel:**
Christ was a great //bhāgavata-bhakta.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Dr. Patel:**
He was a //bhakta.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I said in many lectures that Christianism means Vaiṣṇavism. Where is the Christian?

**Dr. Patel:**
Vaiṣṇavism. Totally Vaiṣṇavism.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Christianity it is really Vaiṣṇavism, but they, unfortunately... The Church...

**Prabhupāda:**
Muhammadanism... Muhammadanism...

**Dr. Patel:**
The Church has spoiled it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dr. Patel:**
Church has defaced it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everywhere.

**Dr. Patel:**
It is the Church, Christian Church, which has defaced Christism.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Everywhere the followers make the whole thing bungled. Hmm. Go on. [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
No, He saw them there.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, He never went. Not that. Never went, because all of them were thinking of Kṛṣṇa always. Therefore He never went.

**Dr. Patel:**
But they met again in...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vṛndāvanaṁ parityajya na padam ekaṁ gacchati.// [//Yamala-tantra,// quoted in //Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta// 1.5.461]. Kṛṣṇa... Physically it was seen that Kṛṣṇa left, but Kṛṣṇa remained within their mind.

[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [Hindi] [break] No, Kṛṣṇa came also.

**Śrīdhara:**
"We //gopīs// of Vṛndāvana, having left our homes, friends and relatives, have become Kṛṣṇa's maidservants, but He is..." [break] [end]
