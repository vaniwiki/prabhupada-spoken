**Prabhupāda:**
...the moon planet, there is no rainfall?

**Karandhara:**
No, according to scientists there is no [indistinct] rainfall on the moon.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Bhagavān:**
It's very hot and very cold.

**Yogeśvara:**
Have they made another mistake? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? And there is no water also.

**Karandhara:**
No.

**Bhagavān:**
No water.

**Yogeśvara:**
They say that the moon is covered by a very thick layer of dust.

**Prabhupāda:**
But according to our //śāstra,// moon is one of the heavenly planets. [break] ...is moon in any way? Because there is no water?

**Karandhara:**
They say that if they want to set up some houses there, they have to..., everything has to be brought there. There's nothing there to use.

**Prabhupāda:**
How the house will be brought there?

**Karandhara:**
Well, they plan on in future building stations and...

**Prabhupāda:**
The water has to be taken from the station?

**Karandhara:**
Yes. Air, water, everything has to be taken.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. And still they must go there. And we are proposing another planet, Vaikuṇṭha planet; they are not willing to go there.

**Yogeśvara:**
They have found one use for all this space travel. They've decided to... They've experimented grounding lenses, grinding lenses in outer space, since there's less dust. They can grind lenses that are more perfect.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Spectacle glass. Good advantage.

**Bhagavān:**
There's another purpose. Instead of testing bombs on the earth, they are trying to test bombs on the moon. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**

> piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya
> māyā-grasta jīvera se bhāva udaya
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

//Piśācī,// ghostly-haunted person, as he speaks so many nonsense, similarly, these persons who are captivated by //māyā,// they also speak all nonsense. Ghostly-haunted persons. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [//japa//] What is that? You want to return?

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
There's a park over there. It's very nice to go to.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
The entrance is a little further down the road.

**Bhagavān:**
Over here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Look up in the sky here and you can see all the different planets and stars. Can you also look up into the sky, the //brahma-jyotir,// and see all the different Vaikuṇṭha planets?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. The space is three fourths there. Here the space is one fourth. In one-fourth space there are unlimited number of universes, //ananta-koṭi.// This material world is situated in a one-fourth space, and three-fourths space in the spiritual world. Just imagine how big it is. There the Vaikuṇṭha planets, each planet is as big as the universe. So big. There are aeroplanes also. It is described in the Second Canto of //Bhāgavatam.//

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
When one looks up towards Goloka Vṛndāvana... Just as the... There's a description in //Brahma-saṁhitā// of Goloka Vṛndāvana with the lotus petals, corolla of lotus petals.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Lotus... These Vaikuṇṭhas are like lotus petals, and the Kṛṣṇaloka is the middle portion, whorl of the lotus. [aside:] This way? [some French discussion in background] [break] So their body and your body has nothing to do individually. //Harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. [break] ...living entities. As soon as there is opportunity, they are coming out. [break] ...as we have got experience within this planet there is water. And the watermelon, they grow very nicely in the desert. And you see, within the watermelon, there is water. So wherefrom this water is coming? Hmm? Wherefrom the water is coming?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The //Bhagavad-gītā// says that the world is made up of eight energies: earth, air, water, fire, ether...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. That //Bhagavad-gītā// says. I am talking you; you are scientist. Wherefrom the watermelon water comes, and they are grown in the desert?

**Karandhara:**
Well, they say the watermelon has an extensive root system which extracts the water from the...

**Prabhupāda:**
So that means there is water.

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So how you can say there is no water in the moon planet?

**Karandhara:**
Well, they can take samples in the desert and find out if there is certain degree of moisture in the soil. They have taken the same samples on the moon and say that there is no moisture.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why the moon planet is bereft of? Material..., anything material, it is combination of earth, water, fire, air, ether. Anything material. It is a combination.

**Karandhara:**
Well, there are probably very minute quantities of moisture on the moon. But they say nothing significant, nothing suitable for agriculture.

**Yogeśvara:**
There are no plants growing on the moon. In the desert we find some plants, but they have not found any vegetation on the moon.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means they have not gone thoroughly. One portion of it.

**Karandhara:**
Well, they have scanners on these satellites which pick up vegetation or life. From hundreds miles away, it will show up on a screen. And they sent it all around the moon, and it hasn't shown any indication of any organic matter or life. They can send this satellite up around the earth planet and they can locate fields of corn, fields of wheat, from hundreds of miles away, just by the way it shows up on these different electronic devices. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Take one of these... [break]

**Yogeśvara:**
...the vegetables, made of different elements. [break] ...and they say they found indications of elements that were existing at the time of creation that went into the making of the living entities... [end]
