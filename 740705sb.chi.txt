Hmm. So, Kṛṣṇa is covered by a curtain, //māyā-javanikā. Javanikā// means curtain, and //māyā,// "deluding." We have explained yesterday that Kṛṣṇa is existing outside and inside. Outside... Inside He is existing, //īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe,// pointing out. //Hṛd-deśe// means this heart; the Lord within, //īśvaraḥ.// Not only within the heart, but within the atoms, as it is stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,//

> eko 'py asau racayituṁ jagad-aṇḍa-koṭiṁ
> yac-chaktir asti jagad-aṇḍa-cayā yad-antaḥ
> aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.35]

Govinda, because He has entered within this universe, therefore the cosmic manifestation is possible. Otherwise it is not. Just like I am the soul, you are the soul. Because you have entered this body or I am entered this body, therefore the movement of the body is possible. As soon as I or you leave this body, it is dull, no more, no movement. It is very easy to understand. Similarly, how the movement of the cosmic manifestation is going on, the so-called scientist, philosopher, rascals, they do not understand, because Kṛṣṇa has entered. It is very easy to understand. I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, very minute part. Still, because I have entered this body, therefore the body moves, the activities of the body going on. Is it very difficult to understand?

So, anyone can understand that this lump of matter, big cosmic manifestation, until a thing like me, soul, is there, how it is going on nicely---how the sun is rising in due time, the moon is rising in due time, the oceans are flowing in due order? Everything is in order. That we have to understand by the symptom. It requires little brain. Just like as soon as in the morning you see no more darkness, it is now..., there is light, immediately you can understand there is sun, sunrise is there. Similarly, as soon as you see the world order is going on very nicely, there must be God. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:// "Under My direction," Kṛṣṇa says. He personally says, and if you have got intelligence, you should understand also. But if you are dull rascal, then you cannot understand. Therefore, here it is said, "You dull rascal, you do not know that Kṛṣṇa is covered by a curtain given by //māyā.//" That is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// also, //nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]].

So you have to require..., you have to acquire that knowledge how to understand the existence of God, Kṛṣṇa, everywhere---inside and outside. So Kuntī-devī says that "You are within and outside." Kṛṣṇa is within, within your heart, and Kṛṣṇa is outside also. Otherwise how this big cosmic manifestation is going on? Huh? Not only that; He is everywhere, even within the atom, //aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayān...// Still we cannot understand where is Kṛṣṇa. This is our misfortune. //Duṣkṛtinaḥ, mūḍhāḥ,// they cannot understand. Why they cannot understand? That because they are //duṣkṛtinaḥ,// always engaged in sinful activities. Who can see Kṛṣṇa? Who is not sinful. //Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam// [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]], one who has finished his life of sinful activities, he can understand Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is our request to everyone: Please do not commit these four kinds of sinful activities---illicit sex, meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. This is the preliminary qualification to understand God. Especially one must not kill animals. The Bible also. Therefore it is said, "Thou shall not kill. You rascal, if you want to understand what is God, you must stop this killing art. Thou shall not kill." But these rascals will not understand. This is the mis..., misfortune. And therefore God is always covered to their eyes.

Kuntī-devī therefore said, //māyā-javanikācchannam. Māyā-javanikācchannam ajñā. Ajñā// means rascal, who has no knowledge, dull, dull-headed, //mūḍhāḥ,// ass. These words are used in the //śāstra.// Why //mūḍhāḥ?// The word is used as an..., an ass. The ass, amongst the animal, is the most, I mean to say, what is called, foolish, most foolish. The ass works very hard and bears burden, heavy burden, ton, but he does not know, "Why I am carrying so big burden? Why I have taken so much responsibility?" That he does not know. So here you will find so many big, big politicians, leaders, they have accepted big, big burden like an ass, but they do not know why they are doing so. They do not know. Their only solace is a temporary satisfaction that "I have become president," "I have become this, master," "I have become this," for few years. But he does not know what is his real business. So therefore the //karmīs,// they are working hard day and night, but he does not know why he is working so hard day and night.

So actually, they are working so hard simply for sense gratification. That's all. Therefore //śāstra// says, //nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Śāstra...,// Ṛṣabhadeva says that this body... This is also material body, but there is distinction between this body and the dog's body or the hog's body. The hog is, with this material body, he is working day and night, "Where is stool? Where is stool?" That is his business. As soon as he gets some stool, he eats and he is satisfied: "Now my labor is satisfied." Similarly, those who are working very hard day and night simply for sense gratification, they are no better than the hogs and dogs. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke kaṣṭān kāmān// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. He does not know, "Why I have got this first-class body, human body, civilized body? What is my business?" Not for eating meat and gambling and intoxication. It is for self-realization, to understand what I am, what is God, what is my relationship with God, and what is the aim of my life. It is meant for that.

But they do not know, and because they do not know, asses, //mūḍhas,// Kṛṣṇa says, //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ,// they will not accept the existence of God, although God is inside and outside. This is the description of the //mūḍhāḥ.// Here it is said, //ajñā. Ajñā// means ignorant. And what is Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is //adhokṣajam. Adhok..., adhokṣaja. Adha, adhakṛta. Adhakṛta// means subdued. //Akṣaja,// our knowledge, direct perception. We are very much proud of our eyes, //akṣa.// So Kṛṣṇa's another name is Adhokṣaja: where your eyesight fails to see you, see Kṛṣṇa; therefore he is Adhokṣaja. //Akṣaja jñānam.// Knowledge received through direct perception of the senses is called //akṣaja jñānam,// and Kṛṣṇa is //adhokṣaja,// where knowledge by direct perception cannot reach. And perfection of life is when you become attached to that Adhokṣaja. In another place of //Śrīmad...// [break] Peace will be possible when you develop your loving propensity for the Adhokṣaja, who is beyond your sense perception. Therefore those who are //duṣkṛtinaḥ, mūḍhāḥ//---many languages have been used in the //Vedas//---they do not know what is the aim of life, they are simply thinking, "I am this body," then this kind of thought is there in the dogs and cats also. He is also thinking, "I am this body." So this modern civilization is big dog civilization, that's all. That is not human civilization. Human civilization means that he must be interested to know Kṛṣṇa and God. That is human civilization.

So, //māyā-javanikācchannam ajñādhokṣajam avyayam. Avyayam// means imperishable. //Avyayam na lakṣyase:// they cannot see. //Na lakṣyase,// observed, cannot be observed by them, //na lakṣyase. Mūḍha.// Again the same word is used, //mūḍha. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]], //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. This word is used. One who does not know what is God and what is his relationship with God, he is a //mūḍha.// In so many places, there are so many //śāstras// you will find this word //mūḍha.// Here it is said, //na lakṣyase mūḍha. Mūḍha-dṛśa,// whose sense perception is just like blind man. A blind man is given a elephant, an elephant. Now, "Mr. Blind Man, just understand what is this." So, he is blind, he simply, I mean to say, moves his hand over the leg. "Sir, it is a column. It is a big column." So blind man, he cannot see; he thought that elephant is big, big column. So anyone who is speculating about God, he is the blind man studying the elephant, like that. Or the frog in the well studying Atlantic Ocean. What he will understand? Suppose a frog is informed, "Mr. Frog, Dr. Frog, [laughter] I have seen a big, vast mass of water." "What is that?" "Atlantic Ocean." "How big is it?" "Very, very big." Maybe, he is in the three-feet well. "Four feet?" "No, no, very, very big." "Five feet?" "No, very big." "Six feet?" [laughter] How he will understand the Atlantic Ocean? He can simply imagine, maybe three-feet, four-feet, five-feet well. But beyond all feet, that he cannot understand. Because of //mūḍha-dṛśa,// his direct perception, and he is a rascal.

So by mental speculation, so-called big, big philosophers, they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa can be understood by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. By the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa comes. Kṛṣṇa is visible. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena// [Bs. 5.38]. When you are trained up how to love God, Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa will reveal Himself, and you will see Him. //Premāñjana-cchurita.// Not with these eyes, but another eyes. What is that eyes? //Premāñjana,// love, the ointment of love, when it is smeared in your eyes, then you can see. Just like there is medicine, eye ointment, or //surma,// in India it is called //surma.// Sometimes you apply, your vision becomes very cleansed, and you can see things very nicely. So we have to cleanse our eyes to see Kṛṣṇa, by the ointment of love of Kṛṣṇa. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilo..., santaḥ// [Bs. 5.38]. Then, when you are saintly person, //santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti,// He... He is, actually He is already indicated in the //śāstra// that God is situated within your heart. So then when your eyes are clear, then you can see, //hṛdayeṣu,// always existing. But so long you are //mūḍha-dṛśa,// you are mental speculator, the curtain is covered; the covering is there, you cannot see Kṛṣṇa.

//Māyā-javanikācchannam ajñādhokṣajam avyayam na lakṣyase,// "You are not visible," //mūḍha-dṛśa,// "by persons who are rascal and simply believe in direct perception," //mūḍha-dṛśa.// How it is? In Sanskrit language you will find exact example is given, //naṭo nāṭyadharo yathā.// Just like you have gone to see a performance, dramatic performance, and some of your relatives, say your brother or father, is playing there, but he is dressed in such a way that you cannot recognize he is your father. Although he is in your front, the father or the brother whom you see every day, this man, being..., has dressed himself in such a way, he is playing the part of a king or something else, you cannot understand. Somebody says, "Did you see your father is playing?" "Where is my father? Where is my father?" This is the position.

Because Kṛṣṇa is playing His part in a different way. He has got so much business because He is directing the whole universal affair. You can understand, if one man becomes busy in so many things, his brain becomes puzzled. But Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart---not only the human being; the animals, the trees, plants, everyone. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. And what He is doing? He is giving direction. //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am sitting in everyone's heart," //sarvasya ca aham hṛdi sann...// Again //hṛdi,// in the soul, in the heart. //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca,// "I am giving particular direction to everyone." He is forgetting something, He is reminding..., he is reminded something. In this way Kṛṣṇa is doing. //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanam.// How much busy is that? The thief wants to steal something, somebody's house, so he is also praying God, "Please give me some opportunity so that I can steal." So Kṛṣṇa is giving him direction, "All right, you steal in this way." And the same person in whose house the stealing will be committed, he is also praying, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, please protect me from thieves." So he is also believing. That just see Kṛṣṇa's business: He is giving direction to the thief, and giving direction to the person in whose house the stealing will be committed.

So if..., just try to understand how much Kṛṣṇa is busy. And that is God. Although He is performing so many contradictory business, contradictory business, opposing business, still His full brain, His full brain, He does not forget to dance with the //gopīs// at the same time. This is Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa. If you are busy with so many transactions, you forget to see your wife and children and forget. But no. Kṛṣṇa, //goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto// [Bs. 5.37]. Although He is busy dancing with the //gopīs,// although He is busy to play with His cowherd friends, //goloka eva nivasaty,// in this way He is living in the Goloka, and //akhilātma-bhūto,// still He is in everyone's heart and giving direction, all contradiction. This is Kṛṣṇa. Don't try to imitate Kṛṣṇa, rascal. Kṛṣṇa is not so easy. Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa. You are you are. That is real philosophy.

Thank you very much.
