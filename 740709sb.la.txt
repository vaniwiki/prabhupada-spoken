"//Dharma// [in the form of bull] asked: Madam, are you not hail and hearty? Why are you covered with the shadow of grief? It appears by your face that you have become black. Are you suffering from some internal disease, or are you thinking of some relative who is away in a distant place?"

Actually, the cows... When I was in New Vrindaban, our Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja purchased one cow without calf. [children talking]

**Devotee:**
Children have to go out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So that cow was actually crying, because the calf was taken away for slaughtering. It is not that they have no soul, they cannot understand, they have no feeling, but they are helpless. Everything is there. The butchers, the cow slaughterer, or their supporters, they say wrongly that the animal has no soul. This is a rascal philosophy. Why animal has no soul, the question should be.

Here Yamarāja is addressing the cow as //amba,// mother. "Why you are so unhappy, from your face it appears?" So Yamarāja was foolish man, that he is addressing a cow as mother? This is civilization. It doesn't matter one is appearing as a cow or a man or a dog or a demigod or a civilized man, uncivilized man. One who knows that the soul is there... Unless there is soul, how Yamarāja is asking the cow, "It appears that you are very much bereaved. So what is the cause, mother, of your bereavement?"

So this culture, that Yamarāja is asking an animal, mother... Without any soul? No. Everyone has soul. The rascals, they do not know it. One has to become //paṇḍita. Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ,// in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said. So those who are actually learned, they know. They know that one may be a living entity, one may be a tree, one may be an animal, one may be a cow, one may be an elephant, one may be a learned //brāhmaṇa// scholar, one may be a //caṇḍāla,// untouchable---everyone is a soul. //Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ.//

> vidyā-vinaya-sampanne
> brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
> śuni caiva śva-pāke ca
> paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]

//Paṇḍita,// one who is learned, he knows that all of them, animal, trees, plants or human being or demigods, everyone is the spirit soul. Now they are simply encaged in different bodies according to different //karma.//

The soul, part and parcel of God, wanted to imitate God's supremacy, and they wanted to enjoy. But in the spiritual world there cannot be second enjoyer. The only enjoyer is Kṛṣṇa. //Bhoktāraṁ sarva-loka..., bhoktāraṁ sarva-yajñānāṁ sarva-loka...// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. He is the supreme proprietor, supreme being. In the dictionary you will find "the supreme being." "Supreme being" means nobody can be equal to Him, nobody can be greater than Him. That is..., means supreme. So how one can become an imitator of Kṛṣṇa? That is not possible. That imitation is possible here in this material world, because they are all rascals. So one rascal may claim that "I am God," imitation, but as soon as he claims like that, any intelligent man knows that he is a rascal. That's all. That very assertion will establish that he is a rascal.

Nobody can be God. God is one. And religion is also one. If God is one, then how religion can be different? Just like state laws. If the state is one, the law is also, everyone. Now the ordinary law, just like "Keep to the right," if somebody says, "No, this is Christian law; Hindu law, 'Keep to the left,' " will it be accepted? If I say, "I am Hindu, I am coming from India. My law is 'Keep to the left.' " In India, the same thing, "Keep to the left." And many other countries also. So here, because all these laws are made by rascals, in some country you keep to the left, some country you keep to the right. And which is correct, that is unknown. That is unknown. Therefore for the foolish person, "This is Hindu religion," "This is Christian religion," and "This is Muhammadan religion." Religion is one. How it can be Hindu religion, Christian religion? No. Religion is one. God is one; therefore religion is one, because religion means the law or the order given by God. That is religion. Simple definition.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. That //mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja,// "Surrender unto Me," that is religion. So one has to surrender. Either he is a Hindu or a Christian or Muhammadan, he has to surrender. That is religion. One cannot say that because we are professing Christian religion, we haven't got to surrender to God. Will anybody say? Will any Christian will say like that? Or any Hindu will say like that? Or any Muhammadan will say like that? No. Everyone has to surrender to God. That is religion. Therefore in the //Bhāgavata// you will find the verse: //sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. That is first-class religion which is teaching the followers to understand the Supreme.

Now, "Supreme I cannot see." You cannot see; therefore Supreme's name, another name, is Adhokṣaja, "beyond the perception of your experimental knowledge." That is called //adhokṣaja. Adhah-kṛta akṣaja jñānaṁ yatra.// By your experimental knowledge you cannot understand. The same thing, that if you say, "I do not see the President of the United States; therefore I do not believe this law, 'Keep to the left.' " No, no. If you don't believe, that is your business. But as soon as you violate this law, immediately you are under prison. You have seen the President or not seen, it doesn't matter. The law will act. Similarly, you believe in God or do not believe in God, it doesn't matter. The God's order, the God's law, will work on. And for this purpose the material energy is there.

So here it is said... Yamarāja is inquiring the cow because she is very much threatened by the butcher. The butcher was ready to kill, and she was trembling. So Yamarāja is asking, //kaccid bhadre anāmayam ātmanas te.// Just like we would ask some friend or relative that "I think you are all right?" The same thing is being inquired: "Why you are appearing so much bereaved? What is the cause?" //Ālakṣaye.// "It appears that you are within very sorry." //Ālakṣaye bhavatīm antar-ādhim:// "Some distress within yourself." //Dūre bandhuṁ śocasi.// Because in this material world we are always distressed. It is not that we are happy. That is an illusion. That is not fact. We are always distressed. So there are three kinds of distresses: //adhyātmika, adhibhautika// and //adhidaivika.// Here it is inquired that //bhavatīm antarādhim. Adhi.// And //antara// means within the body or within the mind.

So, "Are you suffering some pains on account of your body or mind?" This is called //adhyātmika. Adhyātmika// means the body, the body and the mind. That's called //adhyātmika. Adhibhautika,// sufferings offered by other living entities. And //adhidaivika. Adhidaivika// means sufferings offered by the demigods, just like famine, pestilence, earthquake. You have no hand. You may be a very big, big scientist, but when this trembling of the earth, "Oh, God save us, God save us, God save us." [laughter] Yes. Even that sputnik... Our scientist... Where is scientist? What is that, sputnik? They were asking, "God shall...?"

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Just they were trying to go to the moon.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the story? You can little explain.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That there was an explosion in the Apollo Mission 13, and they could not go to the moon. So they were in danger in outer space. So they were requesting all the people so that "Pray to God so that I can come back safe and sound to this planet." [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
When they are in danger, they pray to God for safe and sound, but when they go to the moon planet: "We are scientist." [laughter] Just see how much foolish they are. When they go to the moon planet, at that time, "God give us permission, we may go"? No. "We are scientists. [laughter] We don't care for God." But when they are in danger, "God save us." [laughter] Just see what kind of scientists they are. This is practical. I am very glad that our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara has mentioned this in his book, //Scientific Basis of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.//

So that is the fact. And there is a version of Tulasi Das in Hindi. It is said, //sukse sabe hari bhaje, duhkhse saha hari bhaje, sukse bhaje khoya//[?]. Or //sukse ara hari bhaje, tu duḥkha hase haya.// It is very nice instruction. The instruction is that when one is distressed, everyone remembers God. Yes. //Duhkhse saba hari bhaje. Saba// means "all." At that time... Just like in the last war, Second..., last war, when everything was in danger, Mr. Churchill started this movement B[?], and they were all going to churches---when the situation was very grave. And in Germany especially, because war was very, going on very seriously, so there was no men, so all the women, they went to the church and pray God, somebody---woman means husband, son or father---prayed, "Let my father come back" or "Let my husband come back" or "my son." But nobody came back. So they became atheist. This is the version of my one German Godbrother friend. So he said that all of them became atheist. Why? Now, they prayed so much to get back their husband or son or father; nobody came back. "Then there is no God." This is their conclusion. That means, "God is our order-supplier. God is our servant." Just like I ask my servant or my disciple, "You do this," and he must do it. We cannot accept God like that. God is neither going to be your servant.

So those who are going to religious life making God as their servant, they will be failure. You must approach God as master. You should become servant. The so-called religionist, they accept God as their order-supplier servant: "I must pray to God..." Whenever there is some inconvenience, "I must pray," or "I must... " Not "must." "At that time I shall pray, and then I shall finish that prayer, and God must supply. If God does not supply, then there is no God." This is the general attitude. But that should not be done. The real religion is, as Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. First of all surrender. Then talk of mercy and this or that. Also, although God is very merciful, even those who are simply asking from God, not prepared to give anything, God is merciful, even though he...

Therefore He has given this field. "All right, you want to become another God or competitor of Me? You live in this material world and begin your life as Brahmā. I give you first-class chance. And then gradually, you become the worm of the stool." [laughter] This is called //karma-kāṇḍīya-vicāra.// First of all we get our very opportunity. Just like you Americans, you have got good opportunity. I have several time mentioned that you have wealth, you have got education, you have got beauty, //janmaiśvarya,// and heritage also. People outside your country, they know, "Oh, he is American. He is very advanced." You have got respect. So this is..., this is due to pious life. If one is pious, he gets all these opportunities. //Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]]. This is... //Janma// means to get birth in high family, aristocratic family, or to become the members of a big nation. This is called //janma. Janma// means birth. And //aiśvarya,// opulence, money. //Janma aiśvarya śruta, aiśvarya// and //śruta. Śruta// means education. And //śrī// means beauty. These four things are outcome of previous pious life. So you have got this opportunity. You have got. Now you utilize these assets of life---nice birth, opulence, beauty, education---for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise, you take the chance of Brahmā, and then go to become the worm of the stool. The law of //karma// is like that.

So one who is opulent in this life, they should be very much careful that "By the grace of God, I have got this opportunity. Now the opportunity should be utilized to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness," means to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is advancement. If anyone understands Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa, You are the greatest..." God is great, we have heard so many times from so many people. But what is God, we did not know. Now we understand that Kṛṣṇa. So if you engage yourself simply to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, simply by thinking of Kṛṣṇa, then your life is successful. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
