===== The Expansions of Advaita Ācārya and Gadādhara Paṇḍita =====

**Prabhupāda:**

/* TEXT 1 */
> advaitāṅghry-abja-bhṛṅgāṁs tān
> sārāsāra-bhṛto ‘khilān
> hitvāsārān sāra-bhṛto
> naumi caitanya-jīvanān

The followers of Śrī Advaita Prabhu were of two kinds. Some were real followers, and the others were false. Rejecting the false followers, I offer my respectful obeisances to Śrī Advaita Ācārya’s real followers, whose life and soul was Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

/* TEXT 2 */
> jaya jaya mahāprabhu śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya
> jaya jaya nityānanda jayādvaita dhanya

All glories to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu! All glories to Lord Nityānanda! All glories to Śrī Advaita Prabhu! All of Them are glorious.

/* TEXT 3 */
> śrī-caitanyāmara-taror
> dvitīya-skandha-rūpiṇaḥ
> śrīmad-advaita-candrasya
> śākhā-rūpān gaṇān numaḥ

I offer my respectful obeisances to the all-glorious Advaita Prabhu, who forms the second branch of the eternal Caitanya tree, and to His followers, who form His subbranches.

/* TEXT 4 */
> vṛkṣera dvitīya skandha---ācārya-gosāñi
> tāṅra yata śākhā ha-ila, tāra lekhā nāñi

Śrī Advaita Prabhu was the second big branch of the tree. There are many subbranches, but it is impossible to mention them all.

/* TEXT 5 */
> caitanya-mālīra kṛpā-jalera secane
> sei jale puṣṭa skandha bāḍe dine dine

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was also the gardener, and as He poured the water of His mercy on the tree, all the branches and subbranches grew, day after day.

/* TEXT 6 */
> sei skandhe yata prema-phala upajila
> sei kṛṣṇa-prema-phale jagat bharila

The fruits of love of Godhead that grew on those branches of the Caitanya tree were so large that they flooded the entire world with love of Kṛṣṇa.

/* TEXT 7 */
> sei jala skandhe kare śākhāte sañcāra
> phale-phule bāḍe,---śākhā ha-ila vistāra

As the trunk and branches were watered, the branches and subbranches spread lavishly, and the tree grew full with fruits and flowers.

/* TEXT 8 */
> prathame ta’ eka-mata ācāryera gaṇa
> pāche dui-mata haila daivera kāraṇa

At first all the followers of Advaita Ācārya shared a single opinion. But later they followed two different opinions, as ordained by providence.

/* TEXT 9 */
> keha ta’ ācārya ājñāya, keha ta’ svatantra
> sva-mata kalpanā kare daiva-paratantra

Some of the disciples strictly accepted the orders of the ācārya, and others deviated, independently concocting their own opinions under the spell of daivī-māyā.

/* TEXT 10 */
> ācāryera mata yei, sei mata sāra
> tāṅra ājñā laṅghi’ cale, sei ta’ asāra

The order of the spiritual master is the active principle in spiritual life. Anyone who disobeys the order of the spiritual master immediately becomes useless.

/* TEXT 11 */
> asārera nāme ihāṅ nāhi prayojana
> bheda jānibāre kari ekatra gaṇana

There is no need to name those who are useless. I have mentioned them only to distinguish them from the useful devotees.

/* TEXT 12 */
> dhānya-rāśi māpe yaiche pātnā sahite
> paścāte pātnā uḍāñā saṁskāra karite

Paddy is mixed with straw at first, and one must fan it to separate the paddy from the straw.

/* TEXT 13 */
> acyutānanda---baḍa śākhā, ācārya-nandana
> ājanma sevilā teṅho caitanya-caraṇa

A big branch of Advaita Ācārya was His son Acyutānanda. From the beginning of his life he engaged in the service of the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya.

/* TEXT 14 */
> caitanya-gosāñira guru---keśava bhāratī
> ei pitāra vākya śuni’ duḥkha pāila ati

When Acyutānanda heard from his father that Keśava Bhāratī was the spiritual master of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was very unhappy.

/* TEXT 15 */
> jagad-gurute tumi kara aiche upadeśa
> tomāra ei upadeśe naṣṭa ha-ila deśa

He told his father, "Your instruction that Keśava Bhāratī is the spiritual master of Caitanya Mahāprabhu will spoil the entire country.

/* TEXT 16 */
> caudda bhuvanera guru---caitanya-gosāñi
> tāṅra guru---anya, ei kona śāstre nāi

"Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the spiritual master of the fourteen worlds, but You say that someone else is His spiritual master. This is not supported by any revealed scripture."

/* TEXT 17 */
> pañcama varṣera bālaka kahe siddhāntera sāra
> śuniyā pāilā ācārya santoṣa apāra

When Advaita Ācārya heard this statement from His five-year-old son Acyutānanda, He felt great satisfaction because of his conclusive judgment.

/* TEXT 18 */
> kṛṣṇa-miśra-nāma āra ācārya-tanaya
> caitanya-gosāñi baise yāṅhāra hṛdaya

Kṛṣṇa Miśra was a son of Advaita Ācārya. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu always sat in his heart.

/* TEXT 19 */
> śrī-gopāla-nāme āra ācāryera suta
> tāṅhāra caritra, śuna, atyanta adbhuta

Śrī Gopāla was another son of Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu. Now just hear about his characteristics, for they are all very wonderful.

/* TEXT 20 */
> guṇḍicā-mandire mahāprabhura sammukhe
> kīrtane nartana kare baḍa prema-sukhe

When Lord Caitanya personally cleansed the Guṇḍicā-mandira in Jagannātha Purī, Gopāla danced in front of the Lord with great love and happiness.

/* TEXT 21 */
> nānā-bhāvodgama dehe adbhuta nartana
> dui gosāñi ‘hari’ bale, ānandita mana

While Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Advaita Prabhu chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra and danced, there were various ecstatic symptoms in Their bodies, and Their minds were very pleased.

/* TEXT 22 */
> nācite nācite gopāla ha-ila mūrcchita
> bhūmete paḍila, dehe nāhika saṁvita

While all of them danced, Gopāla, dancing and dancing, fainted and fell to the ground unconscious.

/* TEXT 23 */
> duḥkhita ha-ilā ācārya putra kole lañā
> rakṣā kare nṛsiṁhera mantra paḍiyā

Advaita Ācārya Prabhu became very unhappy. Taking His son on His lap, He began to chant the Nṛsiṁha mantra for his protection.

/* TEXT 24 */
> nānā mantra paḍena ācārya, nā haya cetana
> ācāryera duḥkhe vaiṣṇava karena krandana

Advaita Ācārya chanted various mantras, but Gopāla did not come to consciousness. Thus all the Vaiṣṇavas present cried in sorrow at His plight.

/* TEXT 25 */
> tabe mahāprabhu, tāṅra hṛde hasta dhari’
> ‘uṭhaha, gopāla,’ kaila bala ‘hari’ ‘hari’

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu then put His hand on the chest of Gopāla and told him, "My dear Gopāla, get up and chant the holy name of the Lord!"

/* TEXT 26 */
> uṭhila gopāla prabhura sparśa-dhvani śuni’
> ānandita hañā sabe kare hari-dhvani

When he heard this sound and felt the touch of the Lord, Gopāla immediately got up, and all the Vaiṣṇavas chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra in jubilation.

/* TEXT 27 */
> ācāryera āra putra---śrī-balarāma
> āra putra---‘svarūpa’-śākhā, ‘jagadīśa’ nāma

The other sons of Advaita Ācārya were Śrī Balarāma, Svarūpa and Jagadīśa.

/* TEXT 28 */
> ‘kamalākānta viśvāsa’-nāma ācārya-kiṅkara
> ācārya-vyavahāra saba---tāṅhāra gocara

Advaita Ācārya’s very confidential servant named Kamalākānta Viśvāsa knew all the dealings of Advaita Ācārya.

/* TEXT 29 */
> nīlācale teṅho eka patrikā likhiyā
> pratāparudrera pāśa dila pāṭhāiyā

When Kamalākānta Viśvāsa was in Jagannātha Purī, he sent a note through someone to Mahārāja Pratāparudra.

/* TEXT 30 */
> sei patrīra kathā ācārya nāhi jāne
> kona pāke sei patrī āila prabhu-sthāne

No one knew of that note, but somehow or other it reached the hands of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

/* TEXT 31 */
> se patrīte lekhā āche---ei ta’ likhana
> īśvaratve ācāryere kariyāche sthāpana

That note established Advaita Ācārya as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

/* TEXT 32 */
> kintu tāṅra daive kichu ha-iyāche ṛṇa
> ṛṇa śodhibāre cāhi taṅkā śata-tina

But it also mentioned that Advaita Ācārya had recently incurred a debt of about three hundred rupees that Kamalākānta Viśvāsa wanted to liquidate.

/* TEXT 33 */
> patra paḍiyā prabhura mane haila duḥkha
> bāhire hāsiyā kichu bale candra-mukha

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu became unhappy upon reading the note, although His face still shone as brightly as the moon. Thus, smiling, He spoke as follows.

/* TEXT 34 */
> ācāryere sthāpiyāche kariyā īśvara
> ithe doṣa nāhi, ācārya---daivata īśvara

"He has established Advaita Ācārya as an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is nothing wrong in this, for He is indeed the Lord Himself.

/* TEXT 35 */
> īśvarera dainya kari’ kariyāche bhikṣā
> ataeva daṇḍa kari’ karāiba śikṣā

"But he has made the incarnation of Godhead a poverty-stricken beggar. Therefore I shall punish him in order to correct him."

/* TEXT 36 */
> govindere ājñā dila,---"iṅhā āji haite
> bāuliyā viśvāse ethā nā dibe āsite"

The Lord ordered Govinda, "From today on, do not allow that bāuliyā Kamalākānta Viśvāsa to come here."

/* TEXT 37 */
> daṇḍa śuni’ ‘viśvāsa’ ha-ila parama duḥkhita
> śuniyā prabhura daṇḍa ācārya harṣita

When Kamalākānta Viśvāsa heard about this punishment by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he was very unhappy, but when Advaita Prabhu heard about it, He was greatly pleased.

/* TEXT 38 */
> viśvāsere kahe,---tumi baḍa bhāgyavān
> tomāre karila daṇḍa prabhu bhagavān

Seeing Kamalākānta Viśvāsa unhappy, Advaita Ācārya Prabhu told him, "You are greatly fortunate to have been punished by the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

/* TEXT 39 */
> pūrve mahāprabhu more karena sammāna
> duḥkha pāi’ mane āmi kailuṅ anumāna

"Formerly Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu always respected Me as His senior, but I did not like such respect. Therefore, My mind being afflicted by unhappiness, I made a plan.

/* TEXT 40 */
> mukti---śreṣṭha kari’ kainu vāśiṣṭha vyākhyāna
> kruddha hañā prabhu more kaila apamāna

"Thus I expounded the Yoga-vāśiṣṭha, which considers liberation the ultimate goal of life. For this the Lord became angry at Me and treated Me with apparent disrespect.

/* TEXT 41 */
> daṇḍa pāñā haila mora parama ānanda
> ye daṇḍa pāila bhāgyavān śrī-mukunda

"When chastised by Lord Caitanya, I was very happy to receive a punishment similar to that awarded Śrī Mukunda.

/* TEXT 42 */
> ye daṇḍa pāila śrī-śacī bhāgyavatī
> se daṇḍa prasāda anya loka pābe kati

"A similar punishment was awarded to mother Śacīdevī. Who could be more fortunate than she to receive such punishment?"

/* TEXT 43 */
> eta kahi’ ācārya tāṅre kariyā āśvāsa
> ānandita ha-iyā āila mahāprabhu-pāśa

After pacifying Kamalākānta Viśvāsa in this way, Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu went to see Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

/* TEXT 44 */
> prabhuke kahena---tomāra nā bujhi e līlā
> āmā haite prasāda-pātra karilā kamalā

Śrī Advaita Ācārya told Lord Caitanya, "I cannot understand Your transcendental pastimes. You have shown more favor to Kamalākānta than You generally show to Me.

/* TEXT 45 */
> āmāreha kabhu yei nā haya prasāda
> tomāra caraṇe āmi ki kainu aparādha

"The favor You have shown Kamalākānta is so great that even to Me You have never shown such favor. What offense have I committed at Your lotus feet so as not to be shown such favor?"

/* TEXT 46 */
> eta śuni’ mahāprabhu hāsite lāgilā
> bolāiyā kamalākānte prasanna ha-ilā

Hearing this, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu laughed with satisfaction and immediately called Kamalākānta Viśvāsa.

/* TEXT 47 */
> ācārya kahe, ihāke kene dile daraśana
> dui prakārete kare more viḍambana

Advaita Ācārya then said to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Why have You called back this man and allowed him to see You? He has cheated Me in two ways."

/* TEXT 48 */
> śuniyā prabhura mana prasanna ha-ila
> duṅhāra antara-kathā duṅhe se jānila

When Caitanya Mahāprabhu heard this, His mind was satisfied. Only They could understand each other’s minds.

/* TEXT 49 */
> prabhu kahe---bāuliyā, aiche kāhe kara
> ācāryera lajjā-dharma-hāni se ācara

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu instructed Kamalākānta, "You are a bāuliyā, one who does not know things as they are. Why do you act in this way? Why do you invade the privacy of Advaita Ācārya and damage His religious principles?

/* TEXT 50 */
> pratigraha kabhu nā karibe rāja-dhana
> viṣayīra anna khāile duṣṭa haya mana

"Advaita Ācārya, My spiritual master, should never accept charity from rich men or kings, because if a spiritual master accepts money or grains from such materialists his mind becomes polluted.

/* TEXT 51 */
> mana duṣṭa ha-ile nahe kṛṣṇera smaraṇa
> kṛṣṇa-smṛti vinu haya niṣphala jīvana

"When one’s mind is polluted, it is very difficult to remember Kṛṣṇa, and when remembrance of Lord Kṛṣṇa is hampered, one’s life is unproductive.

/* TEXT 52 */
> loka-lajjā haya, dharma-kīrti haya hāni
> aiche karma nā kariha kabhu ihā jāni’

"Thus one becomes unpopular in the eyes of the people in general, for this damages his religiosity and fame. A Vaiṣṇava, especially one who acts as a spiritual master, must not act in such a way. One should always be conscious of this fact."

/* TEXT 53 */
> ei śikṣā sabākāre, sabe mane kaila
> ācārya-gosāñi mane ānanda pāila

When Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave this instruction to Kamalākānta, all present considered it to be meant for everyone. Thus Advaita Ācārya was greatly pleased.

/* TEXT 54 */
> ācāryera abhiprāya prabhu-mātra bujhe
> prabhura gambhīra vākya ācārya samujhe

Only Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu could understand the intentions of Advaita Ācārya, and Advaita Ācārya appreciated the grave instruction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

/* TEXT 55 */
> ei ta’ prastāve āche bahuta vicāra
> grantha-bāhulya-bhaye nāri likhibāra

In this statement there are many confidential considerations. I do not write of them all, fearing an unnecessary increase in the volume of the book.

/* TEXT 56 */
> śrī-yadunandanācārya---advaitera śākhā
> tāṅra śākhā-upaśākhāra nāhi haya lekhā

The fifth branch of Advaita Ācārya was Śrī Yadunandana Ācārya, who had so many branches and subbranches that it is impossible to write of them.

/* TEXT 57 */
> vāsudeva dattera teṅho kṛpāra bhājana
> sarva-bhāve āśriyāche caitanya-caraṇa

Śrī Yadunandana Ācārya was a student of Vāsudeva Datta, and he received all his mercy. Therefore he could accept Lord Caitanya’s lotus feet, from all angles of vision, as the supreme shelter.

/* TEXT 58 */
> bhāgavatācārya, āra viṣṇudāsācārya
> cakrapāṇi ācārya, āra ananta ācārya

Bhāgavata Ācārya, Viṣṇudāsa Ācārya, Cakrapāṇi Ācārya and Ananta Ācārya were the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth branches of Advaita Ācārya.

/* TEXT 59 */
> nandinī, āra kāmadeva, caitanya-dāsa
> durlabha viśvāsa, āra vanamāli-dāsa

Nandinī, Kāmadeva, Caitanya dāsa, Durlabha Viśvāsa and Vanamālī dāsa were the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth and fourteenth branches of Śrī Advaita Ācārya.

/* TEXT 60 */
> jagannātha kara, āra kara bhavanātha
> hṛdayānanda sena, āra dāsa bholānātha

Jagannātha Kara, Bhavanātha Kara, Hṛdayānanda Sena and Bholānātha dāsa were the fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth branches of Advaita Ācārya.

/* TEXT 61 */
> yādava-dāsa, vijaya-dāsa, dāsa janārdana
> ananta-dāsa, kānu-paṇḍita, dāsa nārāyaṇa

Yādava dāsa, Vijaya dāsa, Janārdana dāsa, Ananta dāsa, Kānu Paṇḍita and Nārāyaṇa dāsa were the nineteenth, twentieth, twenty-first, twenty-second, twenty-third and twenty-fourth branches of Advaita Ācārya.

/* TEXT 62 */

> puruṣottama brahmacārī, āra kṛṣṇadāsa

Śrīvatsa Paṇḍita, Haridāsa Brahmacārī, Puruṣottama Brahmacārī and Kṛṣṇadāsa were the twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth, twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth branches of Advaita Ācārya.

/* TEXT 63 */
> puruṣottama paṇḍita, āra raghunātha
> vanamālī kavicandra, āra vaidyanātha

Puruṣottama Paṇḍita, Raghunātha, Vanamālī Kavicandra and Vaidyanātha were the twenty-ninth, thirtieth, thirty-first and thirty-second branches of Advaita Ācārya.

/* TEXT 65 */
> vijaya paṇḍita, āra paṇḍita śrīrāma
> asaṅkhya advaita-śākhā kata la-iba nāma

Vijaya Paṇḍita and Śrīrāma Paṇḍita were two important branches of Advaita Ācārya. There are innumerable branches, but I am unable to mention them all.

/* TEXT 66 */
> māli-datta jala advaita-skandha yogāya
> sei jale jīye śākhā,---phula-phala pāya

The Advaita Ācārya branch received the water supplied by the original gardener, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In this way, the subbranches were nourished, and their fruits and flowers grew luxuriantly.

/* TEXT 67 */
> ihāra madhye mālī pāche kona śākhā-gaṇa
> nā māne caitanya-mālī durdaiva kāraṇa

After the disappearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, some of the branches, for unfortunate reasons, deviated from His path.

/* TEXT 68 */
> sṛjāila, jīyāila, tāṅre nā mānila
> kṛtaghna ha-ilā, tāṅre skandha kruddha ha-ila

Some branches did not accept the original trunk that vitalized and maintained the entire tree. When they thus became ungrateful, the original trunk was angry at them.

/* TEXT 69 */
> kruddha hañā skandha tāre jala nā sañcāre
> jalābhāve kṛśa śākhā śukāiyā mare

Thus Lord Caitanya did not sprinkle upon them the water of His mercy, and they gradually withered and died.

/* TEXT 70 */
> caitanya-rahita deha---śuṣkakāṣṭha-sama
> jīvitei mṛta sei, maile daṇḍe yama

A person without Kṛṣṇa consciousness is no better than dry wood or a dead body. He is understood to be dead while living, and after death he is punishable by Yamarāja.

/* TEXT 71 */
> kevala e gaṇa-prati nahe ei daṇḍa
> caitanya-vimukha yei sei ta’ pāṣaṇḍa

Not only the misguided descendants of Advaita Ācārya but anyone who is against the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu should be considered an atheist subject to be punished by Yamarāja.

/* TEXT 72 */
> ki paṇḍita, ki tapasvī, kibā gṛhī, yati
> caitanya-vimukha yei, tāra ei gati

Be he a learned scholar, a great ascetic, a successful householder or a famous sannyāsī, one who is against the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is destined to suffer the punishment meted out by Yamarāja.

/* TEXT 73 */
> ye ye laila śrī-acyutānandera mata
> sei ācāryera gaṇa---mahā-bhāgavata

The descendants of Advaita Ācārya who accepted the path of Śrī Acyutānanda were all great devotees.

/* TEXT 74 */
> sei sei,---ācāryera kṛpāra bhājana
> anāyāse pāila sei caitanya-caraṇa

By the mercy of Advaita Ācārya, the devotees who strictly followed the path of Caitanya Mahāprabhu attained the shelter of Lord Caitanya’s lotus feet without difficulty.

/* TEXT 75 */
> acyutera yei mata, sei mata sāra
> āra yata mata saba haila chārakhāra

It should be concluded, therefore, that the path of Acyutānanda is the essence of spiritual life. Those who did not follow this path simply scattered.

/* TEXT 76 */
> sei ācārya-gaṇe mora koṭi namaskāra
> acyutānanda-prāya, caitanya---jīvana yāṅhāra

I therefore offer my respectful obeisances millions of times to Acyutānanda’s actual followers, whose life and soul was Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

/* TEXT 77 */
> ei ta’ kahilāṅ ācārya-gosāñira gaṇa
> tina skandha-śākhāra kaila saṅkṣepa gaṇana

Thus I have briefly described the three branches [Acyutānanda, Kṛṣṇa Miśra and Gopāla] of Śrī Advaita Ācārya’s descendants.

/* TEXT 78 */
> śākhā-upaśākhā, tāra nāhika gaṇana
> kichu-mātra kahi’ kari dig-daraśana

There are multifarious branches and subbranches of Advaita Ācārya. It is very difficult to enumerate them fully. I have simply given a glimpse of the whole trunk and its branches and subbranches.

> śrī-gadādhara paṇḍita śākhāte mahottama
> tāṅra upaśākhā kichu kari ye gaṇana

After describing the branches and subbranches of Advaita Ācārya, I shall now attempt to describe some of the descendants of Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita, the most important among the branches.

The chief branches of Śrī Gadādhara Paṇḍita were (1) Śrī Dhruvānanda, (2) Śrīdhara Brahmacārī, (3) Haridāsa Brahmacārī and (4) Bhāgavata Ācārya.

The fifth branch was Ananta Ācārya; the sixth, Kavi Datta; the seventh, Nayana Miśra; the eighth, Gaṅgāmantrī; the ninth, Māmu Ṭhākura; and the tenth, Kaṇṭhābharaṇa.

/* TEXT 82 */
> bhūgarbha gosāñi, āra bhāgavata-dāsa
> yei dui āsi’ kaila vṛndāvane vāsa

The eleventh branch of Gadādhara Gosvāmī was Bhūgarbha Gosāñi, and the twelfth was Bhāgavata dāsa. Both of them went to Vṛndāvana and resided there for life.

> vallabha-caitanya-dāsa---kṛṣṇa-premamaya

The thirteenth branch was Vāṇīnātha Brahmacārī, and the fourteenth was Vallabha-caitanya dāsa. Both of these great personalities were always filled with love of Kṛṣṇa.
