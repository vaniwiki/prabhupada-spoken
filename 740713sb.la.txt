**Prabhupāda:**
Here mother earth, Dharitrī, "O Earth." Earth is being addressed. "The whole world is perturbed because the Kali-yuga has begun." Five thousand years ago, when the Kali-yuga began, so all persons were alarmed: "Now the Kali-yuga is begun. So many catastrophes will come in."

So one instruction is that the earth is addressed "//amba.//" //Amba// means mother. So the earth is also our mother. There are seven kinds of mother: //ādau-mātā guroḥ patnī.// Real mother, from whose womb we have taken birth, she is called //ādau-mātā,// first mother. Then second mother, the //guroḥ patnī. Guru// means teacher or spiritual master. His wife, she's also... Actually, according to strict moral instruction... Why strict? Ordinary. Any woman except his own wife is mother. Any woman. It doesn't matter whether she is elderly or young. No. That is the way. Still in India, any woman by unknown person, he can address any woman "Mother." The first relationship is mother. Now they have introduced "Sister," "//Bahinajī.//" No, that is not Vedic etiquette. No //bahinajī. Bahinajī// means sister. Mother. Everyone should be addressed. We should learn this. Except one's one wife, all women should be addressed as "Mother." This is civilization. Then there will be no corrupt relation. If you, from the very beginning, you establish your relationship with other women as mother, then there is no question of other relationship.

So here it is instructed. Even the earth is addressed as mother. According to //śāstra,// Dharitrī is one of the mothers, seven mothers.

> ādau-mātā guroḥ patnī
> brāhmaṇī rāja-patnikā
> dhenur dhātrī tathā pṛthvī
> saptaitā mātaraḥ smṛtāḥ
> [Nīti Śāstra]

There are seven kinds of mother. Real mother, then a spiritual master or teacher's wife, //guroḥ patnī. Brāhmaṇī,// the wife of a //brāhmaṇa. Ādau-mātā guroḥ patnī brāhmaṇī rāja-patnikā.// And the queen, the wife of the king. //Dhenu,// cow; //dhenur dhātrī,// maidservant, nurse. Because it was also formerly the practice, rich man; or mother is not..., unable to suck breast milk. So they used to employ young girls who has also children, otherwise there is no milk supplied. So that is also mother. As Kṛṣṇa took Pūtanā as mother... Pūtanā came to kill Kṛṣṇa, smearing poison over her breast. And Kṛṣṇa sucked the milk and her life also. But Kṛṣṇa took her as her [His] mother. This is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa did not take the black side. The intention was to kill Kṛṣṇa, Pūtanā came. But who can kill Kṛṣṇa? That is not possible. But Kṛṣṇa thought Himself as obligation, that "I have sucked her breast. So she is My mother. She must be given the position of mother." So Pūtanā, after being killed, she was given the same opportunity as Mother Yaśodā. This is Kṛṣṇa. //Bhāva-grāhī-janārdanaḥ.// Any way you serve Kṛṣṇa, it will be accepted. Not any way; I mean to say, we should serve Kṛṣṇa according to regulative principle. Still, some way or other, unknowing or knowingly, if you render some service, that is called //ajñāta-sukṛti.//

//Ajñāta// means without your knowledge you are advancing in spiritual life. That is called //ajñāta-sukṛti.// You do not know. But the system is so nice... Just like our this class is going on. These children, they are dancing, they are offering obeisances, they are offering a flower. They do not know what they are doing, but it will not go in vain. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These things are becoming assets, one after another. Just like if you keep money in the bank, daily you save, it is increasing your bank balance; similarly, these children, although they do not know what is this class, what is Prabhupāda speaking, why we are offering... They are imitating. They are imitating, offering obeisances. We used to do so. Every children, every child does so. So if the mother is a devotee, the child automatically becomes a devotee, without any effort. If the father, mother is devotee... Therefore //śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sanjāyate// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. Kṛṣṇa says that those who are //yoga-bhraṣṭaḥ,// could not fulfill the whole program of devotional service, some way or other fallen down, so they are given chance, another chance. What is that chance? The chance is he is given a human form of life and born in a devotee's house, so that from the very beginning of life he will again be in connection with devotional service. So these children, they are not ordinary children. Formerly, they were also devotees, somehow or other, could not fulfill the whole program. Now Kṛṣṇa has given the chance to take birth in the womb of a devotee mother so that from the very beginning of life they're learning devotional service. So the mother, father also should be careful, that "They are Vaiṣṇavas, they have come under my care. So that he may not be spoiled, let him become a perfect Vaiṣṇava, and his life become perfect." This is... This is very nice program.

So Mother Dharitrī... Dharitrī is mother. So he's asking whether mother is lamenting because Kṛṣṇa... //Bhūri-bharāvatāra-kṛtāvatārasya hareḥ.// After the Battle of Kurukṣetra, Kṛṣṇa disappeared from this earth. Kṛṣṇa went back to His abode. So Kṛṣṇa comes here, as it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. So Kṛṣṇa appeared to kill so many demons at that time. Whenever there will be demons, Kṛṣṇa will come. At the present moment, now, the world is full of demons. Therefore Kṛṣṇa has come in the form of Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Kṛṣṇa //avatāra. Kali-yuge nāma-rūpe avatāra.// So don't think that Kṛṣṇa, this vibration "Kṛṣṇa," is different from that Kṛṣṇa. The same Kṛṣṇa. The same Kṛṣṇa. If you say that "Why He does not come to kill the demons?" that is His great sympathy, mercy, that you are already killed. You see? What another killing? So we are already dead. Therefore we are so fallen that it does not require any more killing. Mercifulness. You see? The demons... Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa, merciful. //Pāpī tāpī jata chilo hari-nāme uddhārilo.// All the demons, full of sinful activities, they are to be delivered by this weapon, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, killing is going on.

So it is now sympathy. Therefore when Jagāi-Mādhāi insulted Nityānanda, immediately Caitanya Mahāprabhu came and wanted to kill them. Nityānanda Prabhu reminded, "Sir, You have promised in this Your incarnation will not kill." So then He was satisfied and delivered the demons. Delivered the demons. Nityānanda Prabhu is therefore so kind. Nityānanda Prabhu is //guru.// He's so kind that in spite of being injured by Jagāi-Mādhāi, He delivered them. He requested Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. There was two section. One section, //sādhu,// and one section, demon. That was the idea. Even when Kṛṣṇa appeared, there were two section. Now everyone is demon. Then if the killing program is taken, then [Hindi], then everything will be finished. Therefore there is no killing program by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is killing program---it is killing the sinful activities. //Pāpī tāpī jata chilo hari-nāme uddhārilo.// Simply by chanting. He'll not be killed, but his activities, sinful activities, will be killed. This is the program.

So the mother earth was lamenting, "Now Kṛṣṇa has gone. Who will give us protection?" But Kṛṣṇa gives protection. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca...// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. Two, two different duties: to give protection to the //sādhus,// to the devotees, and to kill the demons. So... Another word is used: //antarhitasya smaratī visṛṣṭā karmāṇi nirvāṇa-vilambitāni. Nirvāṇa-karma.// This is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Try to understand seriously. We are here in this life, human form of life. We should not be lazy. Laziness is not required. //Karmāṇi.// We should be active. What for? Now, //nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa// means finishing this material life. That is called //nirvāṇa.// The Buddha philosophy, they take it //nirvāṇa.// Their philosophy is //nirvāṇa,// means to stop the feelings of pains and pleasure. So their philosophy is that the pains and pleasure... Not only their philosophy; we also know. //Bhagavad-gītā// also says. //Mātrā-sparśās tu śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]. The, the worldly pains and pleasure---what is due to? It is due to this material body. //Mātrā-sparśāḥ. Mātrā// means the skin. Because we have got this skin, in winter, the water is there, we feel pain, pinching. And because it is summer, the same water---pleasing. So the condition of the skin, according to the season, is changing. Therefore we are feeling pains and pleasure. Otherwise there is no pain, pleasure. Just try to understand. Because we are covered by the skin, therefore we are feeling pains and pleasure. If you become uncovered, free from the skinly covering, then there is no pains and pleasure.

So that is our main business, how to get out of this material body of skins and bones. That is real business. But these rascals, they do not know what is real business. They want to maintain the skin and bone by another skin and bone. That is their program. So it is foolish civilization. They do not know what is civilization, what is the aim of life, what we should do. Nothing, no program. Simply just like animals, and kill animals and eat and be merry. And to digest meat, you drink also. One after another. As soon as there is drinking, then there is illicit sex. And so many things complicated. Therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// warns, //yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. You must work. You should not be idle. But //yajñārthe:// for Kṛṣṇa. Then you'll not be implicated. Otherwise, you'll be implicated. By the grace of //māyā,// you'll be so implicated that you have got this human form of life, and after giving up this body, you'll have to accept, according to your //karma,// one of the 8,400,000 species of life; maybe it may be a tree, it may be a cat, it may be a dog, or it may be something lower grade.

Because in this age our activities are all sinful, lower grade. Therefore you cannot expect higher-grade life. That is not possible. Higher-grade life you can get. You can go in the higher planetary systems. You can get long duration of life, better comforts, better nice body. There are arrangement. Svargaloka. //Bhūr bhuva... Oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi...// This is //gāyatrī.// There are three //lokas: bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ.// So //svaḥ,// heavenly, they've no some information, there is heavenly planet. Actually there is. There are... Svargaloka is not so very comfortable. Above the Svargaloka there is Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka, Brahmaloka, like that, seven //lokas.// So who will go there? //Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ// [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]. If you are situated in the modes of goodness, then you can be promoted to the higher planetary system. And //madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ,// and if you are in the modes of passion, then you'll remain within this //bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ,// three worlds. And //jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ,// and if you are simply in darkness, you do not know how to enjoy spiritual life or material life, just like cats and dogs, then you'll have to be degraded. You take the body of trees, plants, lower animals, insect, worms of the stool, and so many things. So one should know that.

So //nirvāṇa.// Actually, there is no benefit. Even if I go to the highest planetary system, with very, very long duration of life and material comfort, that is not actual benefit. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]: "My dear Arjuna, even if you are promoted to the Brahmaloka, the highest planetary system, still, it is not safe, because the death is there. And if you come to My place, no, there is no more..." That is called //nirvāṇa.// Our business is to finish this material existence and go back to home, back to... That is real business.

So here the Dharmarāja is lamenting, "On account of absence of Kṛṣṇa, our real business, //nirvāṇa,// is being delayed. Therefore, are you lamenting, mother?" So Kṛṣṇa is so kind that although He's not present at the present moment, still, in the form of His holy name He's present. You can take still advantage of Kṛṣṇa's name by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// You can take. Don't think that when you chant "Kṛṣṇa," this name Kṛṣṇa is different from the Kṛṣṇa person. No. They are the same.

> nāma cintāmaṇiḥ kṛṣṇaś
> caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ
> pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-mukto
> 'bhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:133|[Cc. Madhya 17.133]]]

This is the //śāstric// injunction. //Abhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ. Nāma,// the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa, they're not different. //Abhinna. Abhinna// means not separate; the same. So take advantage of this life, and take advantage of this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// and make your life successful.

Thank you very much.
