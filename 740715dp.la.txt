**Devotee:**
[leading] ...Śrīla Prabhupāda //ki jaya!// His Divine Loving Grace Śrīla Prabhupāda //ki jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
[leads //prema-dhvani// prayers] Thank you very much. [devotees offer obeisances] [aside:] How much time? Time?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Eight-fifteen, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Eight-fifteen.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, what time we have to start?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Well, we should leave for the airport by quarter past, half past...

**Prabhupāda:**
Now we have got half an hour time?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

[01:48]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [leads singing of //Jaya Rādhā-Mādhava//] [//prema-dhvani//]

Thank you very much. [break]

[05:36]

So, you are engaged in the service of Śrī Rādhā-Mādhava. He's present here. And I am very glad that you are doing very nice. Keep the standard. This Deity worship and chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra...// Be always engaged in this business. It is a very important business. Kṛṣṇa says that //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru, mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]. Our mission is to go back to home, back to Godhead. So it is not very difficult thing. Very easy. But we do not want it. That is the difficulty. Otherwise, the matter is very simple. Kṛṣṇa says four things, that "Always think of Me..." Now, here is Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī, Kṛṣṇa, standing before you. Don't think that this is idol. No. Kṛṣṇa is present before you in that form to show you favor that you can handle with Kṛṣṇa. You can dress Him. You can give Him for eating. You can... To give you facilities. But Kṛṣṇa is here, and Rādhārāṇī is here.

So He says, personally, that //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto:// "Always think of Me." So you are seeing Kṛṣṇa, and the impression is within your mind. As soon as you will close your eyes, you will see Kṛṣṇa within your heart. Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī is here, and if you see constantly, naturally the impression will be within your heart. So either you are in temple or outside the temple, you'll be able to see Kṛṣṇa always---if you practice. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu// [Bs. 5.38]. Those who are saintly person, on account of love for Kṛṣṇa they see always Kṛṣṇa within his heart. So this practice is not very difficult. It doesn't require M.A., Ph.D. education, or to become very rich or opulent. Nothing is required. Simply try to think of Kṛṣṇa, that's all. This is one item. It is not very difficult. And become His devotee. That you are practicing. Devotee means to hear about Kṛṣṇa, to chant the glories of Kṛṣṇa, to think of Kṛṣṇa, to offer fruits and flowers to Kṛṣṇa. In this way, this is called devotional service.

So to think of Kṛṣṇa and to become devotee of Kṛṣṇa is not at all difficult task. Then... //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī:// "Worship Me." So here is the chance for worshiping Kṛṣṇa. //Ārā..., bhoga-ārātrika.// Temple. Keep the temple very cleansed. Dress Kṛṣṇa daily. You also dress nicely, take your bath, be pure. So //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]: "And just offer obeisances to Me." Even the child can do. They are doing it. It is not at all difficult. But simply by executing these four principles, Kṛṣṇa says, gives assurance, //mām evaiṣyasi:// "You come to Me."

So our program is how to go back to home, back to Godhead, and the program is very simple. Some way or other, we have introduced this program in the Western countries, and you are so intelligent, you have very soon captured it. So stick to the standard; then your life is successful. It is not at all difficult. But don't deviate. Then you are //pakkā.// Yes. //Pakkā// means solid. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. If you remain solid in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the //māyā// cannot touch you. So that is my request.

So I am traveling all over the world. I am going to see how things are going in Dallas or New Vrindaban and another... So my touring is natural. I have started this movement. I want to see that it is going on nicely.

So you kindly help me. Don't deviate. That is my only request. [voice breaking] Then you will remain solid.

Thank you very much.
