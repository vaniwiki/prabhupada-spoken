====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.2.20 ======

**Nitāi:**
[leads chanting of verse] [devotees repeat]

[break]

"Thus established in the mode of goodness, the man rejuvenated by loving service to the Lord gains liberation from material association, mukti, and comes to know scientifically of the Personality of Godhead."

**Prabhupāda:**

> evaṁ prasanna-manaso
> bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ
> bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ
> mukta-saṅgasya jāyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]

//Bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ.// It is not sentiment; it is //vijñāna. Vijñāna// means science. To become a devotee does not mean a sentimentalist. Sentimentalist has no value. One who had... There is sentiment. That is emotional sentiment in the... Just like this child is dancing. It is not sentiment---he has no sentiment---but he is dancing from the spiritual awakening. This dancing is not dog’s dancing. This is... One who is feeling love of Godhead, he is dancing. The more one feels love of Godhead, he can dance, he can chant, he can cry. There are so many..., eight kinds of //aṣṭa-sāttvika-vikāra// [[books:cc:antya:14:99|[Cc. Antya 14.99]]]: transformation of the body, tears in the eyes.

So //bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ.//

> jñānaṁ parama-guhyaṁ me
> yad vijñāna-samanvitam
> [[books:sb:2:9:31|[SB 2.9.31]]]

Kṛṣṇa said to Brahmā, //jñānaṁ me parama-guhyaṁ.// To know about Kṛṣṇa, it is very, very confidential. It is not ordinary thing. //Vijñāna.// Therefore many scientists, they are also joining our movement. Many Doctor of Philosophy, Chemistry, they are understanding this is a science, and the more you make propaganda, I mean, the higher circle of the society, the learned scholars, professors, scientists, philosophers, they will join. And for them we have got so many books. We have proposal to publish eighty books. Out of them, we have published about fourteen books.

So it is a science. Otherwise, why //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// has devoted eighteen thousand verses for understanding? Hmm? In the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]], that cheating, sentimentalism, the so-called religious system, is //projjhita,// is kicked out. There is no such place here in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Projjhita.// Just like you brush something with broomstick or something and throw away the dust, similarly, the dusty things, so-called sentimental religionism, is not here in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// It is a science. //Parama-guhyaṁ:// very confidential. To understand Kṛṣṇa is not ordinary thing. Kṛṣṇa says,

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

So this truth is understandable through the..., through Kṛṣṇa or through Kṛṣṇa’s representative. In //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa says,

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

//Mad-āśrayaḥ. Mad-āśrayaḥ// means "Under My..., under Me." Actually it means, //mad-āśrayaḥ// means, one who has taken the shelter of Kṛṣṇa, or one who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa without any reservation. He is called //mad-āśrayaḥ,// or one who has taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa perfectly. So this //yoga,// this //bhakti-yoga,// as it is stated here, //bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ,// so //bhagavad-bhakti-yoga// can be learned when one takes fully shelter at the lotus feet of a //bhagavad-bhakta.// That is called //bhagavad-bhakta.// You, you cannot become //bhagavad-bhakta// independent, without caring for your spiritual master. That is nonsense. That is rascaldom. He will never be able.

We are singing daily, //yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo.// But you do not know the meaning, unfortunately. //Yasya prasādād:// if the spiritual master is pleased, then Bhagavān is pleased; not that independently. //Yasya..., yasya prasādād.// In the ten kinds of offenses, the first offense is //guror avajñā// [//Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Khaṇḍa// 25.15–18], disobeying the orders of //guru.// And especially //guru’s// business is to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And if a person blasphemes a person who is preaching all over the world Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is the greatest offense. But we are reading ten kinds of offenses, //gurvaṣṭaka,// and the //guru’s...// Do you know the meaning, what is that, //śrī-guru-carana-padma?// What is that song? Read it.

**Devotee:**
//Śrī-guru-carana-padma, kevala bhakati-sadma...//

**Prabhupada:**
Ahh.

**Devotee:**
//Bando mui sāvadhāna...//

**Prabhupada:**
Ah, //sāvadhāna mate,// "with great care." You sing this song---do you know the meanings? No. Who can explain the meaning? Yes, you explain.

**Devotee:**
//Śrī-guru-carana-padma// means "the lotus feet of the //guru.//" //Kevala bhakati-sadma,// that he is a reservoir of all devotion, or //bhakti. Bando mui sāvadhāna// means that we worship him with great awe.

**Prabhupada:**
Hmm. Read. Read the other lines.

**Devotee:**
//Jāhāra prasāde bhāi...//

**Prabhupada:**
Ah, //jāhāra prasāde bhāi.// Then?

**Devotee:**
//E bha va toriyā jāi.//

**Prabhupada:**
//E bha va toriyā jāi.// If one is, I mean to say, favored by //guru,// then the path to cross over the nescience is clear. //Jāhāra prasāde bhāi, e bha va toriyā jāi.// Then, next line.

**Devotee:**
//Kṛṣṇa-prāpti hoy jāhā hāte.//

**Prabhupada:**
And //krṣṇa-prāpti hoy jāhā hate:// by the favor of //guru// one gets Kṛṣṇa. This is the... //Yasya prasādād bhagavat.// Everywhere. This is //bhagavad-bhakti-yoga.// So one who has not attained this state, what is this //bhagavad-bhakti?// This is rascaldom. That is not //bhagavad...//

> evaṁ prasanna-manaso
> bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ
> [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]

//Bhagavad-bhakti---yoga.// It is a kind of //yoga,// or the real //yoga.// Topmost //yoga// system is //bhagavad-bhakti,// and //bhagavad-bhakti-yoga// begins, //ādau gurv-āśrayaḥ.// First of all surrender to //guru.//

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

The official initiation has no meaning. Unless one who has fully surrendered to //guru,// there is no question of initiation. //Divya jñāna hṛde prokāśito. Divya-jñāna// means "transcendental knowledge." So to play tricks with //guru,// to become diplomat and intriguer, these rascaldom will not help //bhagavad-bhakti-yoga.// You can get some other things, some material profit, but spiritual life will be spoiled.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for spiritual enlightenment, not for how to get money, how to earn money. This is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Caitanya Mahāprabhu teaches,

> na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ
> kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye
> [Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]

//Na dhanaṁ.// The materialists, they, what they want? They want money. They want many followers and many subordinates, or nice, beautiful wife. This is materialist. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu refuses. //Na dhanaṁ:// "No, no. I don’t want money." This is teaching. //Na dhanaṁna janaṁ:// "I don’t want to rule over somebody." No. //Na..., na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ;// a poetic imagination of nice, beautiful wife. "These things I do not want." What is? Then, //bhagavad-bhakti-yoga,//

> mama janmani janmanīśvare
> bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi
> [Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]

Then //bhagavad-bhakta// do not want even liberation. Why Kṛṣṇa..., Caitanya Mahāprabhu is saying //janmani janmani,// "birth after..."? One who is liberated, he does not take any more birth in this material world. Those who are impersonalist, they merge into the effulgence, bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa, and those who are devotees, they get permission to enter into Vaikuṇṭha, or Goloka Vṛndāvana. [aside:] Don't make [indistinct].

So if we want //prasanna mana,// always jubilation---that is spiritual life. Not that always morose, making some plans. That is not spiritual life. You don’t find any materialistic person jubilant. He is morose, and thinking, and smoking cigarette and drinking, making some big, big plan. That is materialist. And //bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ: prasanna-manaso.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

//Prasannātmā.// This is spiritual life. As soon as you become actually in spiritual life---never mind either you in impersonal philosophy or personal philosophy, both of them are spiritualist; only the difference is the impersonalists think that "I am spirit; God is spirit. Therefore we one. We merge into this." //Sāyujya-mukti.// Kṛṣṇa gives them //sāyujya-mukti.// But that is not very safe, because //ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. //Ānanda,// real //ānanda,// cannot be realized oneself. There must be two. Love does not mean "I love myself" and meditate upon love. No. There must..., must be another person, lover. Therefore //dvaitavāda.// As soon as you come to the //bhakti// school, there must be //dvaitavāda:// two---Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s devotee. And the exchange of Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa’s servant is called //bhakti.// The dealings, that is called //bhakti.// Therefore it is said, //bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ.// Not monism, oneness. There is always the //bhakta,// devotee, is trying to please Kṛṣṇa. They, just like //gopīs,// the topmost devotees, their only business is to please Kṛṣṇa. That’s all.

Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended, //ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā// [Caitanya-manjusa]. There cannot be better method of worship than the process which the //gopīs// adopted. They did not care for anything. The //gopīs,// some of them were engaged in household affairs, somebody was talking with husband, some of them taking care of the children, some, some of them were boiling milk. As soon as there was Kṛṣṇa’s flute, everything left undone. "Where you are going?" Husband, brother, father: "Where you are going?" "No, don’t care. Kṛṣṇa’s flute is there; we do not know anything." This is devotion, the highest, topmost. Caitanya Mahāprabhu..., Caitanya Mahāprabhu was so strict that a woman could not come very near to offer him obeisances. From little distance. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as a //sannyāsī,// He was so strict. Of course, that should be the principle, but especially in your country, that cannot be very strictly observed. But at least one should be very careful. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu was so strict---He’s eulogizing the //gopīs’// love of Kṛṣṇa.

So that //gopīs’// love is not ordinary thing, this. It is transcendental. Otherwise, how Caitanya Mahāprabhu appreciates? How Śukadeva Gosvāmī appreciated //kṛṣṇa-līlā?// This //kṛṣṇa-līlā// is not ordinary thing. It is spiritual. So unless one is situated firmly in //bhakti-yoga,// they should not try to understand what is the pastimes of the //gopīs// with Kṛṣṇa. That will be dangerous. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, he says,

> rūpa-raghunātha-pade hoibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhabo se jugala-pīriti
> [Lālasāmayī Prārthanā 4]

//Jugala-pīriti:// the loving dealings between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. //Jugala, jugala// means "couple"; //pīriti// means "love." So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, exalted //ācārya,// he said, "When I shall be able to understand?" Not that "I have understood everything." Not "I have understood everything." This is nice. This is //vijñānaṁ, bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ.// So we should be very careful to understand the science. And the science can be understood through the mercy of the spiritual master. Therefore Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says, //yasya prasādād:// first of all try to please your spiritual master. Then try to understand.

So it is a great science.

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

This is the process. First of all surrender yourself: "Sir, I’ll surrender you." "All right." "Now I don’t like it." What is this? What is this surrender, "Now I don’t like it"? That means there was no surrender. Surrender does not mean, "Now I surrender, and if you do not please me, if you do not satisfy my senses, then I don’t like." That is not surrender. Surrender, the example is given by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura: dog. Very good example. The dog surrenders to the master fully. Even the master kills him, he does not protest. This is example.

> vaiṣṇava ṭhākura, tomāra kukkura
> bhuliyā jānaha more

"//Vaiṣṇava ṭhākura,// my dear, my revered spiritual master, you are the best of the Vaiṣṇavas. Please accept me as your dog." That is surrender.

So real surrender begins,

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

//Āśrayah. Āśraya loiyā bhaje kṛṣṇa tāre nāhi tyāje// [Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura]. One who executes devotional service, taking shelter of bona fide spiritual master, Kṛṣṇa will never give him up. He will accept him. //Āśraya loiyā bhaje kṛṣṇa tāre nāhi tyāge āra saba more akaraṇa//[?]. Others, they will simply waste their time, that’s all. So this is //bhagavad-bhakti-yoga. Ādau gurv-āśrayaṁ sad-dharma-pṛcchā, sādhu-mārga-anugamanam// [Brs. 1.1.74]. Everything is there in the devotional service, in //The Nectar of Devotion, Teachings of Lord Caitanya, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā// we are publishing. If you do not understand, if you think that "These books are for sale, and we are all learned. We have learned everything. Finished. Our business is finished," that will not improve the condition. 

> evaṁ prasanna-manaso
> bhagavad-bhakti-yoga
> bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ
> [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]

It is a science. As you learn science... Just like our Svarūpa Dāmodara, Doctor---so he is now Doctor. We have got another Doctor in New Vrindaban; he is also scientist. So if you want to take the doctorate title, that is also the surrender. There are committees, three-, four-men committees. When they certify, "Yes. This is all right. This thesis presented by such and such, it is approved," then you get. So everywhere there is //tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. So if we are not serious about understanding the science of Kṛṣṇa, if you take some opportunity to become this, to become that, and make some money, and this and that, then the whole thing is finished. For opportunists there is no Kṛṣṇa consciousness. For the real surrendered soul: //mad-āśrayaḥ.//

So //bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ.// Everyone, we are at least here enlisted ourself to become a graduate in //bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ.// This is the process. //Mad-āśrayaḥ,// Kṛṣṇa says. //Mad-āśrayaḥ// means //yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// To become under Kṛṣṇa or... That is not possible, because without taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa’s servant, //gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80, Padyāvalī 74]]]... We have to become servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa. Not aspiring, "I shall become directly servant of Kṛṣṇa." That is Māyāvāda. Our process is the servant of the... Caitanya Mahāprabhu teaches, the servant of the... The more one has become servant of the hundredth generation down, he is perfect.

So try to understand.

> bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ
> mukta-saṅgasya jāyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]

//Bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ.// This science, who can understand? //Mukta-saṅgasya. Mukta// means "liberated," and //saṅga// means "association." So association means we are always... We are contaminated by the material nature. Sometimes we are good; sometimes we are passionate; sometimes we are rascal. There are three //gunas.// Some of them are very good, and some of them are passionate and some of them are rascals. So we have to transcend even the platform of so-called goodness. That is called //mukta-saṅga.// Because in the material life, we are always associating with these //gunas,// three qualities, //guna-mayī, māyā. Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī. Guna-mayī. Guna,// these three //gunas.// So it is very difficult. Sometimes we are in the platform of goodness, then we fall down in the passion, then we fall down in ignorance. Or from ignorance I rise again in goodness and again fall down. This is going on. But therefore you have to become //mukta-saṅgasya,// above all these qualities. Above all. "I am very good man. I am good manager. I am this...," you have to surpass that also. That is called //mukta-saṅgasya.//

But that //mukta-saṅgasya// is possible when we are sincerely engaged in devotional service. Just like the Deity worship. The Deity worship means gradually to become //mukta-saṅga.// Therefore Deity worship is essential. There is process: You must all rise early in the morning; you must take bath; you should offer //maṅgala-ārati.// Then after that, after that dressing, some flowering. In this way, if you always remain, then gradually you will become //mukta-saṅga.// [indistinct] The tongue..., as soon as you begin and devotional service that is the stage of //mukta-saṅga.// If you do not fall down, if we strictly follow the instruction of spiritual master and the //śāstra// and be engaged always in devotional service there is no question of fall down. That is called //mukta-saṅga.// But if you deviate, if you do not like, then you will fall down. So when you become //mukta-saṅga, mukta-saṅga// begins the change is there, if you follow. If you don't follow then you'll fall down. But if you remain on the platform then we should be able to understand, ...what is that?, //bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ.// The abosolute Truth about the supreme lord.

So I am very pleased that we are doing nicely and travelling I have seen at temples, so don't deviate. Don't deviate from the instruction given by your spiritual master, make that your life and soul, and follow the regulative principles chant 16 rounds you'll never fall down. //Mukta-saṅga.// Then gradually Kṛṣṇa will be revealed. //Bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ.// Thank you very much.
