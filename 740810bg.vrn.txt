**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ
> khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca
> ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me
> bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā
> [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]

[break] [01:54]

Translation: "Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego---altogether these eight comprise My separated material energies."

**Prabhupāda:**
So,

> bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ
> khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca
> ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me
> bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā
> [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]

//Bhinnā// means separated. Separated means... Kṛṣṇa explains in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. As it is confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,//

> eko 'py asau racayituṁ jagad-aṇḍa-koṭiṁ
> yac-chaktir asti jagad-aṇḍa-cayā yad-antaḥ
> aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.35]

Kṛṣṇa, by His one plenary portion... When we say of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is not alone. Kṛṣṇa has unlimited expansions. Just like one expansion is Paramātmā. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Kṛṣṇa expands Himself. There are millions and trillions of living entities. //Anantyāya kalpate.// The living entities... //Sa ca anantyāya kalpate.// So Kṛṣṇa's expansion is also //ananta.// Not only within the heart of all living entities, but He is within the atom also. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara.// But this is only one plenary portion, expansion of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore in the morning we were studying---or yesterday---that to understand Kṛṣṇa philosophically or in truth, it requires a little intelligence. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye, yatatām api siddhānām// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]].

So Kṛṣṇa expands by His energy, one of the energy, external energy. Therefore it is called //aparā.// Kṛṣṇa will explain in the next verse, //apareyam,// inferior energy. For Kṛṣṇa there is no superior or inferior, but for us it is superior and inferior. Because Kṛṣṇa is the supreme spirit soul. Take, for example, just like electricity is producing heat and cool also. There is refrigerator. That is being worked out by the electric energy. And the heater is also being worked out by the electric energy. So we may distinguish this, that "This is heat and this is cold." But for Kṛṣṇa there is no such distinction. That will be understood by further explanation of this chapter.

So these energies, the external energy, Kṛṣṇa says they are separated. "Separated" means you cannot perceive Kṛṣṇa directly from this energy. All materialistic scientists, they cannot understand that earth is also Kṛṣṇa's energy, water is also Kṛṣṇa's energy, fire is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. But they are energy, that they can understand. They are accepting... The scientists, they are accepting that these are different energies. But whose energy, that they do not know. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is explaining herewith that "It is My energy, separated energy." If we analytically study how water can be energy of Kṛṣṇa... We should study Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's energies very intelligently. Wherefrom this vast water of ocean came into existence? But we can understand from //Bhagavad-gītā// that this vast water has come from Kṛṣṇa's energy. Now, try to understand how Kṛṣṇa's energy can produce so large amount of water. So far I am concerned, I study in this way, that we produce perspiration from our body. That perspiration may be one ounce of water, but that is produced from my body. But Kṛṣṇa has got inconceivable energy. I have got also inconceivable energy. How the water is coming out, I do not know. It is inconceivable. But it is coming out. That's a fact. So I am a very small, teeny living entity. If I can produce... Because I am always limited, therefore my energy is also limited. But Kṛṣṇa is unlimited, so He can produce water from the perspiration of His body unlimitedly. We have to understand like that. Otherwise, it is not possible to understand how //āpaḥ,// water, came from the energy of Kṛṣṇa. It is coming from the living entity. Water is not coming from matter. Just like your perspiration is not coming... When the body is dead, the water is not coming, but so long you are living, the perspiration is there.

Therefore the source of all material elements is originally the supreme life, not matter. That is explained here: //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. But they are separated. How they are separated? That is explained in a different verse.

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> nāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]

It is separated because in this material world you cannot directly perceive the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Nāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ:// "I am not present there. Although it is coming from My energy, still, I am not present there." This is simultaneously-one-and-different philosophy.

So Kṛṣṇa says that //ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭa...// Everything is finer. Just like the earth is grosser than the water. Water, finer. Earth you cannot move, but water can move; therefore it is finer. And finer than the earth is the fire, and finer than the fire is air, and finer than the air is ether, and finer than the ether is the mind, and finer than the mind is intelligence, and finer than intelligence is my identity, //ahaṅkāra.// And finer than the //ahaṅkāra// is the soul. You have to study soul---finer, finer, finer, finer, finer. It is also stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā// in another place that //indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ, manasas tu parā buddhiḥ...// [[books:bg:3:42|[Bg. 3.42]]]. In this way, finer, finer. And the soul is very small magnitude fine. //Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya ca// [//Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// 5.9]. So everything is explained in the //Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā.// If we accept, then we get full knowledge. The beginning of the //Bhagavad-gītā...// In this chapter, Kṛṣṇa says, //asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]: "Without any doubt and in full, as you can understand Me, I am going to explain."

So these five elements, gross elements, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ kham..., kham.// And finer than, //manaḥ, buddhiḥ, ahaṅkāraḥ,// mind, intelligence and false ego. False ego means I am identifying with this matter, which I am not. Therefore //ahaṅkāra.// This //ahaṅkāra// is false //ahaṅkāra,// which I am not. I am accepting that I am this body, but actually I am not. Therefore I am saying it is false ego. Real //ahaṅkāra// is //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// There is also //ahaṅkāra. Ahaṅkāra// cannot be abolished. //Ahaṅkāra// will be there, but //ahaṅkāra// has to be cleansed. Therefore //bhakti-mārga,// the path of //bhakti-yoga,// is the cleansing process, clearing process. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. Everything is there, but it has to be cleansed. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. By chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// you'll be able to cleanse your misconception of life. Misconception of life is that "I am this matter." This is //ahaṅkāra,// false //ahaṅkāra.// But I am actually not this matter; I am spirit soul. Therefore pure //ahaṅkāra// is //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// a spirit soul. That is the beginning of understanding. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// that is also explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. If one understands this fact, that "I am not this material body; I am a spirit soul," that is called //brahma-bhūta.//

So gradually, by understanding the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā// and practicing it in life, we shall very easily understand the //ātma-tattvam.// That is the real business of human life. Unfortunately, we are not interested in the matter of understanding //ātma-tattvam. Śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, "My dear King..." He was speaking to Mahārāja Parīkṣit that "For ordinary men there are many subject matter of hearing." //Śrotavyādīni. Śrotavya// means the subject matter for hearing. So Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, "For the ordinary man..." Who is that ordinary man? //Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. //Apaśyatām:// one who has no interest to see what he is. Everyone is under this contemplation that he is this body and his bodily interest is the prime interest. But nobody sees the //ātma-tattvam.// Therefore Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, //śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ.// We have got so many books, so many newspapers, so many magazines, we hear and read. But we are not interested in hearing //Bhagavad-gītā// or //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// where //ātma-tattvam,// the science of soul, is described.

So why they are not interested? Now, //apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām. Gṛheṣu,// the household life, they are thinking, "This is life." //Tātala saikate vāri-bindu-sama, suta-mita-ramaṇī-samāje.// Vidyāpati, a great poet, Vaiṣṇava poet, he has sung that... We are happy within this material world. How? //Suta-mita-ramaṇī-samāje. Suta. Suta// means children, and //mita// means friends and //ramaṇī// means woman. So actually, our material life, existing, is society, friendship and love. If there are nice, beautiful woman at home, children and friends, we are taking, "This is our life." But that is not life. Real life is to understand what I am, //ātma-tattvam. Ātma-tattvam.// Without understanding //ātma-tattvam,// the life is failure. Therefore Vidyāpati sings, //tātala saikate vāri-bindu-sama, suta-mita-ramaṇī-samāje.// We have created this society, friendship and love in this material world for becoming happy. Everyone wants to be happy, because that is his natural inclination. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. As Kṛṣṇa is happy always... You will see, Kṛṣṇa is enjoying His life with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and the //gopīs// or the cowherds boys or His father, mother. That is spiritual, everything. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. That is //ānanda-cinmaya.// A similar imitation here in this material world, the same thing, //suta-mita-ramaṇī-samāje.// But it is false. Just like you see water in the desert. You'll see there is vast mass of water in the desert, and the animal falsely go to drink the water and dies. Similarly, in this material world, this //suta-mita-ramaṇī-samāje,// what we are trying to become happy, that is like will-o'-the wisp, false thing.

Real life is in the society of Kṛṣṇa. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura therefore says, //kṛṣṇera saṁsāra kara chāḍi' anācāra.// If you enter into the society, friendship and love of Kṛṣṇa, that is perfection of life. Not in this false, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. They are separated energy. This is also made by the Kṛṣṇa's energies, but it is separate, reflection, false representa... //Chāyeva. Chāyeva// means just like shadow. Just like you see your face in the mirror, but it is not actually the face; it is simply... The face is here, and the shadow is there. Similarly, this material world, made of //bhūmir āpo analo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhiḥ,// they are just like reflection of the real life in the spiritual world. Therefore it is called separated energy. Why Kṛṣṇa says? Kṛṣṇa says here that //bhinnā. Bhinnā// means separated. The example I have already..., sometimes I give. Just like I speak in the tape recorder. When you play, replay the tape recorder, the same voice will come. But that is not myself. That is my separated energy. With my energy I have spoken something, I have vibrated some sound. That is recorded in the tape. When it is played back, it produces exactly the same sound, but still, it is separated from me. Try to understand. This material world is like that, //bhinnā,// separate. The real life is in the spiritual world. The real life is... Therefore in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, //satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]: "The real truth, the Absolute Truth, I am offering my obeisances to the Absolute Truth." So Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Truth. Kṛṣṇa is explaining Himself. If we want to understand Kṛṣṇa, then, instead of speculating about Kṛṣṇa, better take what Kṛṣṇa teaching Himself. That will be perfect.

So the real understanding of Kṛṣṇa: that this material world is also Kṛṣṇa. But we do not know how to use it for Kṛṣṇa. If we take to that process... Kṛṣṇa's energy should be for Kṛṣṇa's purpose. That is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. Vaiṣṇava philosophy never says that this world is false. Why it is false? It is not false. As the Māyāvādī philosopher says that //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā...// No. Why //jagan mithyā?// Just like this temple is constructed. If somebody says, "Yes, it is very nicely constructed, but it is all false," shall I be happy? No. And actually, why it is false? It is not false; it is Kṛṣṇa's energy, the //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ.// What is this temple? This temple is combination of this //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. //Tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ vinimayaḥ.// This brick, what is this brick? Brick means you take earth, mix with water and put into the fire---it becomes brick. And there is air. So it is Kṛṣṇa's energy. It is not material; it is Kṛṣṇa's energy. Because the philosophy is that Kṛṣṇa's energy should be used for Kṛṣṇa's purpose. Then it is spiritual. That is our philosophy. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, this, gives this formula:

> prāpañcikatayā buddhyā
> hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ
> mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo
> phalgu vairāgyaṁ kathyate
> [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.256]

//Phalgu-vairāgya. Phalgu// means false. False. The //phalgu,// from river Phalgu is... Here, in India, there is a river Phalgu. You'll see that there is no water on the surface of the river. But if you push your hand within the sand, you'll get water. So //phalgu-vairāgya// means that I am giving up, renouncing everything, superficially, but within me there is a desire how to become God. I am giving up, but I cannot give up this desire. There is big, big philosophy on this point. The... They are trying to become one with God. But a devotee does not try to become one with God or separated from God. They are satisfied. In whatever condition God keeps him, he's satisfied.

So separated energy, in this way you have to understand, that although this energy is separated from Kṛṣṇa, it can be used for Kṛṣṇa. And when it is used for Kṛṣṇa, then it is spiritual; it is no more material. Material means forgetfulness. //Karmīs// are constructing big, big houses, skyscraper houses. The purpose is to enjoy himself. The same thing, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ,// mixing together, brick or stone or cement, if it is used for Kṛṣṇa, then it is //yukta-vairāgya.//

> anāsaktasya viṣayān
> yathārham upayuñjataḥ
> nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe
> yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate
> [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.255]

So our philosophy is that. Although this material world, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]], they are separated from Kṛṣṇa, we can use it for Kṛṣṇa. Just like the same example: The tape recorder, it is material, but it can be used for Kṛṣṇa's purpose. We are writing books, recording in the tape recorder. That //nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.// There is no need of giving up this //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ,// as the Māyāvādī philosopher says. You can utilize. After all, it is Kṛṣṇa's energy. This is the best philosophy, that one man's property should be used for the proprietor. That is the best use.

So we do not neglect this //bhūmir āpaḥ...,// although it is separated energy, but when we reconnect in the service of the Lord, it becomes spiritual. It requires little time to understand. And the example, as we have given many times, that you put one iron rod in the fire, it becomes warm, warmer, warmer, warmer. Then, when it is red hot, it is no longer iron rod, but it is fire. Similarly, everything in this material world, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]], although it is separated from Kṛṣṇa, if you engage it in the service of Kṛṣṇa, it is no more material; it is spiritual. This is the philosophy of Vaiṣṇavas. //Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.//

So this is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you always remember that everything, whatever we are using, that is Kṛṣṇa's energy... We are also Kṛṣṇa's energy, //jīva-bhūta.// That will be explained in the next verse. //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām.// Another //prakṛti, parā-prakṛti,// spiritual energy. What is that? //Jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]. So both of us... The matter is also Kṛṣṇa's energy, and the spirit soul is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. And there is another, spiritual world. That is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy. So when the spiritual energy is engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa, even this material energy, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ,// that also becomes converted into spiritual energy exactly like that iron rod converted into fire.

So it requires intelligence. If you think how all things can be changed into spiritual world, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
