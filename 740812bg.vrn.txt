Translation: "Of all that is material and all that is spiritual in this world... [know for certain that I am both its origin and dissolution.]"

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] You can explain in Hindi this verse, so that others may hear in Hindi. Or you can come here. Speak it in English first. [break]

So Kṛṣṇa has explained that He is the source of two energies---the material energy and the spiritual energy. The material energy, consisting of earth, water, air, fire, mind, intelligence and ego; and the spiritual energy, //jīva-bhūta,// the living entities. The spiritual energy is described as superior, and material energy is described as inferior. But both of them are energies. Energy means it is controlled; it is generated. Just like electric energy. Electric energy, it is very powerful. Even by touching electric energy one is shockened immediately. So, but still that electric energy is generated through a source, and the source we call the executive engineer, or the resident engineer, in the electric powerhouse. So Kṛṣṇa says that source of energy, or the resident engineer, like the electric powerhouse, that is Kṛṣṇa.

In another place in the Tenth Chapter it is stated,

> mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ 
> sūyate sa-carācaram 
> [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]].

Both the //prakṛtis//---the superior //prakṛti, parā-prakṛti,// and //aparā-prakṛti//---both of them are working under the superintendence of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that "Both these energies, I am the source." //Aham...//

> etad-yonīni bhūtāni 
> sarvāṇīty upadhāraya 
> [[books:bg:7:6|[Bg. 7.6]]].

Whatever you are seeing within this material world, that is combination of this material and spiritual energy. Without spiritual energy, the material energy has no power. Therefore the spiritual energy is superior. But both of them are being controlled by Kṛṣṇa. Although there is nothing in this material world which is beyond these two energies, material and spiritual... Anything you take, a big machine, just like we have got experience the airplane, 747---big as it is a small village. Not small; a big, big village. Five hundred people, five hundred passengers are carried with their luggage---a huge airplane. This is latest. Now what is this big machinery? It is combination of these two energies: the pilot is the spiritual energy, and the machine, the plane, is material energy. Everyone can understand. It is very simple. Anything. //Etad-yonīni sarvāṇi.// Unless there are these two energies, there is no existence of anything. Anything you take. Just like this electric fan. Electric fan is made of metal. That is material energy. But unless I touch the button or I push the plug into electricity, it will not work.

So combination of two energies, material and the spiritual---anything. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //etad-yonīni sarvāṇi.// Not exception; everything. That is the combination of two energies, material and spiritual. And //ahaṁ kṛtsnasya:// "But these two energies are generated by Me. Therefore I am the source of everything." As it is..., //Vedānta-sūtra// it is said, to find out the original source of everything---//athāto brahma jijñāsā.// That original source is here, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ. Ahaṁ kṛtsnasya jagataḥ.// The whole universe, the whole cosmic manifestation, //prabhavaḥ. Prabhavaḥ// means "generation." The same thing, just like the electric light. I push the button: switch on, switch off. As soon as switch off, everything is dark. And as soon as switch on, it is light. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa says, //jagataḥ prabhavaḥ pralayaḥ. Prabhavaḥ:// on; the creation goes on. And as soon as He wants, this creation is off, immediately. That is the //sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śakti// [Bs. 5.44].

So everything is there. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [//Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad// 6.8]. He is the source of the switch on and switch off.

> yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya
> jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ
> [Bs 5.48]

That //niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya,// that is the switch on and switch off. Inhaling and exhaling, Mahā-Viṣṇu. By His exhaling, whole universe is coming out into existence, and by His inhaling it is all entering within His body. //Prakṛtiṁ māṁ eka,// it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Everything enters into the body of the Mahā-Viṣṇu during the //pralaya.// Again it is coming, //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. This world, this material world, in this way, as you have got experience, this body. Body is manifested at a certain date, and it will be annihilated at a certain date. So similarly, the huge cosmic manifestation, that is created at a certain date, and it will be annihilated at a certain date. //Jagataḥ prabhavaḥ pralayas tathā.//

So Kṛṣṇa is the original source of //prabhavaḥ pralaya.// But Kṛṣṇa is not under this //prabhava// and //pralaya.// This should be understood. //Aham evāsam evāgre// [[books:sb:2:9:33|[SB 2.9.33]]]. It is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that... Therefore Kṛṣṇa is not within this creation. From Him is created, and He existed before the creation. Because if you say Kṛṣṇa is the source of creation, or if we understand that, then He is beyond creation. So His body is not of this created energy. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā// [[books:bg:4:6|[Bg. 4.6]]]; that is spiritual energy. Kṛṣṇa is spiritual energy. Kṛṣṇa is not subjected to this creation and annihilation. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //janma karma me divyam// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. //Divyam// means that is transcendental. //Yo jānāti tattvataḥ. Tattvataḥ// means because Kṛṣṇa is the creator and annihilator... To understand Kṛṣṇa, that He is not subjected to this material creation and annihilation, this is //tattvataḥ. Janma karma me divyam.// We are born, and we die. That is under this principle, //prabhavaḥ pralayas tathā.// But Kṛṣṇa is not like that.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa said,

> avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā
> mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam
> [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]

Because He has come as a human being for the benefit of the human society:

> yadā yadā hi dharmasya
> glānir bhavati bhārata...
> tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham
> [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]

He comes because He is interested. We are living entities. We are Kṛṣṇa’s part and parcel. So He is very much interested with our sufferings. //Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. We are rotting in this material world, although we are eternal, //nityo nityānāṁ.// Kṛṣṇa is the supreme //nitya,// and we are plural number, //nityānāṁ.// We are also, because part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So //nitya.// Our nature is //nitya,//

> nityaḥśāśvato 'yaṁ
> na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre
> [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]

This is our nature. We should understand this. We are not subjected to birth and death, but we are. Why we are subjected to birth and death? This question was raised by Sanātana Gosvāmī to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //‘Ke āmi’, ‘kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya’// [[books:cc:madhya:20:102|[Cc. Madhya 20.102]]]: "I am not subjected..., I do not want all these miserable condition of life, but why I am forced to accept it?" This is the question of life, //athāto brahma jijñāsā.//

But people are not interested. That is not very good civilization. They do not inquire the prime necessities of life. They do not inquire, "Why shall I die? If I am //nitya,// if I am eternal, //śāśvataḥ, purāṇaḥ,// the oldest"---//na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre//---"if I do not die, if I am not annihilated after the death, after annihilation of this body, then why my body is annihilated? Why I am subjected to birth, death?" This is the problem.

> janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-
> duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam
> [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]

But we are not inquisitive. This is our foolishness. //Mūḍhā.// They do not know what is the problem of life. They are fighting in politics. Politics-created problems. There is everything... One party is thinking that "If I am the government, I shall make everything all right." But nobody knows the real problem, so they are fighting---all over the world. When I was [in] Rome, the same thing. There was a fighting between the Fascists and the Communists, and immediately, six person died by fighting. This is going on in ignorance. //Mūḍhā.// They do not know what is the problem of life, and unnecessarily they are creating temporary problems and fighting on them. They do not know what is Kṛṣṇa.

Therefore this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the supermost enlightening movement to the human society. Supermost. They are putting actually what is this problem, and solution of the problem. Solution of the problem means... Real problem is birth, death, old age and disease. So solution of problem means that if you don’t get this material body, then this is the solution. So long... That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma
> yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti
> na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam
> asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ
> [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]

This //deha---dehino 'smin yathā dehe//---this //deha, kleśada,// it is always miserable. That we do not know. We know, we experience, it is //kleśada,// which gives //kleśa,// miserable conditions, but we are callous on this point. We are fighting on superficial problems, created problem. There is no problem. Here, //pūrṇam idaṁ, pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. Everything is complete there. There is no cause. Just like the birds, beasts, they have no problem; but the problem of birth, death is there. Otherwise there is no problem in the beast society, bird society, animal society, aquatic society. They are living. The problem is birth, death. That is even in the, what is called, Brahmaloka. Brahmā also will also die.

So that is real problem. The human society should consider. That is human society, that they are..., they must try to solve the problems of birth and death. And that is very easy. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā:// very easy.

> janma karma me divyaṁ
> yo jānāti tattvataḥ 
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

You try to understand Kṛṣṇa. This is the land of Kṛṣṇa. You foreigners, you have come here. You just take shelter of Kṛṣṇa and try to understand Kṛṣṇa, then your all problem solved. Kṛṣṇa is explaining Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Here is the another explanation:

> etad-yonīni bhūtāni
> sarvāṇīty upadhāraya
> ahaṁ kṛtsnasya sarvasya
> jagataḥ...
> [[books:bg:7:6|[Bg. 7.6]]]

But //mūḍhā, avajānanti,// "Ah, He is a person. How He can be the source of everything?" But he does not know what kind of person He is. //Paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto.// The rascals, they do not know what is Kṛṣṇa. But try to understand Kṛṣṇa, then all problems will be solved, both material and spiritual.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa is so kind.

> yadā yadā hi..., 
> glānir bhavati bhārata, 
> tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham 
> [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]].

Kṛṣṇa descended. Kṛṣṇa came here in this Vṛndāvana land. He explained Himself in the Battle of Kurukṣetra, and also here, also. Everywhere. He is explaining, and He is practically demonstrating, this Vṛndāvana-līlā. So try to understand Kṛṣṇa, and your problems will be solved, because He is the origin of everything.

> ahaṁ kṛtsnasya jagataḥ 
> prabhavaḥ pralayas tathā 
> [[books:bg:7:6|[Bg. 7.6]]]

So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is simply to understand Kṛṣṇa. And that will be very easy, as it is introduced by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna. Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam// [//Śikṣāṣṭaka// 1]. Very easy. //Paraṁ vijayate:// simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.//

> harer nāma harer nāma
> harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva
> nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

> kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya
> mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet
> [SB 12.3.51]

Simply by chanting. This is the special advantage of this age, Kali-yuga. It is very bad age. It is very bad. The people are suffering. //Durbhikṣa-kara-pīḍitāḥ// [SB 12.2.9]. One side there is scarcity of food, and one side there is heavy taxation by the government. These are stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: durbhikṣa-kara-pīḍitāḥ.//

> ācchinna-dāra-draviṇā
> gacchanti giri-kānanam
> [SB 12.2.8]

In this age we’ll be so much disturbed, more and more, by //durbhikṣa, anāvṛṣṭi.// There will be scarcity of rain, and there will be no food production, and on the other side, government will present every six months a big budget, big: "Give me tax." This is the position. //Durbhikṣa-kara... Anāvṛṣṭyā, durbhikṣa-kara-pīḍitāḥ. Ācchinna-dāra-draviṇā yāsyanti giri-kānanam.// People will be mad, they’ll be so much... But that is our //karma-phal. Karma-phal.// Because we do not hear Kṛṣṇa. We do not hear Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is giving solution of all the problems, but we do not hear Kṛṣṇa. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the source of solution, is the means of solution of all problem.

So if you simply try to understand. Here is Kṛṣṇa explains,

> ahaṁ kṛtsnasya jagataḥ
> prabhavaḥ pralayas tathā 
> [[books:bg:7:6|[Bg. 7.6]]]

The next verse will be explained that if you think, just like the Māyāvādīs, they think that Kṛṣṇa has taken a form; ultimately the Absolute Truth is impersonal, that is formless. But Kṛṣṇa denies that. Kṛṣṇa says,

> mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat
> kiñcid asti dhanañjaya
> [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]

If you think that above Kṛṣṇa there is impersonal Brahman, that is wrong idea. Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ:// "There is no more superior truth than Me." That means the Personality of God is the ultimate truth. That is understood by Arjuna, that "Nobody can understand Your personality." That is //mūḍhā.//

> avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ
> manyante mām abuddhayaḥ 
> [[books:bg:7:24|[Bg. 7.24]]]

The //abuddhayaḥ,// less intelligent class of men, they think that "I was //avyaktaṁ,// impersonal. Now I have assumed a form." No. He is originally the form: Kṛṣṇa, //dvi-bhuja murlīdhāra;// Kṛṣṇa, the friend of the //gopīs// and the cowherds boy and the son of Nanda Mahārāja, son of mother Yaśodā. He is a person.

> brahmeti paramātmeti
> bhagavān iti śabdyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]

The Absolute Truth, they are understood from three angles of vision:

> brahmeti paramātmeti
> bhagavān iti śabdyate

//Bhagavān// is the ultimate. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,

> mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat
> kiñcid asti dhanañjaya
> [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]

Therefore take to Kṛṣṇa, Śyāmasundara, and worship Him. Your all problems will be solved.

Thank you very much.
