**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, you editor, I think it has to be corrected. //Tvā// means "You." It is not "although." Read.

**Nitāi:**
[reads translation responsively with devotees:]

[00:56]

"Śrīmatī Kuntī said: O Kṛṣṇa, I offer my obeisances unto You because You are the original personality and are unaffected by the qualities of material nature. You are existing both within and without everything, yet You are invisible to all."

**Prabhupāda:**

> namasye puruṣaṁ tvādyam
> īśvaraṁ prakṛteḥ param
> alakṣyaṁ sarva-bhūtānām
> antar bahir avasthitam
> [[books:sb:1:8:18|[SB 1.8.18]]]

So Kuntī is the aunt, //pisimā,// aunt of Kṛṣṇa. Vasudeva's sister, Kuntī. So when Kṛṣṇa was going back to Dvārakā, after finishing the Battle of Kurukṣetra and establishing Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira on the throne, His mission... His mission was that Duryodhana should be thrown out, and Yudhiṣṭhira must sit down on the throne. Dharma, Dharmarāja.

That is the desire of Kṛṣṇa, or God, that the state executive head should be as pious as Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. That is the scheme. Unfortunately, people do not want that. They have now discovered this democracy. Democracy... "Demon-cracy." Shortcut of "demon-cracy" is "democracy." All the demons and rogues, they gather together, somehow or other votes, and occupy the seat, and the business is plundering. The business is plundering. If we talk very much upon this, it will not be very favorable, but according to //śāstra...// We, we talk according to //śāstra,// that the democracy means assembly of rogues and plunderers. That is the statement in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Dasyu-dharmabhiḥ.// The government men will be all //dasyu. Dasyu// means plunderer---not pickpocket. Pickpocket, somehow or other, if you do not understand, takes something from your pocket; and the plunderer, or the //dasyu,// he catches you and by force, "If you don't spare your money, I shall kill you." They are called //dasyu.//

So the, in the present age of Kali, the government men will be //dasyu.// This is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Dasyu-dharmabhiḥ.// You can..., we can see practically. You cannot keep your money. You earn with hard labor, but you cannot keep gold, you cannot keep jewelry, you cannot keep money. And... They will take it away by laws. So they make law that... Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja was just quite opposite. He wanted to see that every citizen is so happy that they are not troubled even by excessive heat and excessive cold. //Ati-vyādhi.// They are not suffering from any disease, they are not suffering from excessive climatic influence; eating very nicely, and feeling security of person and property. That was Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja. Not only Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja; almost all the kings, they were like that.

So Kṛṣṇa is the original king, because He is stated here, //puruṣam ādyam īśvaram. Īśvaram// means controller. He's the original controller. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Mayādhyakṣeṇa. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. Even this material nature, wonderful things are going on, that is being controlled by Kṛṣṇa. This is to be understood. So we are reading //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and other Vedic literature. What is the purpose? The purpose is //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. The purpose is to understand Kṛṣṇa. If you don't understand Kṛṣṇa, then your reading of so-called //Vedas// and //Vedāntas// and //Upaniṣads,// they are useless waste of time. So here Kuntī is directly saying that "My dear Kṛṣṇa, You are //ādyaṁ puruṣam,// the original person. And //īśvaram.// You are not ordinary person. You are the supreme controller." That is understanding of Kṛṣṇa. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. Everyone is controller, but the supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa.

So although this material world is condemned---//duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]], Kṛṣṇa says---it is also Kṛṣṇa's kingdom, because everything belongs to God, Kṛṣṇa. So this condemned place is created for suffering of the condemned persons. Who are condemned? Those who have forgotten Kṛṣṇa and wants to become happy independently, they are all condemned demons. And those who are surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, they are not condemned. That is the difference. So although Kṛṣṇa has created this material world for the condemned person, still, He wants to see that they are having their necessities of life and..., so that they may live prosperously. And let them enjoy for some time this material world according to their inclination. But at last, let them come back home, back to home, back to Godhead. Just like the prisoners: they are condemned, and the government puts them into jail. So for their criminality they are punished within the jail. But the government does not want that these prisoners may remain perpetually within the jail. The same thing. Try to understand. Government does not want. Government wants that "They have been condemned. So for their criminality, let them suffer for some time. And then they correct themselves and again they are freed."

Not that government does... Sometimes government arranges nice instruction, classes. Perhaps those who were with me in Ahmedabad... We were invited by the jail authorities to speak. Who were with me? Nobody? In Ahmedabad?

**Devotee:**
I was.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So I was given place just in front of the room where Gandhi was imprisoned. That..., that room is considered as sacred. So government makes such arrangement that "These prisoners may be corrected." Similarly, in this material world, although we are all condemned... Anyone who is within this material world, he is condemned. Simply there is division. Just like in jail also, there are first-class prisoners, there are second-class prisoners and third-class prisoners. The first-class prisoners, they are given some facilities. Just like political prisoners, they are given separate bungalow and servants, newspaper, book. But they cannot go out of the prison. That is called first class. Similarly, there are second class, and third class, ordinary.

So here also, we are first-class, second-class, third-class prisoners. Therefore we find so many varieties of living condition. But we are all prisoners. And He's the supreme controller. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, as supreme controller, He wants His representative to rule over this material world. That is Kṛṣṇa's mission. In every planet there is a person, representative of Kṛṣṇa, who is ruling over the planet. Just like the sun planet: the sun planet is being ruled by the sun-god. His name is Vivasvān. He was also instructed by Kṛṣṇa, and that is explained in the Fourth Chapter, //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]: "I spoke this philosophy of //Bhagavad-gītā...//" Just like He spoke to Arjuna, similarly He spoke also. And who can know? He spoke to all the rulers of different planets---Indra, Candra, Varuṇa, sun-god, moon-god, that... So many. Thirty-three millions of planets and thirty-three millions of ruler. So He wants His representative.

So it is the duty of the representative of Kṛṣṇa to reform these condemned person to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is their duty. Kṛṣṇa wants that "These rascals, these condemned persons who are suffering in this material world, and they cannot understand that 'We are suffering...,' they are making plan. No plan will be successful." //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. You can make your plan, but it will never be successful. The only plan will be successful---what is that? //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. That is the only plan. There is no other plan. But these rascals, they are being put into severe penalties---//duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]---more and mo... The more they are forgetting God, they are put in..., they are put into more and more miserable condition. Practically we see, with the advancement Kali-yuga, people are forgetting his relationship with Kṛṣṇa, and the price of commodity and the food grains, the price is increasing. They cannot eat sufficiently. So many people are dying of starvation. If they cannot eat, how they will live?

Therefore Kṛṣṇa gives His instruction. He's the supreme ruler. He gives this order: //annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]], "You require food grains." This is practical. Who will disagree with Kṛṣṇa, that "We don't require food grains; we require bolts and nuts in the factory"? Who will say? This is practical. So they do not... Just like we see here that, that they do not grow food grains. They are growing jute, because they will get some money, more money. But the rascal does not know that "I will get more money, and it will be taken away next by the food grain seller." So similarly, we are interested in industry, in plan-making, this, that, so many things. But Kṛṣṇa does not say that "You open slaughterhouse and industries and brothels and cinema." No. Kṛṣṇa does not say. Kṛṣṇa says, "Grow more food, rascal! You'll eat and become strong." And nobody is obeying Kṛṣṇa. Is it not? Practically try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.// Not by sentiment. And preach this philosophy all over the world.

What Kṛṣṇa says, that is practical. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. "How we shall get //anna?// There is no rain." You see nowadays, there is no rain. Why? Because you are..., we are all rascals. We do not know how to get rain. Kṛṣṇa says, //parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ:// "There will be food grains when there is sufficient rain." And how rain there will be? //Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]: "And if you perform //yajña,// then there will be sufficient rain." So nowadays you..., people may say, "How to perform //yajña?// It requires so much money, so much //ghee,// so much food grains to offer as oblations." But Kṛṣṇa has made it very easy. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyaiḥ.// I know, the //śāstras// know that in the Kali-yuga it will be very difficult to perform the ritualistic //yajña// ceremony because people will be poor, poverty-stricken. Where they will get //ghee,// and where they will get grains? No. This is //yajña: kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā. Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. This is //yajña.//

So people are so rascal, they will not even chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Kṛṣṇa, //svayaṁ bhagavān...// Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He introduced. //Saṅkīrtanaika-pitarau.// Gaura and Nityānanda is the father of the //saṅkīrtana// movement. Therefore Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has offered his prayer, //saṅkīrtanaika-pitarau ājānu-lambita-bhujau kanakāvadātau, saṅkīrtanaika-pitarau kamalāyatākṣau// [//CB Ādi-khaṇḍa// 1.1], //vande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam.// So Kṛṣṇa is teaching. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. He's personally teaching, that is "Perform //yajña.//" He's personally chanting, dancing, Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The picture is in our front. Personally He's teaching us, "Perform this //yajña,// you rascal, and you'll get everything. You'll get everything." Now, where is the proof? The proof is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We are simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// and spending //crores// of rupees. Simply. What we are doing? We are not doing any business. We have not many professional men. But why we are getting...? We are spending eight //lakhs// of rupees per month. And we have got food, we have got milk. We are, rather, feeding others also, bringing food. So why don't you see practically how these Kṛṣṇa conscious people... They... They know that we are fabulously rich. This question was raised in Parliament also. So how we became fabulously rich? We do not do anything. I have not taught you anything magic. I simply request you, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// sixteen times, please." But you... We are not even following that. This is the only remedy. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32].

So Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Īśvara. He's teaching us this //yajña.// He's giving us the hint. //Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. If you do not accept this Movement, then you'll go on suffering, suffering, suffering, suffering. If you don't accept this principle, then your future is simply suffering.

> prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ sabhya
> kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ
> mandāḥ sumanda-matayo
> manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ
> [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]

This is the symptoms of Kali-yuga. //Manda-bhāgyāḥ,// all unfortunate. All unfortunate. Everyone must suffer. This is the position. But if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// perform the //yajña...// Because this is the instruction by the Supreme Person. //Puruṣaṁ tvā ādyam. Ādyaṁ puruṣam,// the original person. The origin of everything, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]], the Supreme Person, from whom everything has come down. That is the order. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught us that //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. We are certainly in difficult position, but the only remedy is that we must chant the holy name of the Lord repeatedly. And that will solve all the problems. You preach this cult all over the world.

So Kṛṣṇa is the original person. He has admitted, and //śāstra// admits, and here is another authority, Kuntī. Kuntī, the mother of the Pāṇḍavas. Kuntī's not ordinary woman. Kṛṣṇa has gone to offer His respect, to take the dust of his [her] feet. Because materially she happens to be aunt of Kṛṣṇa, elderly lady, superior, so Kṛṣṇa has gone to pay His respect before departing. That is the system, Vedic system, to offer respect to the superior first of all. Before going... "No..." Kṛṣṇa is going. "[S]he knows that 'I am Personality of Godhead.' " No. Kṛṣṇa was touching the feet of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira because he was elder brother. When Kṛṣṇa used to come at the Pāṇḍavas' house, every Pāṇḍavas knew that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It was not unknown to them. But Kṛṣṇa was coming down and touching the feet of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. And Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was not returning. He was embracing Him because He was younger brother. So this is the etiquette.

So the idea is that Kṛṣṇa is the original person. That is admitted by Arjuna also, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ ādyam// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. They know, knew it. Not only Kuntī knows. But Kṛṣṇa was, when present, how many people knew Him? Only the Pāṇḍavas knew Him perfectly, the Pāṇḍava family. And some of the other, Kuru family. Bhīṣma knew Him. Even Dhṛtarāṣṭra also knew Him. And many other saintly persons, Vyāsadeva, Devala, Nārada Muni. Nārada Muni, of course, does not belong to this planet. So to know Kṛṣṇa is not very easy job. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. Still, if Kṛṣṇa is pleased, then He can make Himself known to a devotee. //Athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi, jānāti tattvam// [SB 10.14.29]. Anyone who is in receipt of little favor of Kṛṣṇa, he can understand Kṛṣṇa.

So Kṛṣṇa is the original person. Another significance of this verse: Kṛṣṇa is not woman. Just like there are some so-called speculators, that "Kṛṣṇa is also... Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute Truth, or the Supreme Person, can..., is also woman." But He's not woman. He can assume the role of woman if He likes, but does not mean He's woman, woman. He's man. Man means the enjoyer. Man, or //puruṣa.// Not man; //puruṣa.// So They are //puruṣāvatāra.// The three Viṣṇus, They are called //puruṣāvatāra.// Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu and the Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, They are called //puruṣāvatāra.// So Kṛṣṇa is //puruṣa.// Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer. And //ādyam,// the original enjoyer. //Ādyam, puruṣam.// But what kind of //puruṣa?// Like you and me? Just like we are also assuming //puruṣa,// "I am male." Not like you. //Prakṛteḥ param.// These //puruṣa...// I am //puruṣa,// another man is..., another living entity is woman. These are dresses given by this material nature.

Actually, we are not //puruṣa.// We are all //prakṛtis.// It is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> apareyam itas tu
> viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām
> jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho
> yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat
> [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]

We are all //prakṛtis.// Don't try to become enjoyer. //Prakṛti// means enjoyed. //Prakṛti// is predominated, and //puruṣa// is the predominator. So because we are..., actually our constitutional position is to become predominated and we are trying artificially to become predominator, that is the trouble. Every one of us, we are trying to become predominator. Actually, we should be predominated. So when we agree to become predominated and agree to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa, I was so long under misconception that I am predominator. You are predominator; I am predominated. So I surrender unto You." //Mānasa deha geha jo kichu mora, arpiluṅ tuwā pade nanda-kiśora.// This is Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's statement. If we become like that, then we'll be happy---to be predominated.

And don't try to become imitator. But the imitation is so strong that even persons who are very much elevated in knowledge, they are also falsely presenting that "I am God." The //māyā's// influence is so strong that at the last stage... Therefore they fall down. These people, these Māyāvādīs who are trying to become God... //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]], to merge into the existence of the Supreme. You can merge, but you cannot be equal. That is not possible. //Asamordhva.// But the Māyāvādīs, they are thinking, "We are as good as Kṛṣṇa." Therefore they do not go to the temple of Kṛṣṇa, because they think self Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa. But that is a mistake. Therefore //śāstra// says that //ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ.// They are thinking that they have become liberated, become Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, God, but that is //aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.// Because... They are thinking like that because their intelligence is not yet cleansed. //Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.// Therefore //āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ anādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa,// by performing severe austerities, penances, they come to the stage of merging in the Brahman effulgence, but that [will] not solve the problem. In the Brahman effulgence they fall down again.

So Kṛṣṇa is the only //puruṣa. Prakṛteḥ param.// So //prakṛteḥ param.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa is not a //puruṣa// like us. We are within the //prakṛti.// We are within the //prakṛti.// He is beyond the //prakṛti.// Therefore His body is not material. He's not within the //prakṛti.// But the rascals, they cannot understand this. They think that "Kṛṣṇa is like us." //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. So because they are //mūḍhas,// they think that "Kṛṣṇa is like us. Kṛṣṇa has a body like us." But that is actually not the fact. Here Kuntī says, authority says, //prakṛteḥ param. Prakṛteḥ param, alakṣyam.// The //prakṛteḥ param...// Suppose something beyond our vision. Just like we are sitting down this house; we cannot see what is going on upstairs. //Alakṣyam.// So if Kṛṣṇa is a person beyond this material creation, how we can see Him? //Alakṣyam. Alakṣyaṁ sarva-bhūtānām.// Still, He is in everyone's heart. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]].

So //alakṣyam,// invisible, those who are //yogīs,// they are trying to see. They are trying to... //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. //Dhyānāvasthita.// They are trying to see. So there are different processes of seeing, but actually you can see by one process. That is //bhakti. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. So those who have taken the path of devotional service, they'll be able to understand that Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma. Ahaṁ brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhā.// Kṛṣṇa is the origin of this Brahman effulgence, you have heard so many times. Kṛṣṇa is Paramātmā, and Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this way try to understand Kṛṣṇa, and then you are liberated.

Thank you very much.
