[loud sound of fireworks, firecrackers, etc., going on in background]

**Nitāi:** "O most pious mother, I shall now explain unto you the ancient yoga system which I explained formerly unto the great sages. It is serviceable and practical in every way."

**Prabhupāda:**

> tam imaṁ te pravakṣyāmi
> yam avocaṁ purānaghe
> ṛṣīṇāṁ śrotu-kāmānāṁ
> yogaṁ sarvāṅga-naipuṇam
> [[books:sb:3:25:14|[SB 3.25.14]]]

So Kapiladeva, previous verse He said that //yoga ādhyātmikaḥ puṁsāṁ mato niḥśreyasāya me// [[books:sb:3:25:13|[SB 3.25.13]]]. The supreme //yoga// system is //ādhyātmikaḥ,// or pertaining to the soul. Just like in your country a...

[loud fireworks]

Nowadays the //haṭha-yoga// is very popular. Sometimes the fat ladies go there to reduce their fat, and... [laughter] Some bodily... Here also they practice //yoga// to keep the digestive system regular. So people like this kind of //yoga,// gymnastics. But real //yoga// is //ādhyātmika. Ādhyātmika// means to awaken the soul to his proper position. That is real //yoga.// So that is not a manufactured, novel concoction. That is //purāṇa.// As the soul is //purāṇa, śāśvataḥ purāṇaḥ,// similarly his business is also //śāśvataḥ purāṇaḥ.// That business is to reconnect his lost relationship with Kṛṣṇa.

So Kapiladeva says that "The same //yoga// system which I previously spoke to the great //ṛṣis,// who were very eager to hear..." //Ṛṣīṇāṁ śrotu-kāmānām.// This is one of the qualification for spiritual advancement: one must be eager to hear. Because the spiritual life begins by hearing.

> ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi
> na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ
> sevonmukhe hi jihvādau
> svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]

This is the statement of //śāstra,// that with our these blunt material senses it is not possible to appreciate or to understand //śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi//---Kṛṣṇa, His name, His form, His quality, His pastimes, His paraphernalia, His abode, so many things. Kṛṣṇa is not alone, but Kṛṣṇa begins from the name. Then there is form. Generally, for the beginners, neophytes, these two things are essential: to hear the name, to hear the qualities, and see the form of the Lord, to offer worship. That is the instruction of Kṛṣṇa personally. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]].

So here Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa is present. Even a child comes and offers his respect, it is taken into account, that "Here is a devotee." He does not know anything. Simply by seeing the chanting and dancing---you'll see practically---even a small child, he dances, he claps, he enjoys. He takes part. So the temple means to give chance to everyone, even to the child, to advance one step to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One step. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]]. Even little is accepted and is done, it becomes into account. Just like if you deposit even two annas in the bank, it is kept on your account. It will increase with interest. Similarly, devotional service even done very little, it is not lost. It is not lost. In the //śāstra// it is said that even it is lost... Not lost. Suppose some reason a man comes and joins this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and in the middle he falls down; he does not make further progress because he falls down. But whatever he has done, that is permanent credit. That will never be lost. Even he stops, then from that point, again he will begin as soon as there will be chance. But whatever he has done, that is a permanent credit. That is the instruction of //śāstra.//

Therefore it is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā, śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sañjayate// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. //Yoga-bhraṣṭaḥ. Bhraṣṭa// means he was executing devotional service, but some way or other, being allured by //māyā// or some..., some other causes, even if he falls down, so that credit is there. Therefore he has to begin next life... He is given chance next life. What is that? //Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe.// He takes birth in two families. What is that? //Śucīnām. Śucīnām// means //brāhmaṇa, śuci. Śuci// means //brāhmaṇa:// always clean and pure. Therefore they are called //śuci.// And //muci. Muci// means cobbler, just the end. That is the lowest, and this is the highest, //śuci// and //muci.// There is a Bengali poetry: //śuci haya muci haya yadi kṛṣṇa tyaje, muci haya śuci haya yadi kṛṣṇa bhaje.// If somebody takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even born in the family of cobbler, //muci,// he becomes //śuci.// He becomes more than a //brāhmaṇa.// And //muci haya śuci haya.// If one is born in the family of a //brāhmaṇa,// but he... [loud sounds of fireworks] ...but if he gives up Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he becomes a //muci.//

So a devotee, whoever he may be, everyone, for everyone, the path of devotion is open. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. Kṛṣṇa says personally. It doesn't matter, //pāpa-yoni,// low-grade family, //pāpa-yonayaḥ,// if he takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa... //Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.// And Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, //kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ ye 'nye ca pāpā, ye anye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ śudhyanti// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice. It is all-embracing. There are many... //Tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ hareḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:17|[SB 1.5.17]]], //patet tato yadi, bhajann apakvo 'tha. Tyaktvā sva-dharmam. Sva-dharmam// means everyone has got his occupational duty, //sva-dharma.// Generally, we consider //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// They have got their //sva-dharma. Brāhmaṇa// has got his duties, //kṣatriya// has got his duty. //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā-sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. So //sva-dharma// means... Suppose one gives up his occupational duty and takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ hareḥ,// and takes to the shelter of Kṛṣṇa, but //bhajann apakvaḥ,// could not mature his devotional service, //bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi,// and he falls down... This is Nārada's statement. So he says, "What is the loss even if he falls down? By sentiment he comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and even if he falls down, still, where is the loss? And contrary to this, a man who is performing very perfectly his //sva-dharma// but has no Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then what is the gain?" There is no gain.

So that //yoga// system, //ādhyātmika,// is being explained by Kapiladeva, that you'll never fall down. Permanent, fixed-up position. Once begun, it will continue. Even if you fall down, then you are given chance again. What is that? //Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sañjayate// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. Very nice family, //brāhmaṇa// family. //Brāhmaṇa// family means Vaiṣṇava family. //Brāhmaṇa-vaiṣṇava, brāhmaṇa-paṇḍita. Brāhmaṇa// means he must be learned and he must be a Vaiṣṇava. //Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ// [//Ṛg Veda// 1.22.20]. Viṣṇu. Therefore in every //brāhmaṇa// house there is //viṣṇu-pūjā,// Viṣṇu-śālagrāma. Still. From descent, I mean to say, generation, it is coming down. //Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,// they are supposed to worship Lord Viṣṇu. Not only //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra... Śūdra// also. //Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. This is statement of //Viṣṇu Purāṇa. Varṇāśrama,// the execution of duty in the institution of //varṇa// and //āśrama,// four //varṇas// and four //āśramas,// what is the meaning? The meaning is //viṣṇur ārādhyate:// Viṣṇu becomes very pleased. That is //varṇāśrama-dharma.//

If you execute as a //pakkā brāhmaṇa,// that means Viṣṇu will be pleased. If you execute your duties as a perfect //kṣatriya,// then Viṣṇu will be pleased. If you execute your duty as a perfect //vaiśya,// then Viṣṇu will be pleased. And if you execute your duties as a perfect //śūdra,// Viṣṇu will be pleased. The purpose is to please Viṣṇu. Therefore, //na te viduḥ...// The purpose they do not know. They have forgotten. Not now. This is the nature of this material world: //na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi...,// to please Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu means Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa means Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu is expansion of Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa has millions of forms---as Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa and other also. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. //Ananta-rūpam. Ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// So //viṣṇur ārādhyate puṁsāṁ nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam.// There is no other alternative to please Him. Therefore //varṇāśrama-dharma// is very important. That is the beginning of perfect human civilization.

But we have lost everything. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu... He's also Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa Himself. Just to give relief to these rotten or forgotten conditioned souls of this age, Kali-yuga, He has given this one //mantra,// which is called //mahā-mantra.// What is that?

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

It is no longer possible to revive the perfect system, //varṇāśrama.// Although we are trying to revive, it is not possible. It is very difficult. People are so fallen. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. They are so disturbed, //manda-bhāgyāḥ,// unfortunate, and //upadrutāḥ,// always disturbed. Especially //anāvṛṣṭi, durbhikṣa// and //kara-pīḍita.// The people of Kali-yuga will be very much, I mean to say, harassed by these three things. There will be no rainfall, and... There will be no rainfall, and there, food scarcity and taxation by government, income tax. Income tax is to plunder. If you have got some money, this is the means. So this is all stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// People will be so much harassed that //ācchinna-dāra-draviṇā gacchanti giri-kānanam// [SB 12.2.8]. They'll be disgusted so much, they will give up their family all of a sudden. //Dāra-draviṇāḥ. Dāra// means wife, children and bank balance, everything, "Let them go to..." Recently we have seen one big industrialist, he has committed suicide. So people will do that, they'll be so much harassed. This is Kali-yuga.

So in this position of harassment, how the peaceful //varṇāśrama// can be revived? It is very difficult. It is almost impossible. Therefore this system should be taken. What is this system? //Saṅkīrtanair yajñair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ.// Those who have got brain, they will worship Viṣṇu. //Yajña// means to satisfy Viṣṇu. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyaiḥ. Viṣṇur ārādhyate puṁsāṁ nānyat tat-toṣa...// The whole aim is to satisfy Viṣṇu. Therefore Viṣṇu comes Himself: Kṛṣṇa. Viṣṇu comes Himself as Caitanya Mahāprabhu and teaches. There is no difference between Viṣṇu's teachings... Other, bogus teacher, they can teach something else, but Viṣṇu's teachings... Just like Kṛṣṇa. Whatever Kṛṣṇa... Of course, Kṛṣṇa incarnation was after Kapila's incarnation. Before that, there were other Viṣṇu incarnation. So here it is said, //tam imaṁ te pravakṣyāmi yam avocaṁ purā anaghe. Purā,// "Formerly. I am not manufacturing." Nowadays it has become a fashion to manufacture a new system of religion. It is not that. It is not new. Old, //purā.// Kṛṣṇa also says that,

> imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
> proktavān aham avyayam
> vivasvān manave prāha
> manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt
> [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]

> evaṁ paramparā-prāptam
> imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ
> [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]

"And I am speaking that very //yoga// system again to you."

So this is real incarnation. They'll not say anything which is..., which was not spoken before. The same thing: //yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.// "That //yoga// has been lost. Therefore, My dear Arjuna, I am repeating the same //yoga// system unto you." "Why to me? Why not to others?" //Bhakto 'si:// "Because you are My dear friend." //Priyo 'si// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]: "You are My dear friend." Because, without being //bhakta,// nobody will understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is not possible. //Bhagavad-gītā// means to understand Kṛṣṇa. So although everything is explained there, but it is on the //bhakti// line, not in any other line. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says at the end, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. If anyone wants to understand Kṛṣṇa and wants relationship with Kṛṣṇa, then one must take to this process of //bhakti-yoga.// That is //sāṅkhya-yoga.// That will be explained by Kapiladeva. //Bhakti-yoga// means //sāṅkhya-yoga.//

So here it is said, //tam imaṁ te pravakṣyāmi yam avocaṁ purā anaghe.// And He is addressing mother, //anaghe. Anagha// means "one who has no sinful reaction in life." That is called //anagha. Agha// means //pāpa,// sin; and //ana, ana// means without. Therefore nobody can understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness unless he is free from all sinful life.

> yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

One can stick to Kṛṣṇa consciousness when one is completely free from all sinful reaction of life. So you may say that "It will take some time. If I have to get free from sinful reaction, then I'll have to take some time." Kṛṣṇa says, "No, no time. Immediately."

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi...
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

"I will immediately do that. You just do this business. Surrender unto Me, and I take guarantee." Then your life begins.

//Sarva-pāpa-vinirmuktam..., sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Upādhi// means //pāpa. Upādhi...// If we get different bodies, that is due to our sinful actions. If I am given the chance to execute as a human being, this human form of body... //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. We have got this body after many, many evolutionary process. So this is a chance given to we. //Hari hari biphale.// Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is singing, //hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu:// "My dear Lord, Kṛṣṇa, I have wasted my time for nothing, uselessly." Why? //Manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā, jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu:// "Because I got this opportunity, the human form of life... It was meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa." Or add Kṛṣṇa with Rādhārāṇī. That is perfect Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa alone is Vāsudeva, and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa is perfect, with all potencies. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya// 13.65, //purport//]. The Absolute Truth with potencies. Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the source of all potencies. //Rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktiḥ// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. The Rādhārāṇī is the manifestation of Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. Kṛṣṇa, when He wants to enjoy, He does not enjoy anything material. He expands His energy, potency. That is Rādhārāṇī. //Hlādinī śaktir asmād ekātmānāv api bhuvi purā deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. So these are the... So if we want... That is the... Human life is meant for that. As Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //manuṣya-janama pāiyā rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu:// "My dear Lord, I have simply wasted my time, although I got the opportunity of this human form of life." Why you have wasted? "Now, I have done everything without worshiping Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa." That's all.

So what is this...? Now... //Jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu.// It is just like taking poison knowingly. Somebody takes poison unknowingly and somebody takes poison to commit suicide, knowingly. So it is something like that. If we do not understand Kṛṣṇa in this life, then we are taking poison knowingly. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //yadā yadā hi...// Because they are taking poison. They got the chance of eternal life, but they are taking poison. //Viṣaya-viṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jvale.// This material life is just like blazing fire of poison. //Viṣaya-viṣānale. Viṣaya// means material. //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna.// Eating, sleeping and sex life and defense---these are the material activities. So we are engaged with these things. So //viṣaya-viṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jvale.// And if we become engaged with these four things, //viṣaya,// it is like poison. Then our heart will be always burning. Gastric ulcer.

So it has to be cured. How it can be cured? Now, //golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana, rati nā janmilo kene tāy:// "My dear Lord, You have given the medicine, //hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana,// the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// but I have no attraction for this." So this is the realization of the Vaiṣṇava. //Brajendra-nandana jei, śaci-suta hailo sei:// "Vrajendra-nandana, Kṛṣṇa, He has now come as Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Śacī-suta, the son of mother Śacī." //Balarāma hailo nitāi:// "And Balarāma has become Nitāi." So what is their business now? Now, //pāpī tāpī jata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo:// "All kinds of varieties of sinful men, simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// they are delivered." //Tāra sākṣī jagāi// and //mādhāi.// What is the evidence? Evidence is Jagāi-Mādhāi. So at the present moment, not only one Jagāi-Mādhāi, but thousands of Jagāi-Mādhāi, by the grace of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, are being delivered. It is so active medicine, this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.//

Therefore the perfect //yoga// system... //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]]. So He'll speak that. //Tam imaṁ te pravakṣyāmi.// So it is not newly manufactured. We don't concoct anything. That is not our business. Our business is very simple. Our business is very simple because we take the words of Kṛṣṇa as it is. That's all. Kṛṣṇa says, //satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. So we are simply... We don't want to be very learned. We simply want blessings of you all, that let us become so much learned that we can follow the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. We don't want anything more. We don't want. Therefore we're sticking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement on the basis of //Bhagavad-gītā.// And a little farther advanced, by reading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// These are //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// And as I have told you, the Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that "Every one of you, especially Indians..." Indians? They are imitating this material civilization. Horrible. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given us open way:

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This is Indians' business, //para-upakāra.// The whole world is in darkness without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Every Indian should first of all make his life successful by understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //Bhagavad-gītā,// and preach it all over the world. That is the Indian business.

Thank you very much.
