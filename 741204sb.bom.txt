**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.] [break]

> paśyanti te me rucirāṇy amba santaḥ

"O My mother, My devotees always see the smiling face of My form, with eyes like the rising morning sun. They like to see My various transcendental forms, which are all benevolent, and they also talk favorably with Me."

**Prabhupāda:**

> paśyanti te me rucirāṇy amba santaḥ
> prasanna-vaktrāruṇa-locanāni
> rūpāṇi divyāni vara-pradāni
> sākaṁ vācaṁ spṛhaṇīyāṁ vadanti
> [[books:sb:3:25:35|[SB 3.25.35]]]

In the previous verse it is said, //anyonyato bhāgavatāḥ prasajya sabhājayante mama pauruṣāṇi// [[books:sb:3:25:34|[SB 3.25.34]]]. Those who are devotees, they assemble together. //Bodhayantaḥ parasparam.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, "They discuss about the glories of the Lord." //Bodhayantaḥ parasparam.// That is //sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]]. We have also discussed this. //Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]. When things are discussed about the Supreme Personality of Godhead amongst the devotees, it becomes a different thing than the discussion in the debating club of the nondevotees. The //kṛṣṇa-kathā// is not a subject matter for debating club. It is meant for the devotees. Without devotees, nobody can understand. The others, who are not devotee, they simply waste their time in reading //Bhagavad-gītā// or //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// such literature. They simply waste their time, because these subject matters are for the devotees.

We have several times discussed this point that the so-called scholars, politicians and philosophers, they read //Bhagavad-gītā// and comment in a different way. This is their foolishness. They cannot understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is not possible. My Guru Mahārāja used to say, "It is just like licking the bottle of honey." Now you want honey. I give you one bottle, but you do not know how to taste it. You began to lick up the bottle. So what you will taste? If you think, "Here is the bottle of honey. Let me lick," you will not get any taste. It must be opened. But the opening key is with the devotee. You do not know how to open it. Therefore it is said, //satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]. The devotees know how to open it, the bottle. And then they can taste. Therefore, //sabhājayante yatra pauruṣāṇi.//

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna that "I am speaking to you this science of //Bhagavad-gītā.//" //Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. //Idaṁ yogam. Bhagavad-gītā// means //bhakti-yogam.// So Kṛṣṇa said formerly, say, four hundred millions of years ago. //Bhagavad-gītā// is not new. It is... First of all it was spoken to sun-god, and from the Manu's age and others' age we can calculate it is about some millions of years ago it was spoken. //Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. So Kṛṣṇa said, "That very old //yoga// system I am speaking to you again. It is not a new thing that I am manufacturing for you. No." Everything... God is eternal, and His instruction is also eternal. And the followers are also eternal. There is nothing new. //Nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ purāṇaḥ. Nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ purāṇaḥ.// Very old, but still, it is eternal and fresh. This is spiritual matter. You read //Bhagavad-gītā.// It was spoken four hundred millions of years ago, and then again, five thousand years ago. Still, if you read //Bhagavad-gītā// daily, you will find it fresh. You will never find it old. As Kṛṣṇa is never old, //advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam// [Bs. 5.33]---Kṛṣṇa is the //purāṇa,// the oldest man---but //nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// But He is always... See. You will find Kṛṣṇa just a young boy of twenty years. //Nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// So similarly, Kṛṣṇa's words, everything Kṛṣṇa, absolute. His name, His form, His quality, His activities---they are all fresh and new. Otherwise, how the devotees can glorify the same Kṛṣṇa daily with greater enthusiasm? Greater enthusiasm. The more you glorify, you'll feel more enthusiastic to more glorify, glorify, glorify.

This is spiritual. In the material world, if you speak one thing once, twice, thrice, four times, then it becomes disgusting. But how this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra...// You are chanting. You can chant twenty-four hours. It will feel fresh and enthusiasm. That is spiritual. Therefore... Therefore it is not a subject matter..., this sound is not like this radio, material sound. It is also sound, but it is spiritual sound, and it is coming from the spiritual world. Just like in the material world we can release some sound---from here, it can be heard from thousands of miles, but not more than that. The spiritual sound, it is released from many, many millions and millions and trillions of miles away, still it can be heard, provided you have got the machine to capture it. That is //bhāgavata-prema.//

So those who have got..., developed love of Godhead, they can hear. As it is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa says that "I am speaking to you the old message, //Bhagavad-gītā,// which I spoke to sun-god some millions of years ago." So "Why You are speaking to me? I am not a Vedāntist. I am not a //sannyāsī.// I am not any advance in spiritual understanding." People may say. But Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes. You are My //bhakta.//" //Bhakto 'si.// Therefore to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// means one has to become first of all a //bhakta.// The so-called nondevotee, atheist class, scholar and politician, they cannot understand. It is not possible. They cannot enter into it. The same thing, licking up the honey bottle, that's all. What you will taste? It is not possible. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

The same example can be... You can go to a person who knows how to open the bottle of honey. Then you can taste. Otherwise, if you simply lick up the book, //Bhagavad-gītā,// becoming a very big scholar, you will never taste it. You will never taste it. You can satisfy yourself, "Now I am licking up daily //Bhagavad-gītā,// thrice," but what you will understand unless you are a devotee? You will not understand. The bottle is packed up.

So here it is said, //paśyanti te me rucirāṇy amba santaḥ.// "They can see Me, //santaḥ.//" Not these rascals and fools. They cannot see. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]], Bhagavān says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that "I am not exposed to these fools and rascals, nondevotees." Why I say "fools and rascals" to the nondevotees? I am not saying; Kṛṣṇa says. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. //Mūḍha// means rascal. //Mūḍha// means rascal. And //duṣkṛtinaḥ, duṣkṛtinaḥ// mean always engaged in sinful activities, no restraint. They can eat everything, they can drink everything, they can do everything, without any restriction. They think, "What is that in drinking and eating in the matter of religion?" That is the new invention of //svāmīs// and //yogīs,// that "You can do everything, and still you become advanced."

But that is not possible. One has to become a pure //brāhmaṇa.// Then why, in the Vedic civilization, a pure //brāhmaṇa// is so respected? Because they are symbolic representation of the //Vedas. Satyaṁ śamo damas titikṣā ārjavaṁ jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. That is //brāhmaṇa,// who has got this qualification, //satyam,// who has taken the Absolute Truth as the aim of life. People, ordinary people, how they will know? //Satyaṁ śaucam,// very clean always, //tri-sandhyā-snāna,// taking bathing thrice. //Satyaṁ śaucaṁ śamam,// controlling the mind, not that "I am servant of my mind. I shall do whatever my mind dictates." These are the qualification of //brāhmaṇa. Śamaṁ, damam,// controlling the senses. These are the symbolic representation of the //Vedas.//

So therefore //satāṁ prasaṅgān,// that one has to discuss about the Supreme Personality of Godhead amongst the //satām, santaḥ. Satām, santaḥ,// the same thing. //Santaḥ.// Here the word is used, //santaḥ. Paśyanti me, te me rucirāṇy amba:// "Mother, they can see, //santaḥ.//" //Santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti.// In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// again this word is used, //santaḥ.//

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.38]

So the Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, Śyāmasundara, is meant for the //santa,// not for the //narādhamas, duṣkṛtina, mūḍhas.// They cannot understand. One has to qualify himself to be sinless. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtinaḥ...// This is said, and another paragraph is there, //yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām:// "Those who are completely free from sinful activities," //yeṣāṁ tu anta-gatam,// "no more touch with sinful life," //te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]], "they can fix up their devotional service to Kṛṣṇa." It is not so easy. But one can become immediately a //santa,// within a second.

How? That also, Kṛṣṇa says, that,

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi...
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

The qualification is: unless one is sinless, he cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. He cannot understand what is //kṛṣṇa-bhajana.// But if one is eager---he's actually very eager---he can do it immediately. What is that? Surrender to Kṛṣṇa. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya:// give up all these nonsense so-called religious principle. Simply surrender to Kṛṣṇa, "Kṛṣṇa, I was forgotten about You. Now I surrender unto You fully. If You like, You can kill me; if You like, You can give me protection." This is surrender, not business: "Kṛṣṇa, if You give me this nice thing, then I will surrender." That is not surrender. That is business.

When Prahlāda Mahārāja was offered benediction that "My dear Prahlāda, you have suffered so much for Me even from your father. Now your enemies are all off. You can ask any benediction you like," Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "What is this, my dear Lord? Am I a //bāniyā, vaṇik,// that because I have suffered for You, I shall ask some benediction? No, no, don't offer me like that. Because You are the supreme powerful, whatever I want, I can get from You. And I am born in the //asura// families. I am inclined for this material enjoyment. So don't delude me, my dear Sir. Then I can ask You. And why shall I ask You? Because I have seen my father, so powerful even the demigods were afraid of him, and You have finished all his power within a second. So why shall I ask for these things? Kindly engagement in the service of Your servant. This much I want. I don't want anything."

Therefore a devotee never asks anything material from the Supreme Personality. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taught us, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. They are simply satisfied by glorifying the Lord. That is their only satisfaction. If they get the opportunity of glorifying the Lord, as it is said in the previous verse, that //sabhājayante mama pauruṣāṇi...// [[books:sb:3:25:34|[SB 3.25.34]]]. //Mama pauruṣāṇi,// the glorious activities of the Lord. This is the way of //bhajana. Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. This is the way of //bhakti-yoga.// Simply glorify this... Your glorification, so much activities... Kṛṣṇa therefore comes to give advantage to the devotees for glorifying Him---because He acts. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. To kill the demons and to give protection to the //sādhus,// He has to work. From the very beginning of Kṛṣṇa's birth, the enemies are there, demons are there. Kaṁsa advised his, I mean to say, constables, "So be very careful. As soon as there is Kṛṣṇa's birth, immediately inform me, and I shall kill Him." He was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, a first-class Kṛṣṇa conscious, always, but to kill Him.

Similarly, you will find there are so-called religionists, their only purpose, so-called scholars, their only purpose is how to kill Kṛṣṇa. You will find so many commentaries by the politician, by the so-called scholars, but their only aim is how to kill Kṛṣṇa, how to take away Kṛṣṇa from //Bhagavad-gītā.// No mention of //Bhagavad-gītā...,// of Kṛṣṇa. They will talk so many nonsense, but they will never say that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and He should be worshiped." They will never say. That means //asuras. Āsuraṁ bhāvam āś... Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ, māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. "Oh, they are very big, big scholars, sir. You are talking about them as //mūḍhāḥ, narādhamāḥ?//" Yes. Because although they are so-called scholars, their real knowledge has been taken away. //Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.// Why this punishment, that their knowledge has been taken away? //Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.// "They are simply thinking of killing Me, that's all." How to evade //kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// that is their whole propaganda.

So we should not be like that. If we want to be fixed up, then, in devotional service, then, as it is advised by Kapiladeva... He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead incarnate. He says, //paśyanti te me rucirāṇy amba santaḥ:// "They can see that..." So unless God has got form, how one can see? How God can be //nirākāra?// God is never //nirākāra,// but He's //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.// His //ākāra// is not like us. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. His form is //sac-cid-ānanda.// This body is not //sac-cid-ānanda. Sat// means eternal, and //cit// means full of knowledge, and //ānanda// means full of bliss. So if we study, "Is our body eternal?" No, sir. It is temporary, say, fifty years, sixty years, utmost hundred years. So it is not eternal, it is not //sat. Asat. Asato mā sad gama,// the Vedic injunction, that "Don't keep yourself in this //asat// body. Just get your original //sat// body, eternal body." We are not interested. We are simply interested with this temporary body: "I am this body." I am not this body. I am spirit soul. I am within this body. This is knowledge. This is called //siddhi.// So long I am thinking, "I am this body," then I am cats and dogs. They are thinking like that. But when I know that "I am not this body. I am the spirit spark, spirit soul. I am encaged within this body," that is knowledge. That is knowledge. So those who are self-realized spirit soul, they can see.

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

That //bhakti// means they can see God, Kṛṣṇa, and they can serve Him. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Bhakti// means to engage your senses, //hṛṣīka,// in the service of the Hṛṣīkeśa. That is //bhakti.//

So here it is said, //paśyanti te me rucirāṇi.// Kṛṣṇa is so beautiful, //rucirāṇi. Rucira// means very attractive. Now, fortunately, people in Bombay say that our Deity here is more beautiful. They say there is no such Deity in Bombay city. So this is our duty, to dress Kṛṣṇa in such an attractive way that people at least see that it is very beautiful. Then he becomes a devotee, simply by appreciating. Simply by appreciating, if they say, "Now the Deity worship is very nice," then they go a step forward, step forward immediately, simply by appreciation. Then other things will come gradually. Therefore the temple worship should be exactly to the routine, to the instruction of the //śāstra// and //guru// and //ācārya,// so that the worshiper in the temple as well as the visitor, both of them will benefit. They will be gradually seeing.

Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He has consented to appear in a way so that we can see. At the present moment we cannot see Kṛṣṇa as He is spiritually embodied, //sad-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ,// because we have no eyes to see //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. So here is also //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ, arcā-mūrti.// It is not idol worship. The atheist class may say so, but it is not so. Those who have got eyes, they can see. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He entered the temple of Jagannātha, immediately He fainted: "Oh, here is My Lord. Here is My Lord." So one has to become //santaḥ.// Then one can see. But it is culture, by culture. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva// [Bs. 5.38]. When you develop that culture, when you develop that love for Kṛṣṇa, then you will see immediately and you will faint: "Oh, here is my Lord."

So //prasanna-vaktra aruṇa-locanāni. Prasanna-vaktra. Prasanna// means pleasing. Somebody was talking that "Your Deity is just like trying to talk with me." //Prasanna-vaktra.// Yes. He is here to talk with you, but He is waiting whether you're interested to talk with Him. That's all. Kṛṣṇa says that //teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. He talks, but with whom? //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām.// One who is twenty-four hours engaged with love and faith in the service of the Lord. To whom. Just like if you want to talk with some big man, then you must have qualification. Is it possible that if you want to talk with the big man here, immediately you like? No. You cannot talk. You must be fit to talk with him. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is ready to talk with you. He has come. He has descended in //arcā-mūrti// to talk with you, to be visible by you. Now you make yourself ready and fit to talk with you; then He will exchange conversation. //Santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti.// This is possible. This is a qualification.

So //rūpāṇi divyāni vara-pradāni. Divyāni. Divya// means divine. //Divyāni.// Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, janma karma ca me divyam// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. //Divyam.// They are not material things. One has to see. So if you say, as it is said, //sākaṁ vācaṁ spṛhaṇīyāṁ vadanti. Spṛhaṇīyām,// very favorably you talk... Suppose if I say, "You have no eyes. You are blind," this is not favorable. So the nondevotees, Māyāvādīs, they say that God has no eyes. So it is indirectly saying, "God is blind." So if I say, "You are blind. You nonsense, you are blind," is it favorably talking? Most unfavorable. Directly insulting. So those who are talking about God, //nirākāra//---no eyes, no leg, no head, no tail, nothing, //nirākāra//---they are simply blaspheming, not //spṛhaṇīyām.// God does not want to hear such nonsense things. Therefore it is said, //sākaṁ vācaṁ spṛhaṇīyāṁ vadanti.// You cannot say that "Kṛṣṇa is blind. Kṛṣṇa is lame. Kṛṣṇa has no hands. Kṛṣṇa has no nothing, nothing," indirectly saying, "Kṛṣṇa has..., does not exist." This kind of addressing Kṛṣṇa, //nirākāra,// is not favorable talking with Kṛṣṇa.

Favorable talking---if you want to talk with Kṛṣṇa, then you must consult the Vedic literature how Kṛṣṇa is worshiped.

> veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ
> barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam
> kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.30]

"My Lord, Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, is playing on His flute." //Veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣam// [Bs. 5.30]: "His eyes are just like petals of the lotus flower." //Aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ barhāvataṁsam:// "Oh, He has some nice peacock feather." These are the Vedic description of Kṛṣṇa, not that the devotees have imagined some... Just like Māyāvādī says, "Just imagine the form of God." God's form cannot be imagined. That is not God. Anything imagination is not fact. It must be factual. And the factual information you get from the //Vedas.// Not only you get the //Vedas;// when Kṛṣṇa was present on this earth He exhibited His //rūpa,// His form, His activities, His //līlā.// Everything He exhibited so kindly. So you have to think of this //kṛṣṇa-līlā,// Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's activities. //Janma karma ca me divyam// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. They are divine. They are not material, because Kṛṣṇa has got divine body, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. But to favor us, because devotees are always anxious to see, therefore He comes.

When Kṛṣṇa said, //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām, sambhavāmi yuge yuge...// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. He comes for two business. First business is //paritrāṇāya sādhūnām.// The //sādhus,// the //santas,// or the devotees, they are always, I mean to say, given trouble by this atheistic class of men. So therefore they have no other means. They simply think of Kṛṣṇa. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. Even his father was giving him trouble, so much trouble that he was..., he wanted to kill him somehow or other. So they... Here, the //santas,// they come. They have to suffer so much trouble by the demons. Therefore we have already discussed that verse that, what is that? //Titikṣavaḥ. Titikṣavaḥ kāruṇikāḥ// [[books:sb:3:25:21|[SB 3.25.21]]]. A //santa// means he has to suffer. Just see in the Western countries the Lord Jesus Christ. He was preaching about God, God consciousness. That was the only fault, and he was crucified. Just see. He was crucified. The state ordered him to be crucified because he is talking. Similarly, Hiraṇyakaśipu, his five-years-old boy, he was talking only of Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa. So therefore his father became enemy. He was trying in so many ways to kill him.

This is the very old story, that if you become a devotee, you must be prepared to be put into miserable condition by the demons. That is their business. //Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. //Asuras...// Just like even Kṛṣṇa, even God Himself, He was attempted to be killed by Kaṁsa. Not only that; He engaged so many demons---Pūtanā, Aghāsura, Bakāsura, Mahīśāsura, so many //asuras.// But Kṛṣṇa is always Kṛṣṇa. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.// He is able to finish these //duṣkṛtas// or the //asuras// by His omnipotency. That He can do. But the //asuras// are always. Their only business is to give trouble to God and His devotee.

Therefore it is advised, //titikṣavaḥ kāruṇikāḥ suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām// [[books:sb:3:25:21|[SB 3.25.21]]]. A devotee should be so advanced that in spite of being troubled by the //asuras,// he should tolerate, //titikṣavaḥ,// and still he should be kind upon him, not that "This man is talking against me, against God. Therefore I shall be angry and drive him away." No. //Titikṣavaḥ kāruṇikāḥ.// Everyone in this material world, more or less, they are //asuras,// atheists. So if you want to preach, then you have to learn tolerance and speak in such a way that these //asura// can become also devotee. That is the business.

So here it is said that //sākaṁ vācaṁ spṛhaṇīyāṁ vadanti.// So we should pray in such a way Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //spṛhaṇīyām.// Don't think He is dead stone. That is the conclusion of the atheist class of men. No, dead, no. You talk in such a way that He will be pleased upon you. He will be pleased. He is pleased, He is satisfied in Himself, but He wants to see that you are also talking about Him pleasingly. That's all. Therefore He comes. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām.// You talk unpleasingly or pleasingly, it doesn't matter to Kṛṣṇa. But if you talk pleasingly, then you become benefited. You become benefited. So therefore there are //stotra.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa's another name is Uttamaśloka. //Uttamaśloka// means He is worshiped, God is worshiped, by the best selected words, not patchy words. No. All selected words. So you will find in so many prayers, not only in our Vedic scripture and other scripture also, in Bible, in Koran, the prayer. Prayer is also devotion. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam, arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. //Vandanam,// this //vandanam.// The Christians and the Muhammadans, they offer //vandanam.// Although they do not worship the Deity, but they offer prayers to the Lord. That is also good. That is also //bhakti.//

//Arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-ni...// There are nine different processes. So you accept all of them or some of them or at least one. Then your life is successful. //Spṛhayanti.// Very selected words. You surrender to Him, but don't talk things which does not please Him. You don't say that "God is formless. God has no eyes, no leg, no head." These things are there. Just like in the //Vedas// it is said, //apāṇi-pādo javano grahītā,// that "He has no hand, but He can accept your offerings." But if He has no hand, then how He can offer your offerings, er, how He can accept your offerings? He has His hand, but not like our hand. He can extend His hand millions of miles. Just like Kṛṣṇa leaves His Goloka, Goloka Vṛndāvana. That planet is many millions and trillions of miles away, but He can accept what you offer. That is Kṛṣṇa's hand. Not like Your hand, three feet. No. Therefore sometimes in the //Vedas// it is said that "God has no hand." That means He has no this material hand. But He can accept your offerings. That means He has got hand, but that is a different type. That is explained, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1].

So in this way we have to study the science of God, the science of Kṛṣṇa. Then our life will be successful. And //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. And if we can understand Kṛṣṇa's activities, Kṛṣṇa..., Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's quality, then we become fit for going back to home, back to Godhead. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti...// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
