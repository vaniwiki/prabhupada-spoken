====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.26.7 ======

**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.] [break]

> tad asya saṁsṛtir bandhaḥ
> pāra-tantryaṁ ca tat-kṛtam

"Material consciousness is the cause of one's conditional life. Conditions are enforced upon the living entity by the material energy. Although he does not do anything and is transcendental to such activities, the spirit soul is thus affected by conditional life."

**Prabhupāda:**

> tad asya saṁsṛtir bandhaḥ
> pāra-tantryaṁ ca tat-kṛtam
> bhavaty akartur īśasya
> sākṣiṇo nirvṛtātmanaḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:7|[SB 3.26.7]]]

So //karmasu kriyamāṇeṣu guṇair ātmani manyate// [[books:sb:3:26:6|[SB 3.26.6]]]. The conditioned soul... We say "conditioned." It was not conditioned, but now it has become conditioned, //pāra-tantrya.//

> kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva anādi-bahirmukha
> ataeva māyā tāre deya saṁsāra-duḥkha
> [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]]

This is a statement in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Kṛṣṇa bhuliyā,// forgetting Kṛṣṇa, //jīva,// the living entity, //anādi-bahirmukha... Anādi... Ādi// means the beginning of the creation, and //anādi// means before the creation. //Anādi.// Nobody knows when it has began. The creation... There are many creations. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. Just like this body: it is created, everyone knows. It is created by the father and mother. And it will be annihilated in due course of time by nature's way. Similarly, anything material... This whole universe, cosmic manifestation, is also created. This is a bigger body, that's all, //virāṭ// body. And it stays for millions and millions of years during the lifetime of Brahmā. We have got information, Brahmā's one day: //sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ// [[books:bg:8:17|[Bg. 8.17]]]. We cannot calculate even one Brahmā's days. Such one day means daytime, twelve hours; then night, twelve hours. In this one day, such month, such year, such hundred years, Brahmā lives. So this cosmic manifestation, //brahmāṇḍa,// universe, will stay up to that time. So there is no difference in the manipulation with this body and the Brahmā. It is the same principle. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate.// So this is //saṁsṛtiḥ, anādi-bahirmukha.//

So this creation... Not only this creation... We are in this material world. Maybe... "Maybe" not; it is a fact that we have been in many other creations. Therefore our this forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa is called //anādi. Anādi// means before creation. This creation is going on. Before that, there was another creation. The same thing was going on. Now, this is called //saṁsṛtiḥ, saṁsāra, saṁsāra-bandhana,// bound up by //saṁsṛtiḥ. Anādi karama-phale, paḍi' bhavārṇava-jale.// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings, "On account of my fruitive result before the beginning of the creation, I am now in this material ocean." //Anādi karma-phale, paḍi' bhavārṇava-jale taribāre nā dekhi upāy:// "I do not find any means how to get out of it." This is knowledge. When one becomes very anxious, very serious to get out of this //saṁsṛtiḥ,// continually going on, birth and death, birth and death, birth... People have no knowledge. So //tad asya saṁsṛtir bandhaḥ.// This is bondage.

The previous verse, it has been described,

> karmasu kriyamāṇeṣu
> guṇair ātmani manyate
> evaṁ parābhidhyānena
> kartṛtvaṁ prakṛteḥ pumān
> [[books:sb:3:26:6|[SB 3.26.6]]]

Dictated by the material nature, we are acting in some way and thereby creating another resultant action, means another body. In this way it is going on. That is called //saṁsṛtiḥ. Tad asya saṁsṛtir bandhaḥ pāra-tantryam. Svātantrya,// and just the opposite word is //pāra-tantrya,// "under the direction of somebody else," //pāra-tantrya.// Just like dog and the master. The dog is //pāra-tantrya,// dependent on the master. Similarly, we are now dogs of material nature, //pāra-tantrya.// We cannot go beyond the rules and regulation, condition, of material nature. That is called //pāra-tantrya,// not //svātantrya.// Just like they are trying to go to the moon planet, but because they are under condition of material nature, not that they can go very easily. It is not possible. They are coming back, again and again trying to go there. This is also material world. Even in this material world we are so much dependent on the rules and regulation of the nature. And what to speak of going to the spiritual world? //Pāra-tantrya// is there, we admit or not admit. We are not //svātantrya,// or independent. We are dependent. //Bhavaty akartur īśasya sākṣiṇo nirvṛtātmanaḥ.//

So we are conditioned soul, but the Supersoul... The Māyāvādī philosopher, they do not admit the existence of Supersoul. They think there is one soul. We are... They speak of our conditioned life as //līlā.// This is not very good philosophy. One has got the body of a hog, and he is eating stool, and the Māyāvādī philosopher says that it is //līlā.// God is eating stool; it is //līlā.// Just see the philosophy! Because we say //kṛṣṇa-līlā...// Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is dancing with the //gopīs// or playing with the cowherds boy or becoming the child of Mother Yaśodā. We say it is //līlā.// The Māyāvādī philosopher says... Because they do not..., two, make two. Their philosophy is one. So the pig or the hog eating the stool, they say it is also //līlā.// Kṛṣṇa is dancing with the //gopīs,// that is also //līlā,// and because they do not make two, therefore... We cannot say, of course. They say that God is also..., has become pig, and they, eating stool, that is also //līlā.// This is the grossest offense on the feet of the Lord, to bring Him to the status of ordinary living being who is not independent. Dependent, it is clearly said. Therefore they manufacture these words, "//daridra-nārāyaṇa,//" "this Nārāyaṇa," "that Nārāyaṇa," because they do not make any difference between Nārāyaṇa and the ordinary living entity. This is their philosophy.

But that is not the fact. Here it is said, //tad asya saṁsṛtir bandhaḥ pāra-tantryaṁ ca tat-kṛtam. Pāra-tantrya,// "under the grip of the laws of material nature." How God can be under the grip of material nature? They explain, "It is //līlā.//" But that is not. Here it is said, //pāra-tantrya:// "He is forced to accept a certain type of body." That is called //pāra-tantrya. Saṁsṛtiḥ.// This is punishment, //saṁsṛtiḥ.// Why //saṁsṛtiḥ?// On account of... [aside:] What is that? Sit down. //Saṁsṛtiḥ. Saṁsṛtiḥ// means punishment. //Samyak rūpeṇa sṛtiḥ,// going, progress, one after another, one after another, one after another, //saṁsṛtiḥ, saṁsāra.// So //saṁsāra// is not very palatable thing. Our Vaiṣṇava //ācāryas// say that //saṁsāra// is just like blazing fire. It is not a very nice... Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. So does it mean that the Supreme Lord, the Absolute Personality of Godhead, He has come to suffer? And by force everyone in this material world is suffering //saṁsṛtiḥ,// and he is the Supreme Personality of Godhead? How wrong philosophy it is. No.

In the //Bhagavad-gītā,// in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is not possible to make the one. No. Kṛṣṇa says, //mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]: "//Jīva// is My //aṁśa,// part, particle, very small particle." And Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Lord, He is //vibhu.// We have discussed all this. //Vibhu,// greater than the greatest, and smaller than the smallest. The smaller than the smallest... //Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 1.2.20]. //Mahato mahīyān// is the Supreme Lord, and we are //aṇu,// very small particle, although we are the same expansion of the Supreme. But both, we are individual, not that today we are differentiated, and when we are liberated we become one. No. That is not. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātanaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. //Sanātanaḥ// means eternally we are //vibhinnāṁśa.//

So our this //pāra-tantrya,// dependence on material nature, is //pāra-tantryaṁ ca tat-kṛtam. Tat-kṛtam.// And we wanted this separation. Therefore it is our conditioned life here. That is our selection. //Kṛṣṇa-bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare.// When we wanted to enjoy life independently, so-called ind... Because we cannot be independent. We have to become dependent, either this material nature or the spiritual nature. It is not possible. Therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. You have to take //āśraya,// shelter, of either of the //prakṛtis, parā-prakṛti// or //aparā-prakṛti. Aparā-prakṛti// is this material nature, and //parā-prakṛti// is the spiritual nature. So therefore //jīva-śakti// is called //taṭasthā. Taṭasthā. Antaraṅga, bahiraṅga, taṭasthā. Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya// 13.65, //purport//]. The Absolute Truth has got multi-potencies. They have been summarized into three. First is //parā-prakṛti,// spiritual nature, and then the material nature, and another nature, //prakṛti//---we are also //prakṛti//---between the two, //taṭasthā.// Just like the beach is between the land and water. Beach is sometimes covered with water and sometimes it is uncovered; the water is far away. When it is not covered, we call it beach, and it is covered, we call it sea. So similarly, our position is like that, living entities. Although by nature we are //parā-prakṛti,// spirit, spirit, but because we have got the tendency to enjoy material nature, therefore we come to this material nature. Therefore our position is in between the spiritual nature and the material nature, //taṭasthā. Taṭasthā// means in between.

So because we have selected this //pāra-tantrya,// to be conditioned by the material nature, in any condition we are dependent, either dependent on spiritual nature or on material nature. So if we prefer to be under the control of material nature, then it is //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. And if we are under spiritual nature, then... //Asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ. Raso vai saḥ, labdhānandī// [Taittirīya Upaniṣad 2.7.1]. Then we get blissful life, eternal blissful life. That is our selection. Either you be under spiritual nature or you be under material nature. That we have got, little independence, as you like. //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. Kṛṣṇa said. Kṛṣṇa is very kind. If you want to remain in the material nature and enjoy so-called material sense gratification, then you can have it.

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is explained,

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtejyā yānti bhūtāni
> mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

If you want to remain in this material world, //bhūtejyā,// worshiper of the material energy... Just like we are at present engaged: we are worshiper of the material energy, or Durgā. Worshiper of the material energy. In the Durgā-pūjā, in the //Caṇḍi,// the direction is that you ask material opulence, //dhanaṁ dehi, rūpaṁ dehi, rūpavatī-bhāryāṁ dehi, yaśo dehi.// That you can do. And we all, living entities within this material world, we are worshiper of the material nature. The scientist also trying to find out means how to exploit the resources of material nature. That is also one kind of worshiping. Because if they are successful in discovering some material energy, new kind of material energy, they get money. Then, by money, they get full advantage of sense gratification. So this is called conditioned life, conditioned by the material..., illusioned by the material... They are trying, discover material advances, and becoming happy by such advancement. This is called material life. This is //pāra-tantrya.// This is not //svātantrya. Pāra-tantrya.// Although constitutionally the living entity is //svātantrya, asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ,// but because we accepted to be satisfied under the control of material nature, that is called //pāra-tantrya,// and that is called //saṁsṛtiḥ. Saṁsṛtiḥ// means continuously repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. That is called //saṁsāra.//

Therefore Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, he says, //saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka.// This //saṁsṛtiḥ,// this repetition of birth and death and different standard of material happiness... Everybody has got some material happiness. The man has got a standard of material happiness. The dog has got a standard of material happiness. The demigods, they have got a standard of material happiness. Everyone has got. So... But actually, it is not happiness. It is simply miserable condition. And because we do not appreciate this miserable condition, we still think that we are happy. That is called //māyā,// illusion. This is called //saṁsṛtiḥ.// Although we are in a miserable condition, continually, every moment, every second... This place is like that. Kṛṣṇa says, not that we are saying. Kṛṣṇa says //duḥkhālayam.// Continually you have to suffer. But we are..., we have become so much habituated in this suffering, we do not accept it as suffering. We take it as very pleasing, because we have no idea what is actually happiness. //Sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriyaṁ grāhyam// [[books:bg:6:20-23|[Bg. 6.21]]]. Real happiness... What is real happiness? //Sukhaṁ yat.// Then what is //sukham?// That is not to be appreciated by these material senses. //Sukham ātyantikam. Ātyantikam// means supreme. This is not... Whatever so-called happiness we derive in this material world, that is dependent on so many conditions. That is not //ātyantikam. Ātyantikam// means the supreme happiness. That is different from this material happiness. But we have no information or taste because we have been conditioned for many, many creation, //anādi.// Just like a man suffering from disease from many, many years, he becomes accustomed. He does not take any more that this suffering is suffering. He thinks this is natural.

So we have been accustomed to this habit of material disadvantages. We have no information of spiritual life. Therefore //śāstra// says that we should try... This life, human life, is not meant for suffering but to make endeavor to end suffering. That is human life. Human life is not meant for suffering like the animals. Just like the life of pig. Is that very good life? Whole day and night they are searching after stool, "Where is stool? Where is stool?" because that is their enjoyment. Actually, if you give a pig //halavā// and, side by side, stool, he would prefer to accept the stool than the //halavā// because he is habituated to that kind of food. Therefore Ṛṣabhadeva says that human life... He was instructing to His sons, "My dear sons, don't be like pigs. You just become like human being." //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]: "My dear sons, don't try to get happiness like the pigs, dogs, hogs." //Kaṣṭān kāmān.// With hard labor you get some food, and then you enjoy sex life. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Material life means to work very hard day and night and get some money and then eat sumptuously. Eat, drink, be merry and then enjoy sex life. That's all. So Ṛṣabhadeva said, "My dear sons, this kind of standard of life is available in the life of pigs." //Kaṣṭān kāmān arhate ye viḍ-bhujām. Viḍ-bhujām// means stool-eaters.

Then what is human life? If this is not life, then what is real life? That, He recommends, //tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Sattva,// your //sattva,// your existence, is now impure. It is covered by this material nature; therefore it is impure. So you have to purify. That is real life. And to purify means //tapasya. Tapo divyam. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. That is the way. That is Vedic civilization. That is Vedic civilization, or you may call Indian civilization or Hindu civilization. Actually, it is Vedic civilization. Therefore you will find in India, in the history of India, //Mahābhārata,// greater India, that many people, they are engaged in //tapasya.// A part of life must be engaged for //tapasya.// The Bharata Mahārāja, Bharata Mahārāja, under whose name this planet is called Bhārata-varṣa... So you will find in the Fifth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// his life. He enjoyed his kingdom, then voluntarily he left. After the end of his material way of life, he divided the property to his sons and left. And he was living alone at Pulahāśrama near Haridwar, and undergoing severe //tapasya.// That is human life, to accept //tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvaṁ yasmād brahma-saukhyam anantam.// You are searching after happiness, but why don't you see that in this material life your happiness is conditioned? That is not easily going or flowing. There are so many condition. If you have to become a millionaire, before becoming millionaire there are so many condition. So this is not happiness. After going through so many conditions, and which we get, that is also not for good.

So to come to the so-called conditional happiness we have to undergo so many difficulties, and when we come to that position... Suppose after working very, very hard I get one million dollars, so I will not be allowed to enjoy this one million dollar for all the days. //Aśāśvatam. Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. Kṛṣṇa says that this place is full of miseries. To get that one million dollar you have to undergo so many miserable condition of life. And even if you get it... Perhaps you may not get it. Everyone is trying, but they cannot... Everyone is not getting. Who is destined to get, he is getting, not that everyone, because he..., one is trying very hard, it is guaranteed that he will get one million dollar. That is not possible. That one who is to get by destiny. This is the //śāstra.// Actually, this is the fact.

Therefore Vedic civilization does not recommend that you waste your valuable life simply for so-called happiness or economic..., improvement of economic condition. Because it is not possible that everyone trying for improving economic condition and everyone is becoming millionaire. No. That is not possible. You cannot get more or less what you are destined to get. Otherwise, everyone would have been millionaires---everyone. In Bombay there are so many. People are trying, working very hard at day and night. Still, somebody is living in a very nice, palatial building and somebody is living in the //jhupaṛa,// or what is that, most abominable condition, in Bombay city. Why? Because one is destined.

Therefore //śāstra// says that don't bother about these thing. //Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]]. For that reason one should work, which is not obtainable by wandering, //bhramatām upary adhaḥ. Upary adhaḥ.// What is that? That thing is that purifying your existence. //Tasyaiva hetoḥ,// for that reason. Purifying means, as we have discussed many //ślokas,// we are now covered by this material nature, //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa,// and our endeavor should be how to purify. //Tapo divyam. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvam.// Just to purify our existence. And as soon as we purify our existence, //yasmād brahma-saukhyam anantam. Brahma-sukha.// Brahman means the largest, or eternal. Here the //sukha,// or happiness, is not //brahma-sukha;// that is material //sukha.// Therefore, in another place it is said, //ramante yoginaḥ anante// [[books:cc:madhya:9:29|[Cc. Madhya 9.29]]]. The //yogīs,// those who are //yogīs... Yogī// especially means //bhakta-yogī.// They also enjoy. //Ramante yoginaḥ anante.// That is unlimited enjoyment, without any stoppage. //Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. Simply increasing, increasing. There is no decrease. That is called //ananta.// It is increasing. Just like Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa and the //gopīs,// they are also in pleasure. //Gopīs// are expansion of Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. So they are increasing their pleasure. There is no decrease. In the material world there is no question of increasing; it is decreasing. That is the difference.

Therefore, those who are //yogīs,// they are also enjoying. //Ramante yoginaḥ anante satyānande.// That is real happiness, which increases. Which decreases, that is not real happiness. That is illusion. //Ramante yoginaḥ anante satyānande cid-ātmana. Cit,// that is spiritual, spiritual //ānanda.// Really we want //ānanda,// happiness, blissfulness. That is our natural instinct. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. So... But we are searching after //ānanda// in this material world, and that is described here that //saṁsṛtir bandhaḥ pāra-tantrya,// under material condition and changing this body one after another. This is not //ānanda. Satyānande cid-ātmani. Ānanda// is available on the spiritual platform. //Satyānande cid-ātmani. Ramante... Iti rāma-padenāsau paraṁ brahma iti abhidhīyate// [[books:cc:madhya:9:29|[Cc. Madhya 9.29]]]. Therefore the //yogīs,// they enjoy, //ramaṇa,// in the spiritual world. That //ānanda// is called Rāma, Hare Rāma, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is also attractive, and Rāma is enjoyment. So when we dovetail our activities with Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, then our life becomes happy. Before that there is //saṁsṛtiḥ.//

Therefore in order to understand the science, one has to go... That is the Vedic injunction, //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]: "One should approach a proper, bona fide spiritual master." And the spiritual master will save him from this blazing fire of repetition of birth and death. Therefore Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura sings,

> saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-
> trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam
> prāptasya kalyāṇa-guṇārṇavasya
> vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam

It is the business of the //guru,// to deliver this disciple, //śiṣya,// from this blazing fire of //saṁsāra, saṁsṛti, bandha,// conditioned life, to save him from that position and give him the eternal happiness, //brahma-saukhyam anantam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]].

Thank you very much.
