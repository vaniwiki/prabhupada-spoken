//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

"Egoism in the mode of passion produces two kinds of senses---the senses for acquiring knowledge and the senses of action. The senses of action depend upon the vital energy, and the senses for acquiring knowledge depend upon intelligence."

**Prabhupāda:**

> taijasānīndriyāṇy eva
> kriyā-jñāna-vibhāgaśaḥ
> prāṇasya hi kriyā-śaktir
> buddher vijñāna-śaktitā
> [[books:sb:3:26:31|[SB 3.26.31]]]

We have to see how wonderfully the subtle actions are described in Sāṅkhya philosophy by Kapiladeva. There are many modern psychologist, scientist, physist, but they cannot analyze the subtle function that is going on, creating things as they are. Superficially we can see, but how things are taking place, that can be described in the Vedic literatures, not any other book. Therefore it is said, //vidyā bhāgavatāvadhiḥ:// "One who has studied //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// thoroughly, he has seen the end of knowledge." And actually, //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the commentary, or explanation, on the //Vedānta-sūtra.// Vyāsadeva made //Vedānta-sūtra,// the ultimate knowledge, and he made his comment also, natural commentary. That is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// At the end of every chapter of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// you will find, //brahma-sūtrasya bhāṣya:// "It is the natural comment of //Brahma-sūtra.//" So if we study //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// very thoroughly, and specifically from a person //bhāgavata,// then our life is successful. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. That is the instruction, //nityam.//

Just like here we are having //Bhāgavata// class. This is not ordinary //Bhāgavata// class, not jumping over Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā.// It is not like that. It is step by step studying what is Kṛṣṇa, what is this material world, what is the //sambandha,// or relationship with Kṛṣṇa---so many things---how this body has developed, how we have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, how to revive our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These things must be studied first of all. Then we can understand what is Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with the //gopīs.// But these professional //Bhāgavata// preachers, they go, jump over at once. Because it appears like the dealings of young boys and girls, so that is the... Here in this material world, sex impulse... Here in this material world, sex impulse is the center of all activity. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tucchaṁ kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. People are working so hard day and night. What is their happiness? The happiness is sex, that's all. That has been described as //tuccham,// most abominable. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham. Ataḥ gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]].

So we are not aware what is the aim of life. So Kṛṣṇa is very kind. He therefore comes. He came just before the beginning of this Kali-yuga, the most fallen age, and left for us the //Bhagavad-gītā.// And then, after Him, after His departure... It is said in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// "After departure of Kṛṣṇa from this planet to His own abode, the principle of religion and knowledge, where it is kept?" So the answer is, "It is kept in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//" //Adhunā udita.// So Kṛṣṇa is nondifferent from //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is spoken by Him personally, and He is also represented by //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// sound representation. So we should take the advantage of //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// They are //kṛṣṇa-kathā, kṛṣṇa-kathā. Kṛṣṇa-kathā// means news or words about Kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa's //kathā,// the words given by Kṛṣṇa. That is //Bhagavad-gītā, kṛṣṇa-kathā,// Kṛṣṇa's words. And //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// means words for Kṛṣṇa. Both of them are //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// or //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa,// instruction by Kṛṣṇa.

So here is... Kapiladeva is giving instruction, how things have developed one after another from Kṛṣṇa, from Kapiladeva. Kapiladeva and Kṛṣṇa, there is no difference. You read the purport.

**Nitāi:**
"It has been explained in the previous verses that mind is the product of ego in goodness and that the function of the mind is acceptance and rejection according to desire. But here intelligence is said to be the product of ego in passion. That is the distinction between mind and intelligence; mind is a product of egoism in goodness, and intelligence is a product of egoism in passion. The desire to accept something and reject something is a very important factor of the mind. Since the mind is a product of the mode of goodness, if it is fixed upon the Lord of the mind, Aniruddha, then the mind can be changed to Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, here is the secret of training the mind. The whole //yoga// system, //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// system---//dhyāna, dhāraṇā, āsana, prāṇāyāma,// like that---they are meant for only controlling the mind. Mind is the center of sensual activities. The purpose of //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// is to train up the mind, because the mind is very restless. Arjuna, five hundred years ago, he also appreciated the mind is very restless. So he declined to practice the //haṭha-yoga// system. He said clearly that "Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me to control the mind." In another place in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, "The mind is the most dearmost friend, and mind is the bitterest enemy." Everyone's bitterest enemy and dearest friend is there. That is the mind. It requires little training.

For training the mind, this //yoga// system is. Those who are too much engrossed in the bodily concept of life, for them, this //yoga// system, //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// system, is recommended by practicing a certain type of //āsana// and making a type of exercise of the breathing, in this way, //prāṇāyāma, dhyāna, dhāraṇā, āsana, prāṇāyāma.// But there is another simple method that is recommended in the //śāstra.// You can train up your mind if you simply keep your mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is here, and you see Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, and if you practice to meditate upon Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, Kṛṣṇa's bodily feature, then immediately your mind becomes controlled. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, he was the emperor of the world. He had to manage many political affairs. But he was one of the topmost devotees at the same time. Why? Because... About him it is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that he practiced this //yoga// system, the topmost //yoga// system. What is that? //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ:// "He kept always his mind at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa." And his legs engaged for going... He was king, emperor. He had no business to go. But still, he was using his legs to go to the temple. This is this //yoga// system: you employ your senses. Instead of going to the cinema and standing there for three hours for a ticket, if you engage your legs to come to this temple, it is //yoga// system. So simple thing. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ.// Instead of thinking some beautiful woman or beautiful man, if you think of Kṛṣṇa, the most beautiful person, then it is //yoga// system. So simple.

So every senses you can engage in Kṛṣṇa's service. Just we have got senses, ten senses, and the mind. So mind engaged in Kṛṣṇa, legs engaged for going to the temple, hands engaged for cleansing the temple, nose engaged for smelling the flower offered to Kṛṣṇa or //tulasī// offered to Kṛṣṇa, tongue to taste Kṛṣṇa's //prasādam,// hear Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra//---in this way, you can engage all the senses. There is no need of education. There is no need of passing M.A., Ph.D. You practice this simple //yoga// system: //sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja used to do that. //Vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.// You have to talk, but don't talk nonsense. But you engage your talking about //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā//---//vaikuṇṭha. Vaikuṇṭha// means without any //kuṇṭha,// without any anxiety. Other talking, you will have so many anxieties because that is not //vaikuṇṭha// talking. But if you engage your talking on the subject matter of Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa is talking. Kṛṣṇa is not dumb, deaf and dumb, //nirākāra.// No. He is talking before Kṛṣṇa, //aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]], //aham:// "Here I am. I am the origin of all the //devas.//" So Kṛṣṇa is talking like that. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. He is talking. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:// "Just think of Me. Become My devotee." He is stressing everywhere, a person; //mama,// "unto Me," "My," "I," the first person, everywhere. //Aham ādir hi devānām. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. So these are the talking of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is talking. So you take up this message from Kṛṣṇa directly and engage like that, //vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.// Don't talk nonsense. Or if you talk of Kṛṣṇa, then nonsense talking will stop automatically.

Now you know that in our institution there are so many European boys and girls. In their own country they are very, very much fond of newspaper. If there is no newspaper, they think life is horrible. But you won't find a piece of newspaper in our temple, because they have stopped talking all nonsense. Only this //Bhagavad-gītā, Bhāgavata.// This is called //vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.// They are no more interested with this nonsense talking of the newspaper. //Vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.// This is advancement of spiritual life. I have heard one story from a gentleman, how newspaper is important in Western country. We have seen also, big, big bunch of newspaper thrown in every door. They subscribe. So one priest was preaching among the miners in Sheffield, where there are many coal mines, in England. So he was speaking that "You become devotee, followers of Jesus Christ," and in this way he's preaching Bible. So one of the miners, he never heard of Bible nor Jesus Christ. So he inquired, "What is his number?" That means he thought Christ may be one of the miners, and they have got specific number. So he said, "No, you are mistaking. Jesus Christ is Lord. He is not one of you, like worker. No. He's Lord. So if you don't appreciate him, don't worship him, then you will go to hell." Then another man asked, "What is hell?" And he described that "Hell is very dark. It is very moist," and so on. "There is no air there, no light, and..." So they are living always in the mine. There was no response, because they are habituated with this hellish life. [laughing] So the description of hell did not appeal. Then the priest was intelligent, said, "You know there is no newspaper." Then they said, "Oh, horrible!" [laughter] "It is horrible."

So that newspaper is so important in the Western countries. Even the miners and the most fallen people, they also read newspaper. And these boys and girls who you are seeing, not only here, there also, they don't care any more for any newspaper, any magazine, except //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// This is a fact. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]].

So this is... If we simply do these things, that //vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane,// this //Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// description of Vaikuṇṭha, the transcendental life where there is no anxiety... That is Vaikuṇṭha. So Vaikuṇṭha... God's name is also Vaikuṇṭha. In southern India they say Veṅkateśvara. That is //apabhraṁśa// of Vaikuṇṭheśvara. They say Veṅkateśvara. But Vaikuṇṭheśvara. Vaikuṇṭha, the spiritual world, and the master of the Vaikuṇṭha, He is called Veṅkateśvara or Vaikuṇṭheśvara. So in this way we can train up ourself. Keep your mind always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, as Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// Then you become gradually the first-class //yogī.// You don't require to make any exercise. The..., everything will be done automatically. Kṛṣṇa will give you intelligence. As you concentrate your mind on Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, immediately you become qualified to talk with Kṛṣṇa. Immediately. That is said by Kṛṣṇa in the //Bhagavad-gītā: teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. So Kṛṣṇa is there within your heart, and as soon as you engage yourself in the service of Kṛṣṇa, beginning with //sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]], concentrating your mind, that is the //yoga// system.

Meditation means to concentrate the mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa; not something fictitious, but this is tangible. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. That is the //yoga// practice of meditation, but not that he, the //yogī,// does not know what he is thinking. That is not //yoga.// This is simply show. Real //yoga// is to meditate upon the lotus feel of Kṛṣṇa. That is real //yoga. Dhyānāvasthita. Dhyāna. Dhyāna// means meditation. So they sit down in //dhyāna.// Now what is the subject matter of //dhyāna?// The subject matter of //dhyāna// is the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu. That is //dhyāna, dhyāna-yoga.// That is... Then you get yogic perfection. And Kṛṣṇa recommends in the //Bhagavad-gītā// how first-class //yoga// is thinking of Kṛṣṇa:

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

The first-class //yogī// is.

So actually it is so. As soon as you contact the Supreme, //yoga... Yoga// means contact, and another meaning, everyone knows, in mathematics, //yoga:// one plus one equal to two. And //viyoga:// one minus one equal to zero. //Viyoga, vi-yoga,// discontact, and contact. So we are now separated, separated superficially. "What is God? I don't care for God. I am God," this, that. Therefore //yoga// system is required to connect again your relation, reestablish. It is not broken. It is exactly like that: a boy is away from home for many, many years, so he is now separated or discontact. But immediately he can contact by remembering his father, mother, family, immediately. Immediately the relationship is revived. So //yoga// system means from time immemorial we have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, or God. This is our position. //Kṛṣṇa bhuli' sei jīva anādi-bahirmukha// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]]. Because we have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, //anādi,// before creation, therefore I am looking after external things for my happiness. //Bahir-artha-māninaḥ.//

//Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum, bahir-artha-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. //Bahir-artha-māninaḥ,// those who have been captured by this external energy, //māyā,// material world, they do not know what is their actual interest. The interest is to revive again his relationship with the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. //Na te viduḥ.// They do not know it. And,

> na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ
> durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ
> andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās
> te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ
> [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]

//Andha,// the leaders of this class of man, they are also blind. We are blind, and the leaders, so-called leaders, he also does not know what is the aim of life. And they are misleading us in so many ways by so-called political emancipation, this party, that party, but they do not know actually what is the aim of life. Therefore they are //andhas. Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ.// And we are also //andhas.// So //andha// leading //andha.// So how there can be any peace and prosperity? Therefore the whole world is unhappy, chaotic condition, and everyone is manufacturing his own way of life to become happy. But they are not becoming happy because they do not know what is the aim of life. This is the position.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is at least trying to give the people what is the aim of life, how he can be happy, how he can regain his eternal position of blissful life. These are the things. And they are authorized. What we are presenting, that is nothing manufactured by concoction of the brain. No. It is all authorized, all authorized. So if we take advantage of this movement, then we become happy, we become in the perfect knowledge, blissful life, even in this life, and next life you go back to home, back to Godhead.

Thank you very much.
