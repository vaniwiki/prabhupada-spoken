**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> dravyākṛtitvaṁ guṇatā
> vyakti-saṁsthātvam eva ca
> tejastvaṁ tejasaḥ sādhvi
> rūpa-mātrasya vṛttayaḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:39|[SB 3.26.39]]]

[break] [03:14]

"My dear mother, the characteristics of form are understood by dimension, quality and individuality. The form of fire is appreciated by its effulgence."

**Prabhupāda:**

> dravyākṛtitvaṁ guṇatā
> vyakti-saṁsthātvam eva ca
> tejastvaṁ tejasaḥ sādhvi
> rūpa-mātrasya vṛttayaḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:39|[SB 3.26.39]]]

So little explanation is there. This is the transformation of the elements, how from sky, the air; from air, the fire; fire, water. Everything in that proportion is explained by Sāṅkhya philosophy, how one after another, the form, taste, smell, touch are appreciated in different objects differently. Just like some eatable things---the form is appreciated by taste. The flower---the form is estimated by its smelling, aroma. So that is being explained.

[aside:] You can read the purport.

**Nitāi:**
"Every form that we appreciate has its particular dimensions and characteristics. The quality of a particular object is appreciated by its utility. But the form of sound is independent. Forms which are invisible can be understood only by touch; that is the independent appreciation of invisible form."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like the air. We cannot see, but we can touch. The air passes. It touches our body. We can understand, "Now the air is passing." Then?

**Nitāi:**
"Visible forms are understood by analytical study of their constitution. The constitution of a certain object is appreciated by its internal action. For example, the form of salt is appreciated by the interaction of salty tastes, and the form of sugar is appreciated by the interaction of sweet tastes. Tastes and the qualitative constitution are the basic principles in understanding the form of an object."

**Prabhupāda:**
So actually, everything has got form, and there is---why not?---the form of God also. He has got //virāḍ-rūpa,// and He has got small, also, //rūpa.// We have got experience of the //virāḍ-rūpa// in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// But that is not permanent //rūpa.// Permanent //rūpa// of Kṛṣṇa: //dvi-bhuja-muralīdhara.// He has got two hands and playing on flute. That is permanent //rūpa. Virāḍ-rūpa,// as it was shown to Arjuna, it is called //naimittika,// "under certain conditions." That is not eternal //rūpa. Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta... Anādi,// eternal.

The eternal //rūpa// is described in the //śāstra,//

> veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ
> barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam
> kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.30]

The eternal form is //veṇuṁ kvaṇantam:// Kṛṣṇa is always playing on His flute. That is eternal form. His eternal pastimes and eternal form is in Vṛndāvana. He does not go anywhere personally, leaving Vṛndāvana. //Padam ekaṁ na gacchati.// He is always in Vṛndāvana, but at the same time He is everywhere. //Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]: "Although He is always in His abode, Goloka Vṛndāvana, still He is present everywhere." How He is present? //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi// [Bs. 5.35]. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]: "He is situated in everyone's heart." He is situated in each and every universe. The universe is created by His breathing.

> yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya
> jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ
> viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣo
> [Bs. 5.48]

So the eternal form is Kṛṣṇa, but Viṣṇu, Mahā-Viṣṇu, who is the origin of material creation, //kalā-viśeṣa,// He is the expansion of the plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa: Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha, Pradyumna. In this way He is present everywhere. //Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān.// He is bigger than the biggest and the smaller than the smallest. Relativity. Now here we are small stature. So Kṛṣṇa is present in a stature so that we can touch Him, we can dress Him, we can decorate Him. Similarly, in other planets... It is relative. The law of relativity is going on everywhere. //Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān.//

So we have several times explained, //bhakti// means to engage all our senses in the service of the Lord. Our sense of seeing, eyes, nose, ears, tongue, hands, legs---everything should be engaged for Kṛṣṇa's service. All different parts of the body can be engaged. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. Kṛṣṇa can be served by all our senses according to the direction of the //śāstra// and //guru//---//sādhu, śāstra, guru.// Just like Ambarīṣa Mahārāja. He is devotee. We have to follow. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. The senses... The mind is the chief of the senses, and immediately under the mind, ten senses are working, ten: five knowledge-gathering senses, //jñānendriya,// and five working senses, //karmendriya.// And they have got different types of activities---hands, legs, tongue, ear, eyes. And above these, there is //ahaṅkāra,// false ego in the material world. The eleven senses, and the twelfth is the false ego. The false ego means I am thinking, "I am this body. I am body." Then expansion of body: "I belong to this family"; "I am the husband of this body"; "I am the father of this body"; "I am the brother of this body." Or "I belong to this nation"; "I belong to this species." This is called twelfth conception. It is different consciousness according to different body. And then "It is mine." With all these eleven senses, I form an idea of "I" and then my possession, "mine." //Ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. //Janasya moho 'yam.// This is called illusion, //māyā.//

So mind. It is expansion of the mind, different way. //Mānasa-vṛtti.// This is called the characteristic of the mind. Then subtle action of mind: thinking, feeling, willing. And the mind is expanding in hundreds, thousands, millions of ideas. In this way I am becoming entangled. So when this mind is controlled... The //yoga// system is for that purpose. Those who are too much bodily concept of life, bodily consciousness, they should practice this //yoga//---//haṭha-yoga, aṣṭāṅga-yoga//---so that the mind can be purified. As soon as the mind is purified, then all this expansion into thousands and millions of ideas will be controlled, and the only idea will be Kṛṣṇa. This is called //yoga// system, concentrating. //Dhyānāvasthita yogena paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ. Dhyānāvasthita-manasā:// "The mind is controlled, and the focus of the mind is on Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu." //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. Then we can see the effulgence, and the localized, and then the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

So any system of //yoga,// either //haṭha-yoga, jñāna-yoga,// or... //Karma-yoga// is in the lowest standard. And above all, //bhakti-yoga.// Then, when you come to the //bhakti-yoga,// that is the perfection of life. //Bhakti-yogena manasa samyak praṇihite amale// [[books:sb:1:7:4|[SB 1.7.4]]]. //Bhakti-yogena amala:// "The mind becomes cleansed." //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. That is the effect of..., direct effect of //bhakti-yoga.// Because the mind is now contaminated, and under the creation of senses and sense activities, we are making millions and trillions of ideas and become entangled in that idea. We have to accept millions and trillions of body and then go on in the cycle of birth, death, old age and disease. This is implication. So purify the mind. That is the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra. Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.// When our mind is cleansed... This is //mahā-dāvāgni.// This expansion of mental ideas, thousands and millions, that is //mahā..., bhava-mahā-dāvāgni. Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni.// So it is the duty of //guru// to get out his disciple from the //bhava-mahā-dāvāgni. Saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam. Kāruṇya, kāruṇya.//

So what is the //guru? Guru// has received the //kāruṇya. Kāruṇya// means just like the cloud has received water from the sea, similarly, a //guru,// spiritual master, receives the cloud of mercy from the ocean of kindness of Kṛṣṇa. //Ghanāghanatvam.// And it is only the cloud that can extinguish the forest fire, //saṁsāra.// No other watering system will be helpful. If there is fire in the forest, your fire brigade or buckets of water will not help. It is impossible. Neither you can go there; neither you can render any service by your fire brigade and bucket. Then how the fire can be extinguished? //Ghanāghanatvam.// If there is cloud in the sky and if there is rainfall, then the expansive forest fire can immediately be extinguished. So that cloud is supposed to be the spiritual master. He pours water. He pours water. //Śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye secana// [[books:cc:madhya:19:152|[Cc. Madhya 19.152]]]. What is that water? The water is this //śravaṇa-kīrtana. Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni,// the fire, the forest fire of material existence, is blazing continually. So you have to extinguish it by the rainfall from cloud, and that rainfall means //śravaṇa-kīrtana. Śravaṇa// means hearing, and //kīrtana// means chanting. This is the only way. //Śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye secana.//

In this way Caitanya Mahāprabhu has advised that //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. In this age, Kali-yuga, it is very difficult to perform the //yoga// system. This is also //yoga, bhakti-yoga.// Other //yoga// system is very difficult to execute. It is not possible. Even if it is possible---it may be possible for one or two persons---but //bhakti-yoga// is so nice that even a small child can practice it. We see practically the small children, they also taking part in it, without any education, without any culture, without any knowledge, automatically chanting, dancing, taking //caraṇāmṛta,// offering respect to the Vaiṣṇava. Automatically it is becoming. And that makes his life successful. //Bhakti-yoga// is so nice. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]]. Even little bit practiced, it will never go in vain. It will be an asset. //Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ// [[books:sb:10:12:7-11|[SB 10.12.11]]]. In this way... Just like if you put a one single paisa in the bank deposit, that is your money. It will be never lost. And when it becomes a lump sum, the bank asks you to... Credit you get, one hundred rupees or similar. Similarly, //bhakti-yoga// is so nice that whatever you acquire, intentionally or unintentionally, even if you neglectfully chant Hare Kṛṣṇa by imitating others, by joking others, it will have effect.

There is a verse in //Nṛsiṁha-Purāṇa// that one Muhammadan died calling //hārāma.// They say //hārāma.// Anything against their religion is called //hārāma.// So he was trapped by a boar, and the boars, the pigs, they... The Muhammadans, they call it //hārāma.// So when he was attacked, he said //hārāma.// So //hārāma.// But it was taken as "//Hā Rāma,//" "O Rāma," and he was liberated. So it is so nice. Some way or other, practice "//Hā Kṛṣṇa, Hā Rāma.//" Then your life is successful.

Thank you very much.
