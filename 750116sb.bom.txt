"By the interaction of fire and the visual sensation, the subtle element taste evolves under a superior arrangement. From taste, water is produced, and the tongue, which perceives taste, is also manifested."

**Prabhupāda:**

> rūpa-mātrād vikurvāṇāt
> tejaso daiva-coditāt
> rasa-mātram abhūt tasmād
> ambho jihvā rasa-grahaḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:41|[SB 3.26.41]]]

How water is manufactured, that is explained here. The modern scientists, they speak of manufacturing water by combination of two gases: hydrogen, oxygen. May be true to certain extent. But from Vedic literature we understand that by the interaction of form and touch through the agency of fire maybe there is perspiration. Just like when our body becomes too much heated, there is perspiration, the water comes out; similarly, the same process we get the water, //ambho.// And as soon as there is water there is //jihvā,// the sense of touch, //rasa-graha,// which can taste. //Jihvā// is meant for tasting. So this is the way of physical manifestation of different ways. But on the background there is //daiva-codita.// Everything is coming into existence on account of superior management, or superior impelling. That is the main proposition, that //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. These things we..., physical transformation, different ways, we experience. That is the phenomenal world. But these things are taking place not automatically but //daiva-coditāt,// by superior intervention, impelled by the superior Personality of Godhead.

So as we explained last night, every action and reaction is being completed by the superior person, Kṛṣṇa. But He has got so multi-energies that He does not require... Just like we have to see so many things personally. Just like in this management of our institution, sometimes we have to take personal care: "How this is being managed." Because we have to see there may not be any discrepancies in the service of the Lord. That is our duty. But entirely if we depend on Kṛṣṇa, things will go on. But we have to depend in that way. He has got such fine machinery. The first thing is that He is seated in everyone's heart. //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. So He can give instruction to perform the respective duties---but provided there is another thing: personal consideration. The chance is given to the personal living being to take this chance but not misuse your little independence. Chance is given everyone. And Kṛṣṇa's another business is: He does not interfere with the little independence given to the living being. So he must voluntarily surrender his little independence. Does not..., Kṛṣṇa does not force; Kṛṣṇa desires, He orders, that "You do this." //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. But He does not interfere with the little independence. That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy, how He can do that. Kṛṣṇa is not like us, that I give you something and again I ask you to return it. No. Whatever Kṛṣṇa has given to us, that is permanent.

So He has given us little independence because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is fully independent. He does not depend on anyone. But although we have got independence to a certain extent, but under the control of //māyā.// In the spiritual life there is also //māyā.// That is called //yoga-māyā.// And in the material life there is also //māyā.// That is called //mahā-māyā,// Durgā. So we, being very little... Just like small children: he is given either to the mother for taking care or to the nurse for taking care. The little child must be taken care of, either by the mother or an appointed nurse, maidservant. Similarly, we being very teeny, small, fragmental, atomic part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, although we have got all the ingredients of Kṛṣṇa, still, we require protection. Just like the child and the father. The child possesses all the chemical composition of the father's body. Even if the father is diseased, the child inherits the disease also. This is a fact. Similarly, we have got all the ingredients or qualities of God in us, but in many..., in very, very small fragmental portions. Therefore, although we have got Kṛṣṇa's qualities, still we sometimes fall down. Because it is very, very minute, fragmental, there is chance of being covered by something else.

So we require protection. Therefore, //mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. The //mahātmā,// they are also given protection by //daivī-prakṛti,// Kṛṣṇa's //māyā.// Therefore we chant "Hare Kṛṣṇa," not alone "Kṛṣṇa." Harā is Kṛṣṇa's energy, so we first of all take the shelter of Kṛṣṇa's energy, //daivī-māyā,// Rādhārāṇī. In Vṛndāvana they chant "Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa," "//Jaya// Rādhe." The general addressing is "Rādhe," like that. So to take shelter of the //daivī-māyā... Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. If we take shelter of the //daivī-māyā,// Rādhārāṇī, then She will give us intelligence in such a way that we can take shelter of Kṛṣṇa perfectly. So //daivī-māyā āśritāḥ,// as soon as we become under the shelter of //daivī-māyā,// then our business becomes //bhajanty ananya-manasaḥ:// simply serving Kṛṣṇa, no other business. And in the material world, so long we are under the protection of //mahā-māyā,// we have got many things to serve. //Bahu-śākhā hy anantāś ca buddhayo 'vyavasāyinām// [[books:bg:2:41|[Bg. 2.41]]]. When we are under the care of //daivī-māyā,// then our only business is to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is our original constitutional position, //kṛṣṇa-dāsa.// As we have several times given this example, the part and parcel of my body, the finger, it is always serving the whole body according to the order; similarly, as part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa, our only business is to serve Him. Whatever we have got in possession...

Now it is explained by Kapiladeva how things are developing, everything. This evening we were discussing. Here it is said that //jihvā ambho.// They are coming out by interaction of touch sensation, the fire. In this way everything is emanating. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. The original source is Kṛṣṇa. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. This is the real science. Everything is coming from Him. So whatever we possess, the physical transformation, the gross body and the subtle mind, intelligence, everything is produced from the original source, Kṛṣṇa. So same thing, when it is utilized by clear understanding that "Everything is emanation from Kṛṣṇa. Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. So let us utilize it for Kṛṣṇa's service," then we are situated in the //daivī-māyā. Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. This is //daivī-prakṛti.// And the result is //bhajanty ananya-manasaḥ.// Without any deviation they are engaged, the devotees are engaged, in Kṛṣṇa's service. That is the perfection of life. And in this life, so long we are in material condition, we are practicing how to be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service twenty-four hours. And when it is perfection... //Tataḥ, tattvato jñātvā.//

Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. If you want to understand Kṛṣṇa or if anyone wants to understand Kṛṣṇa perfectly, //tattvataḥ,// in truth, then he has to understand it through //bhakti,// not any other process, although there are many other processes, different ways. Some so-called philosophers, they say that "We can adopt any process. It leads to the same goal." That's all right, provided you make progress. Then you'll reach to the same goal. But if you become stuck up with the process only, you do not make progress, then it does not lead to the same goal. Just like one staircase going to the fourth floor. So you cross, say, twenty-five steps. You are in a certain position. If you cross fifty steps, you are in a certain position. If you cross sixty steps... In this way, the final may be hundred steps. So unless you go to the hundredth step, the final position is not attained, although it is leading to the same goal. Therefore we have to make progress. From //karma-kāṇḍa// we have to learn what is the actual position of //karma-kāṇḍa,// why you are engaged in //karma-kāṇḍa.// That is called //jñāna.// Then, coming to the //jñāna-kāṇḍa,// then you come to the //upāsanā-kāṇḍa.// Then //upāsanā-kāṇḍa,// when you reach the highest, topmost //upāsanā... Upāsanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param.// When you become Vaiṣṇava, when you worship Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, that is the perfectional stage.

So //mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. Everyone is going to the same goal, but he has to make further progress. Don't think, "By //karma-kāṇḍa// we have come to the final stage," or "By //jñāna-kāṇḍa,// we can..., we have come to the final stage," or "By //upāsanā-kāṇḍa,// by worshiping demigods, we have come to the final stage." No. The final stage, you can come directly by //bhakti,// the topmost //upāsanā.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa says directly, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. So //bhakti// process is //śravaṇam// beginning. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. So we have to hear these subject matters described in //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Then we will understand how Kṛṣṇa is conducting this phenomenal world. That you have to learn by hearing. Why this //Bhāgavatam// is there? For... //Yad vaiṣṇavānāṁ priyaḥ.// The Vaiṣṇava will enjoy, will learn from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// how Kṛṣṇa is working in everything. That will enlighten the devotee that how Kṛṣṇa is great, by His different energies how He is working in every field of activities.

//Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.7]. He is present here, Kṛṣṇa. He has nothing to do. //Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate.// Everything is ready. Either automatically or in order to accept service from the devotee, He is assuming that "I am dependent on you. If you dress Me, then I can be dressed." But actually that is not the fact. He is dressing Himself by giving you intelligence. //Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ yena mām upayānti te// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. Those who are desire..., desirous to serve Him, then Kṛṣṇa gives him intelligence how to serve Him. He does not depend on your service. He's quite self-sufficient. But He assumes that "I am a statue of stone. I cannot dress Myself. Please dress Me." This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy, to give you chance. He does not depend on you. //Na tasya kār...// There are many energies. Kṛṣṇa is worshiped by many, many goddess of fortune. //Lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānam// [Bs. 5.29]. So He doesn't require our service. But He agrees. He is so kind that He agrees to come here to accept our service. Therefore we must be very careful, that "Kṛṣṇa has kindly consented to come here to accept our service. Now we may not do something which is not satisfactory to Him." That is devotion. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness---always all full veneration. Don't think that "Here is a statue." Here is Kṛṣṇa.

So Kṛṣṇa is ready to accept our service in so many ways. Either if you cannot establish Deity, then you simply hear about Him. That is the most important thing. We do not require to establish temple everywhere. If there is possible to establish temple and serve Kṛṣṇa properly according to the regulation mentioned in the //śāstras// or instructed by the spiritual master... That is called //vaidhī-bhakti. Vaidhī-bhakti. Vaidhī-bhakti// means discharging devotional service under regulative principles. So without //vaidhī-bhakti// you cannot jump to the //rāga-bhakti. Rāga-bhakti// is spontaneous. That does not require any regulative principles. Out of love, out of feeling, anyone wants to serve Kṛṣṇa, that is called.... That is //gopīs.// All the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they did not undergo any regulative principles. But spontaneously, they are always ready to serve God, Kṛṣṇa. That is called //rāga-bhakti.//

Just like to... The example... There are examples. Just like a mother, as soon as there is child, baby, she takes care. She takes care. Although she does not go to a school how to take care of a child, but automatically, automatically she takes care. Similarly, this automatically serving Kṛṣṇa, that is called //rāga-bhakti.// That is reached by //viddhi-bhakti,// by practicing. Just like formerly there was marriage, child marriage---a small boy, a small girl. But simply by association the girl understands how to serve the husband and the husband also understand how to give protection to the wife, and mostly, the life was very pleasing, happy. From the very beginning she knows, "Here is my husband," and he knows, "Here is my wife." At least we have seen in our India. There is no question of separation. There is no question of divorce. The love is there from the very beginning. The propensity was there, and immediately the object of love is there. A girl has got husband; a husband has got a wife. So the love continues spontaneously.

So from the very beginning of our life we should try to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness, love Kṛṣṇa. Then automatically it becomes manifest. That is the instruction of Prahlāda Mahārāja: //kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. //Kaumāra. Kaumāra// means up to tenth year, five to tenth year; according to somebody, even up to fifteenth year. Anyway, during this period of life one should learn how to develop this devotional cult, //dharmān bhāgavatān. Dharma// means the laws and the instruction given by God. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. And when that is actually executed directly between..., transaction between God and the devotee, that is real //dharma. Dharmān bhāgavatān.// They have different types of //dharmas,// but real //dharma// is //bhāgavata-dharma,// what we learn from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// to deal with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān. That is called //bhāgavatān.// So children should be instructed from the very beginning of their life this //bhāgavatān-dharma.// We are attempting to do that in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We have got an institution, //gurukula,// at Dallas, Texas, and they are learning very nicely. Just like this child: from the very beginning he is learning //bhāgavatān-dharma.// He is offering obeisances, he is chanting, he is dancing, he is offering a flower to the spiritual master, and he is offering to the Vaiṣṇavas. In his childish way, while playing, he is becoming accustomed to //dharmān bhāgavatān.// This is real, really human civilization, from the very beginning of life. Because if we want, we can learn like cats and dog, jumping and eating and sleeping and mating. No. That is not the business of the human life.

Prahlāda Mahārāja therefore says, //kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. "Why? Why //bhāgavata-dharma// so important that I have to learn from the beginning of my life?" Now, //durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma tad apy adhruvam arthadam:// "This human life is very rarely obtained," //durlabham. Dur// means "very difficult." After many, many births, //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]], this human form, after evolution, we have got. //Durlabham,// with great difficulty we have got it. That, why it is important? Now, it is //arthadam. Arthadam. Artha// means meaningful or riches or something wealth. //Arthadam,// you can achieve //arthadam.// So that //arthadam,// although //adhruvam...// You can say, "What is the difference between human life and dog's life? They are all temporary. Why you are giving so much stress on human life, the same business: eating, sleeping, sex life and defense? So why you are giving more importance to the human life?" Now, //arthadam. Yad apy adhruvam,// nonpermanent, it is //arthadam. Arthadam// means to achieve the goal of your life. So we should not misuse it. We should teach our children to become //bhāgavatam,// person //bhāgavatam,// by reading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

So we are teaching from the very beginning //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and they are learning. That is the way. If you simply learn //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// you get so much knowledge how things are developing, how tongue is developing, how the taste is developing, how touch is developing, how fire is working, how heat is working; from the interaction of heat and touch, how things are devel... Everything is explained there. Physical and spiritual, everything is there. So this is //bhāgavata-dharma,// to study //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// very carefully. Everything is... Every knowledge is there. //Kiṁ vā parair īśvaraḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. There is no need of reading any other book. //Kiṁ vā paraiḥ,// in the beginning it is said. Why? //Sadyo hṛdy avarudhyate īśvaraḥ.// The perfection of life is to understand God. So by reading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sadyaḥ,// immediately, //hṛdy avarudhyate īśvaraḥ:// "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, by simply reading //Bhāgavatam...// He is already there, but immediately He is realized." That is perfection of life.

So //Bhāgavata// is so powerful that //nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā:// we have to read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// daily, and twenty-four hours. That is the injunction: //nityam. Nityam// means "always." So our members especially, I mean to say, those who are inmates, they, and those who are becoming members, ordinary member or patron member, we are giving them books. Please read them carefully. Don't take books that "I am member. It is my duty to take books and keep it in the //almirah.//" No. Read it thoroughly. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.// By regular reading of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// then our this material contamination becomes vanquished. //Naṣṭa-prāyeṣu. Naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. As soon as it begins to diminish, then it will diminish finally, and then you will be situated in your pure, original constitutional position, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //bhakti-yogataḥ. Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]. By cleansing the heart we become //prasanna-manasaḥ,// very jubilant. //Bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ.// Therefore this //bhāgavata-dharma// should be practiced from the very beginning of life, and it should be studied. We have got so many books. One can read... Whatever already we have got, books, one can read for fifty years continually and get new enlightenment one after another.

So //bhāgavata// means the complete knowledge. //Bhāgavata,// from //bhagavān// it is called //bhāgavata.// From //bhagavat-śabda// it is called //bhāgavata.// So in the association of //bhāgavata,// devotees, if we read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam... Sajātīya snigdhasya. Sajātīya:// when people thinking in the same way. So that means devotees who are interested in //bhagavad-bhakti,// to understand Bhagavān, they should read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the association. We should have regular classes, just like school and colleges, eight hour, six hour. Be engaged always in reading //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// discussing amongst yourself. Then you'll make progress. Otherwise, if you take it as an official routine work... You should take as routine work, but with consciousness that "We have to learn something," not simply attending the class, but to learn something. In this way make your life successful. Because after all, everything is being done //daiva-coditāt,// impelled by the Supreme Person. The Supreme Person is behind everything. So in the association of devotees, if we read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// regularly, then your..., our material contamination will be dissolved, and our spiritual consciousness will come out, and that will make our life successful.

Thank you very much.
