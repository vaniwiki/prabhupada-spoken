"Due to the interaction of water with the taste perception, the subtle element odor evolves under superior arrangement. Thence the earth and the olfactory sense, by which we can variously experience the aroma of the earth, become manifest."

**Prabhupāda:**

> rasa-mātrād vikurvāṇād
> ambhaso daiva-coditāt
> gandha-mātram abhūt tasmāt
> pṛthvī ghrāṇas tu gandhagaḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:44|[SB 3.26.44]]]

So further analytical study of water is mentioned here by Kapiladeva. So the //rasa,// taste. Taste changes into //gandha,// smell. So the taste is created by //daiva-coditāt.// Taste of everything... Everything is being done, //daiva-coditāt,// the beginning. But the taste creates the different kinds of fragrance, //gandha,// smell, within the earth. There is water, there is taste, and taste and formation---either you say chemical or physical changes---it becomes smell. So different kinds of smell there are already within the earth. Simply it brings out by different methods. The scientist does not know. That we have already explained several times, that the different //gandha,// or smell, or fragrance, or aroma, whatever you call, there are already within the earth. //Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca// [[books:bg:7:9|[Bg. 7.9]]]. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, puṇyo gandhaḥ// and //pāpo gandhaḥ.// In the material world, everywhere there are two things: pious and impious. So the //pāpo gandhaḥ,// bad smell, when it passes, so you close your nose, nostrils, not to accept it. But when there is //puṇyo gandhaḥ,// you feel fresh: "Oh, it is very nice."

So Kṛṣṇa says, //puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.// When you smell something very fragrant... Just like in the flower. There are different varieties of flower, and they are exacting different varieties of aroma from the earth. So the good smell of the flower... In some other place it is said in the //Bhāgavatam// that the..., when you see flower, you see Kṛṣṇa smiling. That is the seeing of Kṛṣṇa smiling. Therefore the flower should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa's service. Because these flowers, everything, is Kṛṣṇa's energy. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. So specifically good fragrance of flower, Kṛṣṇa says that "I am that." Kṛṣṇa's particular presence is there. So we can remember Kṛṣṇa immediately. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that you remember always Kṛṣṇa. Always Kṛṣṇa.

Just like Mahārāja Ambarīṣa did. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. He engaged his mind at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa---simply by engaging the mind. //Vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.// If we utilize our senses always in the service of the Lord, that is //bhakti.// At the present moment we are utilizing our senses for material objectives. That is to be purified. It should be used for Kṛṣṇa's service. We are using our senses for the service of society, friendship and love. But that service should be transferred to Kṛṣṇa. Then it is //bhakti. Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Bhakti// means... This flower, we are smelling; we are enjoying. That is sense gratification. Similarly, this same flower, if it is offered to Kṛṣṇa as garland, that He will smell it and feel pleasure, that is //bhakti.//

So to come to the //bhakti-mārga,// or devotional service, it is not very difficult. The smell is creation of God, or Kṛṣṇa, //puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.// Therefore the smell should be used for Kṛṣṇa's pleasure---this is //bhakti//---not for my pleasure. This is called //tyāga. Tyāga// means that actually it should be used for Kṛṣṇa, who has produced it. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. Our senses are also Kṛṣṇa's senses. He is Hṛṣīkeśa. //Hṛṣīka-īśa, iti hṛṣīkeśa. Hṛṣīka// means senses. Unfortunately, our senses are being used for sense satisfaction, neither for our use. It is for sense gratification. So //bhakti// means this practice of using the senses for sense gratification should be rectified, should be purified. Then the same senses will be utilized for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, and then you become a //bhakta.// Kṛṣṇa's things may be used for Kṛṣṇa. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]].

The //Caitanya-caritāmṛta kaṛacā,// the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// he has distinguished between //kāma// and //prema. Kāma// means lusty desires or sex desires. Generally it is meant, sex desires. So he has very simplified the matter very much. //Ātmendriya-prīti-vāñchā---dhare..., nāma dhare..., prema..., tāre..., bali dhare..., nāma kāma// [[books:cc:adi:4:165|[Cc. Ādi 4.165]]], like that. //Kṛṣṇendriya-prīti-vāñchā dhare nāma prema,// and //ātmendriya-prīti-vāñchā---dhare nāma kāma.// They... Actually, senses are there for satisfaction. That's a fact. Otherwise, why the senses are there? Just like the smell is there, and the nose is there. So smell is there for satisfaction of the senses. For the smell, for the nose, nostril, the beautiful flower is there, or beautiful..., anything beautiful. To the man, woman is beautiful; to the woman, man is beautiful. So the eyes are there, and the beautiful things are there. That is arrangement. That is development of this nature. As soon as... It is... It is coming from the fire. The... That we have already described. The fire is the origin of beauty, and the fire is the origin of eyesight. The loss of eyesight means there is less fiery element. Loss of appetite means there is less of fiery elements. In the Āyurvedic treatment it is called //agni-māndyam.// So these are transformation of the fire. Similarly, the smell is transformation of the //rasa,// taste.

How subtle things are going on, that is described in the Sāṅkhya philosophy presented by Kapiladeva, but we do not understand practically how things are going on. We are simply accepting the words that "By transformation of this thing, this thing is coming out so much." Neither it is possible to make experiment. Maybe; but scientists can take advantage of this Sāṅkhya philosophy. So you may experiment or not. That doesn't matter. Things are going on. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā manyate...// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. What is called?

**Devotees:**
//Kartāham iti manyate.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kartāham iti manyate.// Actually, these rules of transformation as ordained by //daiva-coditāt,// by the supreme design, that is going on. But we, under the name of so-called scientist, we are trying to take the credit. Just like they are testing now---in the test tube they are making life. But the substance, the semina, male and female, that you cannot create. That you have to take from the male, from the female, then put together in the test tube. Then it may come. They are very much proud that "Now in the laboratory we are making life by chemical combination." But the actual chemical coming from by this transformation under the supervision of the //daiva, daiva-coditāt. Daiva// is the principal cause. //Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1]. That they do not accept. And people are giving credit to these artificial scientist.

In our Delhi program... There was lecture of a big scientist in Delhi; I forgot his name. He gave very good example that if a man learns how to bark like dog, and if he makes a show, many thousands of people will purchase ticket and go and see how he is barking. [laughter] But by nature's arrangement so many dogs are barking; nobody takes care. You see? So similarly, in the laboratory if a scientist can produce a life some way or other, so they will go and see and give him clap. Just like this aeroplane is flying in the air. Little discrepancy is immediately crash down. So he is getting so much credit, and the scientists also saying, "There is no need of God. Now we have solved all the questions." But nobody is giving credit to Kṛṣṇa, who is floating millions and trillions of stars and planets in the air. So by taking Kṛṣṇa's stock, the petroleum or gas, we become scientist and fly the aeroplane, and Kṛṣṇa has given the petrol, and He has no credit. He has no credit. That is the difference between demons and //bhakta.// A //bhakta// sees in everything presence of Kṛṣṇa: "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa's energy is there. Here is nice taste. Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa." //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]].

So Kṛṣṇa has manifested Himself in so many ways by His different energies. We have to learn simply to know or see how Kṛṣṇa is working. So here it is stated that //rasa-mātrād vikurvāṇād ambhaso daiva-coditāt.// Kṛṣṇa is working there. //Vikur...,// transformation does not take place automatically. Just like the other day I gave you the example: there is oil and there is soda, but you can transform into soap by mixing together. That mixing process does not take automatically. There is Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's part and parcel, the living entity. We are also Kṛṣṇa's part and parcel. So scientist is working, a devotee sees that Kṛṣṇa is working. That is the difference between nondevotee and devotee. A nondevotee will give credit to the scientist, who is working subordinately under the orders of Kṛṣṇa. That is stated also in the //Bhagavad-gītā: sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. In everyone's heart Kṛṣṇa is there. So one man is working very nicely. He is taking the credit of becoming a scientist. Why the other man cannot do it? Another man is also working in the laboratory.

Just like this airless telegram, radio. Many scientists were working, and in our childhood we have... I was present in a meeting. Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose was speaking. So Marconi and Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose and many other physists, they were working to study the waves of air and how to establish wireless telegram. So actually, Jagadish Chandra Bose, he found out the means, and they were talking, Marconi and Jagadish Chandra Bose. Marconi took the hint and immediately he published in the paper. And in those British ruling, British government, they wanted to give credit all to the Englishmen. Actually, this wireless telegram was established by Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose. He spoke in a meeting.

So anyway... Just like two scientists are working to find out something, to invent something, but the wireless telegram is in the credit of Mr. Marconi. Why not Jagadish Chandra Bose? There is the hand of Kṛṣṇa. They are so many people are working for inventing something, but one man takes the credit; other man cannot. Why? Why this discrimination? There must be some cause of this discrimination. That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā, sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ:// "I am situated in everyone's heart." //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. //Mattaḥ,// "From Me, if I give you the intelligence, 'Now mix this chemical with this chemical, your product will come.' " Others, they have got the chemical, and the laboratory man also there. But one takes the credit; one cannot take the credit. That is due to Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa gives the intelligence, then he gets the intelligence and he takes the credit.

//Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin.// Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna that "This plan of Battle of Kurukṣetra is already there. I have caused assembly of all the demonic persons here." And //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]: "This is My plan. So Arjuna, I am flattering you so much that you fight. Fight. But don't think if you do not fight, they will go home. They will have to die here, because it is My plan already." //Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin:// "Because you are My devotee, you take the credit. You take the credit." So actually a devotee, because he is very sincere servant of Kṛṣṇa, so Kṛṣṇa wants to give credit to His devotee, although He is doing everything. //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. So always think like that, that... Do not try to take credit yourself. We should always remember that it is Kṛṣṇa's credit. He wants to do something at a certain time, and some of his servant is authorized to do that. That's all. Otherwise, whole credit goes to Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Govindam ādi-puruṣam.//

Just like Brahmā. Brahmā has created this universe, but he knows that he is not the creator. When Nārada Muni inquired from Brahmā that "We know that we are creator..., you are the creator," Brahmā said, "My dear son, you are wrongly impressed. I am not creator. The creator is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." That is mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1]. And in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, //tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Brahmā was given inspiration or lesson from within the heart. Kṛṣṇa is therefore called //caitya-guru,// "the //guru// from the heart." So He gives intelligence for doing particular thing when He is satisfied with the service. //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. Kṛṣṇa is ready to give intelligence to everyone, because everyone is Kṛṣṇa's son. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. //Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. So father is not particularly inclined to a particular son. No. But a son, if he is very obedient, then father discloses the most confidential things to that son. This is natural. This is not partiality. That is also explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā, samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo 'sti na priyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:29|[Bg. 9.29]]]: "I am equal to..." Otherwise, how He can be God? If He is partial to somebody... Foolish people think, "Why God has made me poor? Why God has made so many poor men?" God has not made. They have made themselves poor. God has not made. He does not make any distinguish. He says the plain truth, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. He is saying to everyone. So if we do not do---we have got little independence---then we are in this miserable condition of life.

So these miseries of the society, that is not creation by God. God is very, very kind to everyone. //Samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo 'sti na priyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:29|[Bg. 9.29]]]. Nobody is Kṛṣṇa's, or God's, enemy; nobody is Kṛṣṇa's friend. But one who wants to serve Kṛṣṇa as friend, His consideration is different: "Oh, here is a willing servant." That is //bhakti. Bhakti// means willingness. //Śānta, dāsya, sākhya, vātsalya, mādhurya//---these are the different development of //bhakti.// First of all, in the material stage, we are defying, "Oh, what is..." That is asuric. "What is God? We are doing everything." A big //svāmī// lectured in America, and he was advocating, "Why you are giving credit to God? You are laboring, you are working, you are getting the result. Why should you give credit to God?" This was the subject matter. That is demonic. All credit should go to God. That is //bhakti.//

Actually, without Kṛṣṇa's help, without God's help, you cannot do anything. //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi... Kartāham iti manyate// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. In the demonic stage the living entity becomes a, what is called, play dog. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. Just like you have been in the beach: the dog is bound up by the chain, or the master says, "You come here," he has to come here. "You go there," like that. So we are enchained by these laws of material nature---//daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]---but we are claiming independent. There is no independence. There cannot be independence. You are the servant. We are all the servant of //māyā, prakṛti,// because we have given up the service of the Lord. Our constitutional position is to remain a servant. But if we defy God, Kṛṣṇa, and we want to become independent, that means we become servant of //prakṛti. Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. We associate with different modes of material nature---//sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// And under different association or being controlled by different modes of material nature, we are getting different varieties of body.

Why one has got very good body, very //brāhmaṇa// body or rich man's body, and why one has got dog's body, cat's body, tree's body? Why? There is some arrangement. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa.// This is the injunction, that you are working under the impulse of certain modes of material nature. That is being observed by the Supersoul, //anumantā upadraṣṭā// [[books:bg:13:23|[Bg. 13.23]]]. He is seeing all your activities. So you wanted something to do, but you require certain body to do that. That is being arranged by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur dehopapattaye// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. This is the law. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. Why one living entity is getting a better type of body, another a very low, abominable type of body? //Daiva-netreṇa.//

Therefore this consciousness can be awakened in this human form of life. We can take education. We can understand from Vedic knowledge what is our position, what is our relationship with God, how we shall act in that relationship. These are the opportunities in this human form of life---not in the form of cats and dogs. So in spite of getting this opportunity, if we do not understand God, if we do not understand what is our relationship with God, then according to //śāstra// it is called //ātma-hā. Ātma-hā// means suicide. If you cut your throat yourself, who can save you? So we should not become //ātma-hā// and spoil this life. //Durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma tad apy adhruvam arthadam// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]] This human form life, //durlabham.// After many, many millions of evolution, we have got it. So it is very //durlabha. Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati// [Padma Purāṇa]. So we have got this opportunity by the grace of God, or the material nature has given us this opportunity. Now we should utilize it properly. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Don't spoil it.

And what is that? //Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. From the very childhood this //dharmān bhāgavatān// must be given lessons to the children. Therefore, from the very beginning we have opened this //gurukula// in Texas and in New Vrindaban, West Virginia. But here, practically, India, we don't get this opportunity. Before starting this movement, I approached many friends that "You have got four sons. Give me one. I will train him to become a Vaiṣṇava //brāhmaṇa.//" Nobody agreed. You see? But in the European countries, in America... Of course, they are all children of my devotees. I got them married. They have got now children, and they are being taught in //gurukula.// That is strictly according to the Vedic science, //kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha,// from the very beginning of life. So life should be utilized properly, and the children... Not all. Some of them may become //kṣatriya;// some of them become //śūdra// or //vaiśya.// But an ideal class of //brāhmaṇa// must be there to guide the society. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
