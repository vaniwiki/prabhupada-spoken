Hmm? You bring. You can bring one chair here.

Just like we were talking of industries. The industries, they are mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā// as //ugra-karma. Ugra-karma// means ferocious activities. For livelihood, we require our maintenance. //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-mai...// These are the primary necessities of this body, material body. For that, Kṛṣṇa has said, //annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. //Anna//---mean food grains---we require. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni.// That food grains we can produce very easily by agriculture. In another place Kṛṣṇa says, //kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. We can produce sufficient food grains for our maintenance, and the whole world has got sufficient land.

I have traveled over the world at least fourteen times. During the last eight years I have traveled all over the world, even interior. I have seen there is enough land, especially in Africa, in Australia, in America, and we can produce so much food grains that ten times of this present population can be easily maintained. Ten times. There is no scarcity of food. But the difficulty is that we have demarcated, "This is my land." Somebody says, "This is American, my land," "Australia, my land," "The Africa, my land," "India, my land." This "my" and "I." //Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This is called illusion, that "I" and "my." "I am this body, and this is my property." This is called illusion. And this illusion, if we stand on this platform of illusion, then we are no better than the animals.

> yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke
> sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> janeṣu abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

//Go// means cow, and //kharaḥ// means ass. Those who are in the bodily concept of life, //ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]], they are no better than these asses and the cows, means the animals. This is going on.

I'll not take much of your time, but I shall try to convince you what is the purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. The purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to save the human society from becoming animals---cows and asses. This is the movement. They have established their civilization, as it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// animal or asuric civilization. Asuric civilization, beginning is //pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca janā na vidur āsurāḥ// [[books:bg:16:7|[Bg. 16.7]]]. The asuric, demonic, civilization, they do not know in which way we have to guide ourself for attaining the perfection of life, //pravṛtti,// and //nivṛtti,// and which we shall not take---favorable and unfavorable. Human life... Everyone knows, "This is favorable for me, and this is unfavorable for me." So //āsurāḥ janā,// those who are demonic persons, they do not know this, that "What is favorable for me and what is not favorable for me." //Pravṛttiṁ nivṛttiṁ ca janā na vidur āsurāḥ, na śaucaṁ nāpi cācāraḥ:// "There is no cleanliness, nor good behavior," //na satyaṁ teṣu vidya...,// "and there is no truth in their life." This is asuric. We have heard many times, "//asuras,//" "asuric civilization," "demonic civilization." This is the beginning.

> pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca
> janā na vidur āsurāḥ
> na śaucaṁ nāpi cācāro
> na satyaṁ teṣu...
> [[books:bg:16:7|[Bg. 16.7]]]

//Satyam,// there is no truthfulness. And just the first-class life means the //brāhmaṇa// life. //Satyaṁ śaucaṁ tapo.// The beginning is //satyam.// The asuric life is no //satya,// no truth; and the first-class life in human society, the //brāhmaṇas,// is //satyaṁ śaucaṁ tapo// and //titikṣa ārjavaḥ āstikyaṁ jñānaṁ vijñānam.// This is first-class life.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to create a class of men ideal, first-class men, with //satyaṁ, śaucaṁ, tapo, śamaḥ, damaḥ, titikṣaḥ.// This is godly civilization. And this godly civilization can be given to the whole world by India. That is India's special privilege. Because in other countries beyond India they are almost //āsuri-janā// and //ugra-karma.// The industries and other //ugra-karma// has come from the Western countries. But by this way people will never be happy. That is very elaborately explained in the Sixteenth Chapter of the //Bhagavad-gītā. Duṣpūra akaṅkṣa.// Their desire will never be satisfied by this material advancement. They do not know. They are forgetting. So we selected this Bombay. Bombay city is the best city, most advanced city in India, the best city in India. And people are also very nice. They are religiously inclined. They are opulent. They can take up better things very nicely. Therefore I wanted to start this center, Bombay, for spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Although there have been many impediments in my endeavor, still, ultimately it is Kṛṣṇa's business. It will come successful. So today... The foundation and cornerstone establishment was done two years before, but there are many, many impediments from the asuric //janā.// Now, some way or other, we have got little relief from such impediments. So we are putting this cornerstone this auspicious day, and I am very glad that you have joined us.

So the mission is very, very authorized, and it comprehends a very large jurisdiction of activities. Therefore my request is that the inhabitants of Bombay, especially those who are our members, they will kindly take active part how to make this institution very successful in Bombay. So, many ladies and gentlemen are present here. We are, whatever we are doing, it is not whimsical or mental concoction. It is authorized and just to the standard of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Our present movement is based on //Bhagavad-gītā---Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. We don't interpret. We do not interpret foolishly, because... I say purposefully this word "foolishly," that why should we interpret Kṛṣṇa's words? Am I more than Kṛṣṇa? Or did Kṛṣṇa leave some portion to be explained by me by interpretation? Then where is the importance of Kṛṣṇa? If I give my own interpretation, thinking myself more than Kṛṣṇa, this is blasphemy. How I can become more than Kṛṣṇa?

If actually we want to take advantage of this //Bhagavad-gītā,// then we must take //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, just like Arjuna took. Arjuna, after hearing //Bhagavad-gītā,// he said, //sarvam etam ṛtaṁ manye:// "I accept all the words, my dear Keśava, whatever You have said. I accept them //in toto,// without any change." This is understanding of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Not that I take advantage of the //Bhagavad-gītā// and I interpret in my foolish way so that people will accept my philosophy. This is not //Bhagavad-gītā.// There is no question of interpretation in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Interpretation is allowed when you cannot understand. When the things are clearly understood... If I say, "This is microphone," everyone understands this is microphone. Where is the necessity of interpreting it? There is no necessity. This is foolishness, misleading. There cannot be any interpretation in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is... Everything is clear to the point. Just like Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa says... Kṛṣṇa does not say that "You all become //sannyāsī// and give up your occupational duty." No. Kṛṣṇa says, //sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiḥ labhate naraḥ// [[books:bg:18:46|[Bg. 18.46]]]. You remain in your business. You remain your occupation. There is no need of changing. But still, you can become Kṛṣṇa conscious and make your life successful. This is the message of //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā// is not going to make any topsy-turvy of the social order or spiritual order. No. It should be standardized according to the authority. And the best authority is Kṛṣṇa.

So make this center successful, you ladies and gentlemen of Bombay. We have got very nice place. We are building so that you can come here, stay, at least in weekend. If you stay, all those who are retired or elderly gentlemen, ladies, they can come here and stay. We will have sufficient place. But try to organize these principles of //Bhagavad-gītā// all over the world. That will be the gift of India. Caitanya Mahāprabhu desired that anyone who has taken birth in India as human being, not cats and dogs... Cats and dog cannot take any part for doing good to others. He said,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

"Anyone who has taken his birth as human being in India, Bhārata-bhūmi, first of all make your life successful." Because you have got the standard, how to make life successful. Here is //Bhagavad-gītā.// Try to understand it, make your life successful, and then broadcast this message all over the world. That is //paropakāra.// So actually, India and India's people, they are meant for //paropakāra.// We are not meant for exploiting others. That is not our mission. Actually that is being done. Everyone goes out of India. They go there to exploit. But it is for the first time that India is giving something to the outsiders, this spiritual knowledge. And the proof you can see. We are giving; we are not taking. We do not go to beg, "Give me wheat, give me money, give me this, give me that." No. We are giving something substantial, and they are feeling obliged. Otherwise, why these young men and girls, they are after this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement? They are feeling something, that they are getting something tangible. So it has got potency, very good potency. They are not feeling like Americans or Canadians or Australians. We are also not feeling as Indians. On the spiritual platform we are one:

> vidyā-vinaya-sampanne
> brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
> śuni caiva śva-pāke ca
> paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]

This is real learning. //Ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu.// Even the great politician, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, he says,

> mātṛvat para-dāreṣu
> para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat
> ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu
> yaḥ paśyati sa paṇḍitaḥ
> [Nīti Śāstra]

So this is a great culture, //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. So those responsible ladies and gentlemen are present here, make this center very successful and come here, study //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is without any foolish interpretation. I say "foolish" again and again because interpretation is not at all required. Everything is clear, from the very beginning.

> dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre
> samavetā yuyutsavaḥ
> māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva
> kim akurvata sañjaya
> [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]

So very clear. Kurukṣetra is //dharma-kṣetra// still. In the //Vedas// it is stated, //kurukṣetre dharmam ācaret:// "One should go to Kurukṣetra and perform religious rituals." Therefore it is //dharma-kṣetra// from time immemorial. And why should we interpret it that "This Kurukṣetra means this body; //dharmakṣetra,// this body"? Why? Why mislead people? Stop this misleading. And Kurukṣetra is still there. Kurukṣetra station, railway station, is there. So try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, make your life successful, and spread this message all over the world. You will be happy; the world will be happy. Of course, I am now very old man. I am eighty years old. My life is finished. But I want some responsible Indian and combined with other countries... Other countries, they are giving good cooperation. Otherwise, it was not possible for me to spread in so short time, only seven or eight years, to preach this cult all over the world. So I require the cooperation of the Indian, especially young men, educated men. Come forward. Stay with us. Study //Bhagavad-gītā.// We haven't got anything to manufacture. Nothing to manufacture. And what we can manufacture? We are all imperfect. Whatever is there, let us study it and practically apply in life and spread the message all over the world. That is our mission.

So today is very auspicious day. With great difficulty we have got now sanction. Now please cooperate with this attempt as far as possible with your //prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā,// four things: by your life, by your words, by your money... //Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā śreya-ācaraṇaṁ sadā// [SB 10.22.35]. This is the mission of human life. Whatever you have got... It is not that "Because I am poor man, I cannot help this movement." No. If you have got... You have got your life. So if you dedicate your life, that is all-perfect. If you cannot dedicate your life, give some money. But if you can..., poor man, you cannot give money, then you give some intelligence. And if you are fool, then give your words. So any way, you can help this movement and do the welfare activities for India and outside India.

So that is my request. I welcome you. Of course, today is //ekādaśī.// We are, mostly we are fasting. Some //prasādam// will be given. So it is not the question of //prasādam;// it is the question of the important work we are taking in hand, how to spread a God consciousness movement. Otherwise, you will never be happy. Simply material consciousness, //gṛha-kṣetra... Ato gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This material civilization means the sex desire. Woman is hunting after man; man is hunting after woman. //Puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhavam etaṁ tayor mithaḥ.// And as soon as they are united, they require //gṛha,// apartment; //gṛha-kṣetra,// land; //gṛha-kṣetra-suta,// children, friends, money; and the //moho,// the illusion, //ahaṁ mameti,// "It is I. It is mine." This is material civilization. But the human life is not meant for that. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]].

So you study. We have got now enough book. There is no difficulty to study our books. We have given in English translation. Everyone, any gentleman, knows English. And we are going to give in Hindi, in Gujarati, in all other languages. Our friends, they have already begun translating. So there will be no scarcity of knowledge. Please come here, sit down at least once in a week, study all these books, try to understand the philosophy of life, and spread all over the world. That is the mission of //Bhārata-varṣa.//

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This is //paropakāra// movement, to do welfare to others, not like cats and dogs, simply bring money and sense enjoy. This is not human life. Human life is for //paropakāra.// People are in ignorance, without any knowledge of God, without the ideal of life. They are simply working like cats and dogs and hogs. So they should be educated. Human life is the chance for getting such education. So this is the center for educating the human society to become actually human being and make his life successful.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
