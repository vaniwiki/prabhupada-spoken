**Prabhupāda:**
...of Europe and of America. Everywhere, everywhere. You know who are //mūḍhās?//

**Tripurāri:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Tripurāri:**
Fools and rascals who won't take your books. Sometimes we convince them that this philosophy is very nice, and they agree, and we use Lord Kṛṣṇa's words, //dehino 'smin yathā dehe// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]], and they say "Yes, I can understand that, but I don't need your book," or "I would never read it." We say, "Well, no. Take it."

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] You ask them, "So you want to remain //mūḍhā?//"

**Tripurāri:**
We say, "No, take it home, and some day you will read it." They think they can find out on their own.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is foolishness. They cannot. //Mām eva ya prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]].

**Tripurāri:**
Sometimes they will agree to everything we say, but they will not give a donation. [Prabhupāda laughs] They trust more the man on the TV.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is lake?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Balavanta:**
In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// you say that the Rāhu planet is visible on the full moon night? The Rāhu planet?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, when there is eclipse.

**Balavanta:**
Oh, eclipse.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eclipse means Rāhu planet comes in front. [reading sign:] "No smoking"?

**Śrutakīrti:**
"No swimming."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Who is going to swim now? [laughter] [break]

**Tripurāri:**
Once Balavanta was very sick when he was dealing with the politicians, and I heard that you said it was because he..., by touching them and associating with them, he accepted some of their sinful reactions.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] I did not say. [laughter]

**Tripurāri:**
No?

**Prabhupāda:**
But it may be.

**Tripurāri:**
So I was wondering. Sometimes our men on //saṅkīrtana,// they are shaking hands...

**Prabhupāda:**
But you are //saṅkīrtana,// you cannot be infected. [break] ...party is infected, then preaching will stop. If doctor is infected, then treatment will stop. Doctor is never infected. They have good precautions. Similarly, when you are engaged in //saṅkīrtana, māyā// cannot touch. //Māyām etāṁ taranti te.// [break]

**Tripurāri:**
...disciples and you accept our //karma// also. Is that correct?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tripurāri:**
That is manifest sometimes in disease on your body?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tripurāri:**
So our men also are going out and preaching...

**Prabhupāda:**
Overloaded.

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
When we take your books on the library party to the professors at the universities, sometimes they think...

**Śrutakīrti:**
This way? Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Prabhupāda... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
I am surprised how I have written so many, what to speak of them? [laughter] It is all Kṛṣṇa's mercy.

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
One professor the other day was trying to convince one of our boys that you were coming in the disciplic succession and were authorized to translate all these books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is right.

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
Because he was dressed, and he didn't know that he was your disciple, so he was saying, "Bhaktivedanta Swami, he is coming in a disciplic line straight from Kṛṣṇa. That's why he can speak on all these books."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is a fact. That authority I have got. That's a fact.

> yasya deve parā bhaktir 
> yathā deve tathā gurau
> tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ
> prakaśānte 
> [ŚU 6.23]

They become manifest, all the meanings of the Vedic literature. //Yasya deve parā bhaktiḥ.// [aside:] Don't come very near. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

[break] ...explaining last evening: don't speculate; hear. That is the qualification. All others, they are simply speculating. How long their energy will go on, limited energy? How speculating will help them? It is not possible. It is condemned.

> athāpi te deva..., te deva padāmbuja-dvaya
> prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi
> jānāti tattvaṁ... 
> na cānyaeko 'pi ciraṁ vicinvan
> [SB 10.14.29]

//Ciraṁ vicinvan,// speculating for millions of years, one cannot understand. //Athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi:// "One who has received a little mercy of the lotus feet of the Lord, he can understand the truth. Others, even speculating for millions of years, they cannot understand anything." The speculation business is useless in spiritual advance. It may help Darwin to come to the conclusion that man is born from monkey. Because he is from monkey, he thinks others also from monkey. He has admitted that whatever he has given, it is simply a speculation. He has admitted. And all others also speculating. They are trying to manufacture life from chemicals, but they do not know that life is never manufactured; it is already there. Just like this grass is coming. The life is already there. In favorable circumstances it comes out. //Udbhija.// This is called //udbhija.// Similarly, fermentation. Just like the cockroaches come out... [break] [end]
