[Prabhupāda plays harmonium and sings "//Gāy gorā madhur sware//" for a few minutes]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just try.

**Haṁsadūta:**
I can't. No one can do like you do.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Gāy gorācand madhur sware.// [break] I think I have sung this song. Huh?

[break] [Prabhupāda continues playing and singing for a few more minutes]

Wherefrom you have purchased it?

**Haṁsadūta:**
This harmonium was originally made for Nara-nārāyaṇa, and then it was..., but it was never delivered to him. It was picked up by Maṇibaṇḍha. And Maṇibaṇḍha left it in Amsterdam, and so I... They did not like it, so I gave them a harmonium that I had, and I took this one. [Prabhupāda chuckles] Because I think it's very good, huh?

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not //very// good.

**Haṁsadūta:**
But it's nice. [laughs] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So //kīrtana// is going on, here and there.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Oh, yeah, everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
Paris also?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have seen that house?

**Brahmānanda:**
No, I didn't see it. I was only there just twenty-four hours.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think you change that silk cloth. Ordinary cloth is, because it does not stand, it becomes loose.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Plain cotton.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cotton is better.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that land, what is the description of the land here?

**Haṁsadūta:**
That I was telling you about?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Haṁsadūta:**
You know the lady in the front here. There's this lady, Miss... Um, I can't think of her name. She called us yesterday, and she said it is much bigger than the land which we have purchased here, which is four acres. We bought four acres. So she didn't say how big it was. She didn't tell us. But she said there's several houses on it. And it will cost approximately £38,000. So it seems to be quite a sizable piece of land. And the man who owns the property, he knows that we are interested in it, and he is willing to work with us. And so far as we are told, that nobody knows about it. It is confidential. [end]
