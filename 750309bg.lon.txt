"Now hear, O son of Pṛthā [Arjuna], how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt."

**Prabhupāda:**

> śrī bhagavān uvāca
> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

The Lord, Bhagavān... Bhagavān means the most powerful, almighty, with six opulences. That is Bhagavān. //Bhaga// means opulence, and //vān,// this word is used in the sense of "possession." Just like generally we say //bhāgyavān.// We Indians, we know. //Bhāgyavān// means fortunate. This word //bhāgya// comes from //bhaga. Bhaga,// and in relationship with //bhaga// the word comes //bhāgya.// And //vān// means "one who possesses." //Asty arthe vatup.// The Sanskrit word, when the meaning is to possess, then one affix is added which is called //vat, bhaga-vat.// And the first word of the //bhagavat-śabda// is //bhagavān.//

So we are trying to understand Bhagavān, which is explained by Bhagavān Himself---Bhagavān, God. You cannot understand God, or Bhagavān, by your speculation. Any one of us, our senses are defective. Just like we are very much proud of our eyes to see. Sometimes some rascal says, "Can you show me God?" He does not think that how far his eyes are capable to see, but he wants to see God. Our senses are conditional. So long the electric light is there, we can see. If it is immediately dark, we cannot see. Then what is the value of this seeing? But we are very much proud of seeing. Similarly, we have our defective senses, and we accept something which is not fact. That is called illusion. And we commit mistake, every one of us. There is no man in the world who can say, "I did not commit any mistake in my life." That is not possible. "To err is human," it is said. So we have got four defects: we commit mistake, we are illusioned, //bhrama-pramāda...// Just like we accept this body as myself: "I am this body." "Who are you?" "I am Mr. Such-and-such," "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am Englishman," "I am white," "I am black," "I am fat," "I am thin." In this way we give description of our body. But we do not know what I am. This is called illusion. And commit mistake, we have got experience. Many times we have committed mistake, blunder, in our life.

So //bhrama-pramāda-karaṇāpaṭava. Karaṇāpaṭava// means... //Karaṇa// means the senses through which we act. Just like we catch up through the hand. This is called //karaṇa.// So //karaṇa,// these are imperfect. I am catching with my hand, but if the hand is paralyzed... So long we are not paralyzed, our machine is going nicely, we can catch. Otherwise, we cannot catch. This is condition. We can catch under certain condition. So therefore our senses are imperfect. //Karaṇa apaṭu. Apaṭu// means imperfect. //Bhrama-pramāda-karaṇāpaṭava,// and another defect is //vañcana,// or cheating. I am so much defective; still, I want to impress others that I have got full knowledge. How you can have full knowledge if you are so defective? Just like a diseased man, he cannot say, "I am perfect in health." That is not possible. Similarly, if we are defective in so many ways, and if I want to become teacher or preacher to give you the truth, then how can I give? This is not possible. So we cannot hear from anyone who is defective. That is not pure knowledge; that is not perfect knowledge. If we hear from some defective, who theorize, "I think," "In my opinion," "Maybe," "Perhaps..." These are nonsense speaking. So almost everyone, the so-called scientists, philosophers, they simply theorize, "I think." Who are you, you are thinking like that? You are imperfect.

So we cannot accept the theories or the statement of some defective person. We should hear from the person who is not defective---perfect. Therefore our process of hearing or getting knowledge is from the perfect person. That is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are hearing //Bhagavad-gītā,// we are getting knowledge from //Bhagavad-gītā,// because Bhagavān Himself speaking. Therefore here it is said... Although it is said by Kṛṣṇa... Everyone knows that Kṛṣṇa spoke //Bhagavad-gītā,// and Vyāsadeva recorded it and then put it into the //Mahābhārata,// this statement. But here Vyāsadeva purposely says---one may not misunderstand---that this knowledge is perfect. Therefore he says, //bhagavān uvāca. Bhagavān uvāca// means there is no defect. You can accept it as it is and you get the full knowledge. This is the meaning of //bhagavān uvāca.// Many times he has said.

So //bhagavān uvāca,// and He is speaking about Himself, Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa, coming here. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]].

> paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ
> vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām
> dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya
> yuge yuge sambhavāmi 
> [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]

Bhagavān comes for this purpose, to let people know what is Bhagavān, not this so-called rascal incarnation. Just try to understand what is Bhagavān. If Bhagavān... Bhagavān means the six opulences in full.

> aiśvaryasya
> vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ
> jñāna-vairāgyayoś caiva
> bhaga itī ṣaṇṇāṁ ganā
> [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]

//Aiśvarya// means wealth, riches, one who is the greatest rich man. Every one of us... There are so many rich men, we are present here. But nobody can say, "I am the richest in the world." That is not possible. So one who can say and prove that he is the richest in the world, he can be accepted as Bhagavān, not these rascals, cheap Bhagavān. Cheap Bhagavān we don't accept. We accept Bhagavān Rāmacandra, Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa, because They did something which is impossible to be done by any human being. We are not going to accept cheap Bhagavān.

So Bhagavān means who is the richest, who is the most famous, who is the most..., who is the strongest, who is the most beautiful, who is the most wise and who is most renounced. Just like Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says that //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. He is the proprietor of all the //lokas. Lokas// means where the people or living entities live. So there are so many planets. Everywhere there are living entities. //Oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyam// [//Gāyatrī-mantra//]. There are Bhūrloka, Bhuvarloka, Svarloka, Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapoloka, Satyaloka, Brahmaloka. Seven..., fourteen planetary system. Then down: Tala, Atala, Vitala, Talātala, Pātāla, Rasātala. There are so many. This is only one universe. There are millions of universes. //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi. Koṭi,// we Indians understand: millions. There are millions of universes. //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam// [Bs. 5.40]. And each and every universe there are millions of planets, and each planet is different from the other.

Just like the moon planet. You are going to live there, but you cannot live there, because it is, the scientist says, two hundred degrees below zero, the temperature. So it is different atmosphere. Similarly, in the solar, I mean the sun planet, you cannot go there. But Kṛṣṇa can go there. That is Kṛṣṇa; that is God. Because Kṛṣṇa is not like us, neither His body is like us. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. And He went to the sun planet. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// Fourth Chapter. He says, //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. Just like here Bhagavān says, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogam.// This is a //yoga.// Similarly, this //yoga// system was spoken to the sun-god. //Mayy āsakta-manāḥ..., yogam...// What is that?

**Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:**
//Imaṁ vivasvate...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Imaṁ vivasvate yogam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. //Imaṁ yogam,// the same thing as Kṛṣṇa is speaking to Arjuna, the same thing was spoken to sun-god. //Imaṁ vivasvate. Vivasvate:// "unto Vivasvān." Vivasvān. The president of the sun planet is known as Vivasvān. His name is given. Just like we know who is the president of United States or India, similarly, those who are advanced in knowledge, they know who is the predominating deity or president of that planet. That requires knowledge. So Kṛṣṇa said that "I spoke to the sun-god, Vivasvān." So we cannot enter into the sun planet. That is not possible. It is so fiery. Temperature is so high. But Kṛṣṇa can go. Otherwise, how Kṛṣṇa went and spoke to the sun-god? It is stated. Therefore we are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. We do not interpret the meaning that "Kṛṣṇa, not this Kṛṣṇa, that...," and all, so many nonsense things. No. Simple meaning is that if Kṛṣṇa instructed the sun-god, Vivasvān, then He went there as He comes here. That is natural conclusion. And because He entered the sun planet and He did not burn down into ashes, therefore His body is different. Because if we go, if we enter such high temperature, immediately we are finished, what to say about speaking. So Kṛṣṇa spoke. These are natural, as it is, conclusion. You cannot interpret.

So therefore conclusion is: Kṛṣṇa's body is different from us. One who does not know, rascal, he thinks that Kṛṣṇa is like ourself. Kṛṣṇa, how He can be like ourself? If He entered the sun planet and spoke to the president of the sun planet, then His body is different. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]: "Because I look just like a human being, the rascal think of Me I am an ordinary man." Therefore the conclusion is: one who thinks of Kṛṣṇa as one of us, he is a fool, he is a rascal. Kṛṣṇa's body is explained in the //śāstra,// Vedic. What is that body? //Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1].

> ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis
> tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ
> goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.37]

These are the Vedic information.

So Kṛṣṇa has body, but not a body like us. That is stated in the //Vedas. Apāṇi-pādo javano grahītā paśyaty acakṣuḥ// [//ŚU// 3.18]. //Paśyaty acakṣuḥ.// He has no eyes, but He sees. Then what is that seeing power? That means He has got a different type of eyes, but He //has// got His eyes. He is not //nirākāra,// but not //ākāra// like us. His body is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Sat, cit, ānanda. Sat// means eternal, and //cit// means full of knowledge, and //ānanda// means full of bliss. So His body is made of such qualities, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.// Then you can compare your body. If we compare, if I think of my body, it is not //sat. Sat// means eternal. This body will be finished. So it is not //sat.// It is //asat. Sat// means which exists, and //asat// means which does not exist. Therefore how you can say Kṛṣṇa's body and my body is the same? No.

Then //cit. Cit// means knowledge, and our body is full of ignorance. We cannot understand knowledge. We have no knowledge immediately what is beyond this wall. If you ask me what is beyond this wall, then I will have to ask some of my disciples, "What is there beyond this wall?" Therefore it is not //cit,// not full of knowledge. But Kṛṣṇa knows, He says in the //Bha..., vedāhaṁ samatītāni// [[books:bg:7:26|[Bg. 7.26]]]: "I know everything past, present and future." When Arjuna enquired... Kṛṣṇa..., Arjuna, he is also playing just like Kṛṣṇa's friend. So he enquired for dissipation of the ignorance that "My dear Kṛṣṇa, You are saying that You spoke this philosophy, //Bhagavad-gītā,// formerly to the sun-god." Without asking Him, "How did You go? How did You return?" he simply asked that "Kṛṣṇa, I know that You are my contemporary. We are of the same age. And how can I believe that millions and trillions of years ago You spoke to sun-god?" So the answer was that "My dear Arjuna, at that time, because you are My friend, you were also there, but you have forgotten. I have not forgotten." Therefore He is full of knowledge. We cannot say what we did in our childhood. We have forgotten. This is one of our qualification, forgetfulness. But Kṛṣṇa says that "You have forgotten. Because you are living being, your nature is to forget. But because I am the Supreme Lord, I have not forgotten." Therefore His knowledge is perfect.

And then //ānanda. Ānanda// means pleasure, blissfulness. He is always... Kṛṣṇa, while He was present on this planet, He showed how to dance with the //gopīs.// He was always full of //ānanda.// Here we have got Kṛṣṇa. He is //ānanda-mūrti.// He is not //nirānanda,// without blissfulness. He is always with His consort, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī, and He is playing flute, and Rādhārāṇī is dancing. This is //ānanda.// So where is our //ānanda?// We imitate Kṛṣṇa, but we are not able to enjoy because we are in this material body. In this way, from //Bhagavad-gītā,// if we study //Bhagavad-gītā// nicely, then we can understand what is God. Otherwise you can go on speculating for millions of years or for many, many births, you cannot understand what is God. There are so many societies, theological societies, this, theosophical societies, but what do they know about God? They do not know, neither can know. It is not possible, because they are thinking with their imperfect senses. How you can have the idea of the perfect, of the unlimited, by your imperfect speculation? That is not possible.

Therefore the //śāstra// says,

> athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-
> prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi
> jānāti tattvaṁ ...
> [SB 10.14.29]

//Tattva// means the Absolute Truth. "You are Absolute Truth. Who can understand the Absolute Truth without Your mercy?" Just therefore Kṛṣṇa is merciful to Arjuna, and therefore He said... //Śrī bhagavān uvāca, mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha:// "My dear Arjuna, if you simply concentrate or meditate upon Me, Kṛṣṇa..." //Mayy āsakta. Mayi āsakta. Mayi// means "unto Me, Kṛṣṇa." //Mayy āsakta-manāḥ,// "Those who are attached to Me, that is perfect //yoga.//" That is //yoga.// The //yogīs...// You have heard the names of so many //yogīs,// meditation. The meditation is good, but most of them do not know what is meditation. Most of them. How? Now, they do not meditate upon Kṛṣṇa. Meditation means to fix up one's mind on the Supreme Personality of Godhead. First of all they do not know who is the Personality of Godhead. But the //yoga// practice, according to //śāstra,// is that. Here it is: //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogam.// This is //yoga.// In other Vedic literature that is also stated, the same thing. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. //Yogī// means who meditates. It is the business of the //yogīs// to meditate. But if you do not know upon whom to meditate, then what is the meaning of your //yoga?// Therefore I have seen practically in America, there are so many //yoga// societies. They close their eyes, and I do not know what they are meditating, but I have seen they are snoring. [laughter] And what they will do? Eh? [makes snoring sound] [laughter] This is //yoga// system. So don't be misled by these bluffers' //yoga// system. Don't be misled. Here is //yoga,// Kṛṣṇa, because //yoga// means to meditate upon the Supreme, //dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā,// mind fully absorbed, and they see Kṛṣṇa or Nārāyaṇa, the same thing. So,

> yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra-marutaḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair
> vedaiḥ sāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadair gāyanti yaṁ sāma-gāḥ
> dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yogino
> yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇā devāya tasmai namaḥ
> [SB 12.13.1]

This is Vedic //mantra.//

So //yoga// means to think of Kṛṣṇa. That is //yoga.// So it is also confirmed in the Sixth Chapter. We are reading Seventh Chapter. Kṛṣṇa says... Kṛṣṇa taught Arjuna how to practice //yoga.// Then He concluded His teaching on the //yoga// that,

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

Who is the first-class //yogī?// There are many different types of //yogī.// But who is the topmost //yogī? Yoginām api sarveṣām.// Who is that? //Mad-gatena antar-ātmanā:// "One who is thinking of Me always." That is perfect //yoga.// So that statement, that "One who is thinking of Me always, he is perfect //yogī,//" so that is now being explained. It is the conclusion of the Sixth Chapter, and in Seventh Chapter Kṛṣṇa explains how you can think of Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours. This is being explained. Therefore He says, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha.// How you can think of somebody else unless you are very much attached to him? Just like a boy is attached to some girl or a girl is attached to some... That is natural. So when he becomes too much attached, he always or she thinks always. Otherwise, it is not possible. To come to this attachment platform you have to learn how to love Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, how it is possible? Unless you love somebody, how can you think of him twenty-four hours? That is not possible.

So this //mayy āsakta,// Kṛṣṇa is summarily... But the //ācāryas,// they have defined how we can... We have got attachment. Every one of us got this propensity or the quality of attachment to others. The wife is attached to husband; husband is attached to wife. The son is attached to the father; father is attached to the son. Everyone. That attachment you increase, then to your family, to your community, to your society, to your country, to your nation. The attachment is there. You cannot say that "I have no attachment for anything." That is not possible. When... //Sannyāsī. Sannyāsī// mean //sat nyāsī,// one who has given up attachment for this false material world. That is the philosophy of Śaṅkarācārya. He says, //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.// Therefore he is advising that "You have got attachment for this material world. This is false." //Brahma satyam. Jagan mithyā:// he simply explains the negative side. But //brahma satyam:// "Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth, is truth." So attachment for that. You cannot give up the attachment spirit, but you have to change the attachment. That is freedom. We have got so many attachments for this material world. You have to transfer that attachment for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha.// He doesn't say that "You give up your attachment." How you can give up your attachment? That is not possible. He says, "Just transfer the attachment to Me."

So all of a sudden to transfer the attachment to Kṛṣṇa and give up our all attachment for this material world, that is called renounced order of life. But Kṛṣṇa says, "You do this," but it is not so easy. It is not so easy. Therefore we have to go to the person... //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. This is the //śāst...,// Vedic injunction, that in order to learn that art, how to transfer your attachment to Kṛṣṇa, you must approach to //guru.// He will teach you. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means that we are teaching people how to give up this material attachment and become attached to Kṛṣṇa. Attachment cannot be given up. That is not possible. Attachment should be purified. That is wanted. That is... Therefore the //bhakti// definition is given by Nārada Muni,

> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

Now, our attachment is on account of these designation. What is that designation? "I am American," "I am Englishman," "I am Indian." These are all designation, because the soul is neither Indian nor American nor this nor that. Soul is pure, pure spirit soul. These are material designation, according to the body. So if we become purified, //sarva upādhi-vinirmuktam,// that is called //mukti. Mukti,// the definition of //mukti,// means //hitvā anyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. Because we are staying at the present moment in this material state, we have got so many material attachments. That is, we are staying in a different way. We are living in the bodily concept of life, and in relationship with this body we have got so many different attachments. So //mukti// means when you do not stay in the bodily concept of life, you stay in your original state of life, that is called //mukti. Mukti// does not means that one has to acquire so many hands, so many legs. No. It is the change of consciousness. That is //mukti.//

Just like Arjuna did. He was conscious... In the beginning of the fight he was conscious of his relatives, of his family---means bodily. But when he understood //Bhagavad-gītā// from Kṛṣṇa, he said, "Yes," //kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]. In the beginning he denied to fight, but when he understood //Bhagavad-gītā,// he agreed, "Yes, I shall fight." //Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava.// "I am now full conscious." //Naṣṭo mohaḥ:// "This attachment, bodily attachment, is now finished. Kṛṣṇa, it is now finished." //Naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtir labdhā.// Because we forgot. I have already said that we are forgetful. This is our another nature. "Now my forgetfulness is gone," //tvat-prasādāt,// "by Your mercy. You have taught me //Bhagavad-gītā,// so by Your mercy my two things---that bodily attachment and misconception of life---is now gone. Now I know that I am Your servant. I am Your eternal servant, and it is my duty to carry out Your order. Therefore I agree." //Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]. "I shall now execute. You want me to fight---no consideration of my relatives or family---I shall fight with them." This is the conclusion of Arjuna.

So similarly, if you want actual life, this is a... This is a //bhramā,// or //mithyā,// life, this material life, means bodily concept of life, that "I am this body, and this family is mine, this country is mine, the community is mine. I have got to do for my family, I have got to do this, I have to go...," so many. This is due to attachment, and this is all false attachment. Therefore we have to transfer the attachment to Kṛṣṇa. That is called //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha.// This is //yoga// system, how to transfer this attachment to attachment to Kṛṣṇa. This is called //bhakti-yoga.// And this is the first-class //yoga.//

[aside:] You sit down there or stand there.

//Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha.// This is to be practiced. This //yoga// should be practiced, how to increase attachment for Kṛṣṇa. //Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan.//

You have to practice this //yoga.// How? //Mad-āśrayaḥ:// "Under Me. Or under My representative." //Mat-āśrayaḥ. Mat// means "Me," and //āśrayaḥ// means "taking shelter of." So either... But if you say, "Where is Kṛṣṇa?" No. //Mad-āśrayaḥ// means another thing: "One who has taken of My shelter." That is devotee, //mad-āśrayaḥ.// So either you take... That is not possible, because Kṛṣṇa is not here present. He is present, but we have no eyes to see. Although He is present here in this Deity, He is present here, but because we have no eyes to see, we are thinking, "This is made of stone," and some rascal will say that "They are going to see some stone." Because we have no eyes to see. So we have to learn the art how to see Kṛṣṇa, how to see Kṛṣṇa. So that practice, //mad-āśrayaḥ,// if we want to learn this art, we have to take the shelter of the Gosvāmīs or the devotees.

So Rūpa Gosvāmī says how this //āsakti// can be increased. He gives formula, //mad-āśrayaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa said, "Either you take shelter of Me directly or to a person who has taken shelter of Me." Just like electric power. Electric house, powerhouse, may be long away, but if the electricity is coming through some wire, and if you touch, immediately you will..., immediately in touch with the powerhouse. So either you touch the powerhouse or an wire, insig..., who is empowered by the powerhouse, you touch, you get the electricity. This is called //paramparā// system. //Mad-āśrayaḥ. Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ, yogo naṣṭaḥ paran...// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. These are all explained. So //mad-āśrayaḥ.// As soon as we... Because Kṛṣṇa is not visible at the present moment. He is visible, but we cannot see. So we take //āśrayaḥ,// shelter of His devotee. Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī gives his formula how to become attached to Kṛṣṇa. First he says, //ādau śraddhā.// First of all, faith, the beginning. Just like you have come very kindly to this temple with some faith that "Here is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Let us go there and see what they are doing," out of inquisitiveness or something. So this is little faith. Now you have to increase this faith. This is required. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]. How you can increase the faith? Those who are actually engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in devotional service, associate with them. Don't think that at home you will be perfect. That is not possible. At home there is no such facilities. Here you will get the facilities. Here the devotees, they are actually following the instruction of //mad-āśrayaḥ,// one who has taken the shelter. They are rising early in the morning. And at home you will think, "Oh, what is early in the morning?" [laughter] "Let me enjoy sleep."

So there is no such facilities at home. Therefore this institution is started. If you are serious about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if you are serious about increasing your attachment for Kṛṣṇa, then you should come and live with the devotees. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ.// And //tato bhajana-kriyā.// The //sādhu-saṅga...// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]]. Now they are chanting, they are having //maṅgala-ārati,// they are decorating the Deity, and so many things. Everyone who will associate, you will see. And then he will be inclined to be initiated. This is our practical experience. They will submit, "Please let me be initiated." This is called //bhajana-kriyā. Bhajana-kriyā// means... If he is serious about //bhajana-kriyā,// how to worship, then //anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt. Anartha// means we have learned so many nonsense things. They can be summarized in four items: illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. So //anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.// If you accept //bhajana-kriyā,// the activities of devotional service, then these things will be vanished. Then, when you are purified, as I have said, that //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]], when he is free from all these material bad habits, he is //mukta.// He is liberated. Then //ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā, tato 'nartha-nivṛt..., tato niṣṭhā.// Then your faith... Beginning was the faith. This faith becomes established. You can... Nobody can move you. //Tato niṣṭhā. Tato ruciḥ:// then you get some taste, how Kṛṣṇa consciousness is sweet. //Tato niṣṭhā tato rucis, athāsaktih:// then attachment. Unless you get taste, how you can be attached to Kṛṣṇa?

So these are the processes. So Kṛṣṇa is saying, summarized. They are explained by these //mad-āśrayaḥ,// those who are devotees. So in this way we have to increase our attachment for Kṛṣṇa. And when we increase our attachment for Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa says, //asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. Now everyone has got some doubt whether there is God or not, whether God is person or imperson, whether He is something... He has no idea. In any religion you take, ask him, "What do you know about God?" That he cannot explain. Because he is not in the platform, how he can be..., understand God? That is not possible. It is not... But we are confident what is God, what is His father's name, what is His name, what is His address---everything. No //saṁśaya,// no doubt! Everything complete. //Asaṁśayam.// We are confident that we are going to Kṛṣṇa, back to home, back to Godhead. There is no doubt, //asaṁśayam// and //samagram. Sama// means full. What is God meant? //Asaṁśayam...// [break] [end]
