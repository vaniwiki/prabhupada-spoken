**Prabhupāda:**
...meeting was very successful. You were present in Delhi? Very, very successful. All big, big men came, and they realized. We are going to have again that for two days. That is being arranged.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
In Delhi, yes. That will be nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
And who is thinking in that way? We are thinking like that. [aside:] Keep it covered.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
On the table there?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] [child talking and Prabhupāda says something in Hindi] [break] Dr. Ghora[?], you can say. The aim should be //saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. But if we don't care for this proposition... They do not know what is God, neither we don't want to satisfy Him: "He may be satisfied or not satisfied. Let us go on with our business." //Boliye?//

**Indian man (1):**
A lot of dangers will be there. We'll be putting ourself into trouble.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, we are in trouble. Even last war, when the trouble was too much, they began to go to the church. Even Churchill. And one gentleman---he is my Godbrother in Germany---he told me, after this war many German men and women became atheist. Everyone went to the church and prayed. Especially women prayed for return of their husband, brother, father. And nobody returned. So they thought, "There is no God. So forget about all these things." People became atheist.

So this risky civilization is going on. They don't want to know what is God, neither they want to satisfy Him. And our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is just the opposite, that "Here is God. You satisfy Him." That's all. "Never mind what you are, but by your occupational duty you satisfy Him. That is perfection." This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and this is taught in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa ultimately said this: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. In the beginning He said, //yat karoṣi yat juhoṣi yad aśnāsi yat tapasyasi kuruṣva tad mad arpaṇam// [[books:bg:9:27|[Bg. 9.27]]]: "Do it for Me." //Yat karoṣi.// It doesn't matter what you are doing. And very good work or bad work or anything, when He says //yat karoṣi,// means "Whatever you are doing, do it, but the result give Me." //Kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam.// This is His desire. And at last again He said that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.// This is the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā,// and if somebody would say that "Simply I have to satisfy You? Then I have to satisfy others also. If I do not do, then I will be sinful?" that, Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "Don't worry. If there is any reaction, not doing other duty, simply to surrender to Me, and if there is sinful reaction, then I'll give you protection. Don't worry." This is the conclusion.

And we are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, that's all, without any malinterpretation. Everyone is interpreting in his own way. But we are not interpreting. We are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. And it is becoming effective. //Bhagavad-gītā// was studied in the Western countries since a long time, since seventeenth century---but not like this. Before me, many //svāmīs, yogīs,// they came to the Western countries, and most of them spoke on //Bhagavad-gītā,// but not a single person was a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. But now they are becoming by hundreds, because the //Bhagavad-gītā// is presented as it is. This is the comparison. We have got Christians, Muhammadans, then Buddhist, Africans. Everyone we have got in our society, all very devout executor of our mission. Now here is Mr. Attar. Now he is Ātreya Ṛṣi. Whatever he is earning, he is spending for Kṛṣṇa. //Saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.// He is trying to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted.

So in the dictionary it is stated, "Kṛṣṇa is a Hindu god." He is not a Hindu god; He is God. But He appeared in India. He remained in the Vedic culture. Lord Buddha was also Hindu. And he was in Vedic culture. Later on he spread his own mission. That is also Hindu culture, //ahiṁsā,// nonviolence. Lord Buddha... //Keśava dhṛta-buddha.// The same Kṛṣṇa, His powerful //avatāra,// Lord Buddha. //Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare// [//Daśāvatāra-stotra// 9]. We offer our prayers to Lord Buddha. Christ was also for twelve years in India. He... Christ, the word //Christ// and //Krista,// there is similarity. He also propagated love of God. That is Kṛṣṇa. So we are spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and you are all Indians. It is your duty to see that the movement is pushed forward. //Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā// [SB 10.22.35]: "By your life, by your money, by your good intelligence and by your words."

Our mission is to spread the words of Kṛṣṇa. We don't manufacture anything. Why should we manufacture? Everything is there perfectly. What Kṛṣṇa says, it is perfect. If I manufacture something, that is imperfect because I am imperfect. So how can I speak perfectly, or how can I give perfect knowledge? It is not possible because I am defective: I commit mistake, I am sometimes illusioned. Why sometimes? Practically always. Everyone is thinking that he is this body---he is Indian, he is American, he is Hindu, he is Muslim. That is illusion. He is not this body. Similarly, our senses are imperfect, and so long we are in the imperfect condition, if we teach, that means we cheat. I have no perfect knowledge, and still, I am trying to teach---that is cheating. Nobody should try to preach with imperfect knowledge. That is cheating. That is stated in the //śāstra: bhrama, pramāda, vipralipsā// and //kāraṇa pāṭava.// We are qualified with these imperfections, and therefore we cannot manufacture. Somebody says "in my opinion." So what is the value of your opinion? You are imperfect. If the child says "in my opinion," what is the value? Therefore we don't say "in my opinion," "our opinion." We say, "Kṛṣṇa says this," that's all.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is... He says,

> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa
> yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

He says that "All of you, you become //guru.//" Just like I am requesting all Indians outside that I am alone trying to spread this Indian culture, why not you also join? You also become //guru.// So how to become //guru?// Not that simply by advertising that one has become //guru// all of a sudden. No. //Guru// means, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa.// Whomever you meet, you just instruct him in what Kṛṣṇa says, that's all---you become //guru.// It is not very difficult to become //guru,// provided we simply preach the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. That we are doing. We do not say that we are perfect, we have become God, or we have so many..., so many magic jugglery. No, we have nothing to do, that. No magic, no jugglery, no God. Simply to become servant of God, and whomever we meet, we speak the words of God, that's all. Then you become //guru.// This is our mission. That we may be imperfect, that doesn't matter. We are imperfect. Just like this child, he is imperfect, everyone knows. But if he says, "My father has informed me that this is microphone," so this knowledge of "is microphone" is perfect because he has received from the father, experienced father. Before hearing from the father, he may not know that this is microphone, but since he has heard from the father that this is microphone, and if he says to others that "My father has said, 'This is microphone,' " then people will accept this is perfect knowledge.

So we should follow this instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa.// So you, every one of you, can become //guru.// You may say that "I am not interested to become a //guru,//" but Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that if you are not interested, that is not very good. You should be interested. You must be //guru.// That is success of your life. You can speak the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, even to your family. That also //guru.// You are actually //guru.// The father or the head of the family is //guru// to the children, to the wife. In India still, the wife addresses the husband as //pati-guru.// And father is //guru.// That is natural. So why don't you become real //guru// to your wife, to your children, and instruct //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is? This is our mission. You sit down in the evening, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// and teach little instruction from the //Bhagavad-gītā.// See how the life changes. Is that very difficult task? //Boliye?//

**Indian man (2):**
No, no.

**Prabhupāda:**
So do that. Don't approach the cheater //guru,// bluffer //guru,// and be cheated. Stop this business. This has spoiled the whole spiritual atmosphere of the world. Take //guru,// the supreme //guru,// Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, when in //Mahābhārata// when Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira performed //rājasūya yajña,// in the //rājasūya yajña// one person is elected the chief guest. So in that //yajña// many big, big demigods were present, and Bhīṣmadeva was present, Vyāsadeva was present, and many, many other saintly person, //brāhmaṇa,// from the whole universe were present. And Kṛṣṇa was decided to be accepted as the... Everyone agreed to accept Him as the chief guest. And the Śiśupāla, he protested. Then everyone was angry to kill him.

So Kṛṣṇa is accepted the //guru// by everyone. By our //ācāryas,// recent //ācāryas,// Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya... I am not speaking of the loafer class, but those who are recognized //ācāryas,// Śaṅkarācārya... They accepted Kṛṣṇa as the supreme //guru.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So accept Kṛṣṇa as the supreme //guru// and follow His instruction and try to convince others. "Others" means even if your family members. That is success of life, //saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.// Why should you lead your life blindly? This human life is meant for enlightenment, supreme enlightenment, and this is supreme enlightenment: to understand the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā// and preach it as far as you can. If not, you can preach amongst your family members. This is perfection of life. [aside:] What is that verse? //Ya imaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati.// That is the desire of Kṛṣṇa.

**Nitāi:**

> ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ
> mad-bhakteṣu abhidhāsyati
> bhaktiṁ mayi parāṁ kṛtvā
> mām evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ
> [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]

"For one who explains the supreme secret to the devotees, devotional service is guaranteed, and at the end he will come back to Me."

**Prabhupāda:**
Next? //Na ca tasmān...//

**Nitai:**

> na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu
> kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ
> bhavitā na ca me tasmād
> anyaḥ priyataro bhuvi
> [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]

"There is no servant in this world more dear to Me than he, nor will there ever be anyone more dear."

**Prabhupāda:**
So this is the easiest process, that you learn //Bhagavad-gītā.// Don't misinterpret. There is no question of misinterpretation. They, by their, what is called, crippled mind, they misinterpret. Otherwise there is no question of. Where is the difficulty to understand? So Kṛṣṇa says, "Anyone who preaches this Kṛṣṇa philosophy, he is My dearmost person." So if you are recognized by Kṛṣṇa, then that is //saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.// That is wanted. //Boliye?// Any question? [pause] No question? Hmm? //Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā// [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]. There must be //paripraśna.// Yes or no?

**Indian man (3):**
Well, the question was the satisfaction of the God, that we satisfy our Lord. Now, what are the means to satisfy the Lord?

**Prabhupāda:**
That He says: that you preach, you become //guru.// That is already explained. //Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣu abhidhāsyati.// That is... He says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Everything is there. Where is the difficulty? If I say that "You do this. I will satisfied," you do that, you will satisfy me. What is the difficulty?

**Indian man (4):**
And the another part where you, which you said to preach Kṛṣṇa's..., to attain the satisfaction of. But what you have already said, that one should first know himself first, correctly, basic...

**Prabhupāda:**
Himself?

**Indian man (4):**
What Kṛṣṇa stands and what Kṛṣṇa means in the //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Why don't you...?

**Indian man (4):**
Yes. When we say we start preaching, so first one..., somebody has to know himself.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (4):**
Then he can come forward for preaching.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why don't you know yourself? Why you are in darkness? Kṛṣṇa says everything in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// In the beginning He says, //dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. In this body there is the occupier of the body. So if you think yourself that you are this body, that is your wrong. You try to understand that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.//" That's the fact. So this human life is meant for that purpose. So why should you not do it? Why should you keep yourself in darkness? That is very risky. If I keep myself in the darkness like cats and dogs, that "I am this body," then my life is very risky. By nature's way we are given this opportunity, human form of life. If we do not understand our position, if we remain in the same category, bodily concept of life, then we are missing the chance. After all, you have to change this body. It is not permanent settlement that you shall remain Indian, you shall remain American. No. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.// You have to change. Now what kind of body you are going to get, that you have to understand. That is responsibility. So this child, this boy, if he remains in darkness that he will continue this childhood body, and father, mother will take care of him---"I don't require to take any education"---then future life, when he will be young man, he will be not nicely posted for want of education. Then how miserable it will be. Similarly, if we don't take care of this education that "I am not this body. My future body will be different, and if I do not know what kind of different body I'll have to accept..." Suppose we accept some lower grade of body. Then what is my future?

So if we don't understand this philosophy as Kṛṣṇa teaches, //asmin dehe dehinaḥ,// "Within this body there is the occupier, soul," so if you do not understand, that is very risky life. Nature's way must go on. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. We cannot control over the nature's way. And we get our next body according to the association of different modes of nature. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya.// Everything is there. Why do you not study? Why you remain in darkness? What is this life? Is that very good life? You..., what is your name?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Mr. Sahani.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sahani, yes. Mr. Sahani, do you think is that very nice life, to remain in darkness for our future life?

**Mr. Sahani:**
Not at all.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. [says something in Hindi regarding child offering //daṇḍavats//] [chuckles] That is very good. That is our process. //Sāṅkhya-pūrvaka-nāma-gana-natibhiḥ// [//Ṣaḍ-gosvāmy-aṣṭaka// 6]. The Vaiṣṇavas, they chanted with a numerical strength, //sāṅkhya-pūrvaka. Sāṅkhya-pūrvaka-nāma-gana-natibhiḥ. Nāma// means chanting of the holy name. //Gana// means also prayer, and also //daṇḍavat.// Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, he took vow that "So many times I will offer //daṇḍavat.//" So these things are... If this child simply offers //daṇḍavat// to the Vaiṣṇava or Viṣṇu, so it will not go in vain. Even if he does not know any //śāstra,// simply offers obeisances, that will also be taken into credit. It is so nice thing. //Sāṅkhya-pūrvaka-nāma-gana-natibhiḥ kālāvasāni-kṛtau.//

So therefore Deity worship is recommended. So if anyone does not know anything, if he simply comes and offers obeisances, that is also nice. Therefore Deity worship is important for the common man. Even if he does not know anything, if he simply comes and offer obeisances, if he little dances with //kīrtana,// everything will be taken into credit. Then one day he will become a devotee. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. The //jñānavān,// the so-called //jñānavān,// they do not care for the Deity---puffed up. But Kṛṣṇa says this class of //jñānavān,// after many, many births, when he'll be actually //jñānavān,// he will offer obeisance. //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. It is so difficult and easy. A //jñānavān,// after many, many births, come to this conclusion, "Here is //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti.// I offer my obeisances." And the same obeisances can be offered by a child without being //jñānavān,// but the result is the same. If you touch fire after studying the physics and chemistry, and without studying physics and chemistry if you touch fire, the result is the same.

So our request to everyone is not to keep oneself in darkness and spoil the boon of human life, but try to understand your position and try to understand how to satisfy the Supreme. Everything is there in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is the summary of all Vedic literatures. This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And if you try to preach, then you become most recognized person of Kṛṣṇa. //Na ca tasmāt manuṣyeṣu kaścit me priya kṛtta...// And our mission is to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. //Saṁsiddhiḥ hari-toṣaṇam.// And He says, "In this way I become most satisfied." Then where is the difficulty? [break]

**Indian man (5):**
...our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is there any different methods?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, methods I have all explained. //Kṛṣṇa-bhakta// means do what Kṛṣṇa says. That is //kṛṣṇa-bhakti. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇanu-śilānam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. Just like Arjuna did. He did not like to fight with his cousin-brothers, but after hearing instruction of Kṛṣṇa, he said, "Yes," //naṣṭo mohaḥ,// "my illusion is now over." //Smṛtir labdhā:// "I have got my consciousness." //Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]: "I shall act as You are saying." Just see. This is //kṛṣṇa-bhakti.// We may have different decisions. That is natural. But when you agree to abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa, then your life is perfect. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that you have to agree. Kṛṣṇa does not force; He says, "Do this like this," and if we agree, then we are Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Guest:**
Can you satisfy equally as //brahmacārī// or //gṛhastha// or //sannyāsī?// Can you satisfy equally in whatever path you have chosen?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. The satisfaction is the point. So just like the head of the family, he is asking his wife to do something, children to do something, servant to do something. So if they are doing according to the order, then it is very nice. The head of the family is satisfied, and everything is going nicely. Anywhere, in office also. There are different officers, secretaries, managers, and the director, he has given: "You do this. You do that. You do that. You do that." So if they do their duty, then everything is nice. Just like in your body, here also we have got different parts. The hand does something, the leg something, the belly something, the brain something. What the brain does, the leg does not do. But the leg is doing for the satisfaction of the whole body. The brain is doing for the satisfaction of the whole body. Hand is doing for the satisfaction of the whole body. That is required. Not that what is brain doing, the leg has to do the same. The leg may do his own way, but the aim is satisfaction of the order of the... I ask the leg, "Please take me from this room to that room." That is leg's duty. I am satisfied.

So not that Kṛṣṇa is only one-sided. That they do not understand. Kṛṣṇa is the //īśvara,// controller of the whole creation. So if He gives you something to do for His satisfaction, you do that. It does not matter whether you are doing the same thing. The same example: leg is doing something else than the hand, hand is doing something else than the brain, but the real purpose is to satisfy the whole. So Kṛṣṇa is not asking Vyāsadeva to come and fight in the battlefield of Kurukṣetra. Vyāsadeva is doing his own work---he is writing literature, Vedavyāsa. He is asking Arjuna to fight. But although the activities are different---Vyāsadeva is writing //Vedānta-sūtra,// and Arjuna is fighting---but both of them are equally important. Kṛṣṇa says Arjuna, //bhakto 'si:// "You are My very dear friend," and //priyo 'si// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]], "Therefore I shall speak to you about this //Bhagavad-gītā.//" Kṛṣṇa did not say, "Call Vyāsadeva. I have to speak //Bhagavad-gītā.// He is learned scholar." No. Arjuna was not a learned scholar; he was a warrior. And he was a //gṛhastha,// busy in politics. Still, He called Arjuna, "Yes, I shall speak to you //Bhagavad-gītā.//" Why? //Bhakto 'si:// "You are My devotee."

So to become devotee doesn't require that one has to become very big scholar or very rich man. No. Simply you have to agree, "Yes, Sir, what You say I shall do," that's all. This is //bhakta.// To become //bhakta// is not very difficult thing. You simply agree, "Kṛṣṇa, what You say, I shall do," that's all. //Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]. That is perfection. So Kṛṣṇa wants this. This is the common formula for all. //Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣu abhidhāsyati// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]. "Anyone who speaks about this //Bhagavad-gītā,//" //sarva-dharmān pari...,// "he is very dear to Me." So agree to that proposal, that "We shall speak to everyone about this //Bhagavad-gītā// as Kṛṣṇa has spoken." Then you become a //bhakta.// That's all. You can do it in your office. You can do in your home. Kṛṣṇa does not say that "First of all you become a //sannyāsī// and you change your dress and become like these Kṛṣṇa conscious men." No. You remain in your position. But do this. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's... //Sthāne sthitaḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ// [SB 10.14.3]. You remain in your place, //sthane sthitaḥ.// Simply you hear from Kṛṣṇa or from Kṛṣṇa's representative and do it, that's all. Where is the difficulty? //Boliye.//

**Mr. Sahani:**
No difficulty.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is my request that you are so many respectable Indian gentlemen here, and we are preaching Kṛṣṇa's message. You come forward. You learn more and join this mission. It is not meant for Mr. Attar; it is meant for everyone, especially for the Indians. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that also: //bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]. //Bhārata-bhūmite// means in the land of Bhārata-varṣa. //Bhārata-bhūmi// is considered //puṇya-bhūmi.// So you are fortunate that you have taken birth as human being in India. It is the result of much pious activities. Indians are naturally Kṛṣṇa conscious. Now this gentleman, Mr. George, what is his name, full name?

**Devotee (1):**
Jimmy George

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. The Canadian Ambassador. He came to see me. He saw me in Delhi when our function was going on. He was speaking; he was so surprised. So this movement has got good potency, and every one of you join.

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari 'kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This is //para-upakāra.// The whole world is in darkness without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So enlighten them, //para-upakāra.// Human life is for //para-upakāra;// it is not animal life. To do good to others. Cats and dogs, they are selfish. But human life should be for //para-upakāra.// So this is the biggest //para-upakāra// movement. And it is very easy to take part in it. You don't require to be very expert. You... Everything is there. You simply carry the message like peon: "Kṛṣṇa says this. Kindly follow," that's all. We don't say that "I say this. I have manufactured this. I have become very big man, God." We don't say that nonsense. It is all nonsense. Simply carry the message of Kṛṣṇa; then you are perfect. In the Western countries they are little fond of //yoga.// So the //yoga// system is also spoken by Kṛṣṇa in the Sixth Chapter. But the conclusion is, when Arjuna refused, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me. This meditation, this //praṇāyāma// and //dhyāna, dhāraṇā, yama, niyama, dhyāna,// it is not possible for me. I am a politician. I have no time either"---he said frankly---then Kṛṣṇa satisfied him that "You are already the best of the //yogīs.//"

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gata āntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

"You are already //yogī,// first-class //yogī,// because you are always thinking of Me."

So this is the standard of first-class //yogī:// to remain always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and try to execute His will, that's all. That is first-class //yogī,// Kṛṣṇa says. You haven't got to get certificate from anyone else. Kṛṣṇa says. //Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gata āntarātmanā.// Who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa //āntarātmānā,// that is real //yoga. Yoga// means //dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. One who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa by //dhyāna,// by meditation, that is real //yoga.// And Kṛṣṇa says also. He confirms the same, that //mad-gata āntarātmanā, śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ sa me yuktatamo.// Then he is first-class //yogī.// This bodily exercise is meant for person who is in the bodily concept of life. One who understands that "I am not this body; I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. My duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa," that is first-class //yogī.// So become first-class //yogī,// first-class recognized person by Kṛṣṇa. Make your life success. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

So what was your question?

**Guest:**
Me?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guest:**
My question?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, question, you question something.

**Guest:**
It's just people... For example, could the president of the Coca-Cola company find the way to Kṛṣṇa, to serve Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, everyone can serve. Cola company?

**Guest:**
Coca-Cola company.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Coca-Cola.

**Prabhupāda:**
Coca-Cola.

**Guest:**
Somebody that manufactures a product which is basically destructive.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Coca-Cola company... Of course, we advise... Kṛṣṇa advises, //yat karoṣi.// It includes Coca-Cola company. But He said //yat karoṣi:// "Whatever you do." Kṛṣṇa said, "Whatever you do." So that includes all kinds of activities. But will the Coca-Cola company agree to give the profit to Kṛṣṇa? Then he is Kṛṣṇa conscious. The profit he will enjoy for his wine and woman, that's all, not for Kṛṣṇa. That is the difficulty.

**Guest:**
Can the profit of the manufacture of something which is manufactured purely for profit be turned to good?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, if he gives to Kṛṣṇa. Just like Arjuna. He fought. He killed. Killing is not good business, but he killed on the advice of Kṛṣṇa, and he became a //bhakta// by killing. Kṛṣṇa said, //bhakto 'si.// And what did he do? He killed, that's all. This is an example. Of course, //bhakta// never kills. Kṛṣṇa... Arjuna was not willing to kill. But when he saw that "Kṛṣṇa wants it, so this is my first business. Never mind I shall go to hell," that is Kṛṣṇa conscious. "By killing my brother I may go to hell. It doesn't matter. But Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied. That is my first business." Kṛṣṇa sometimes pretended to be sick. And many physicians came, they could not cure Him, headache. So He suggested that "I think if My devotee gives their dust of foot on My head, then I'll be cured." Then every devotee was approached that "Give your dust of feet. Kṛṣṇa wants it." Even Nārada. So Nārada said, "How it is possible I shall give my dust of feet to Kṛṣṇa? No, no, no, it is not possible." But when the person, messenger, approached //gopīs// in Vṛndāvana and they were informed that "Kṛṣṇa is sick. So He wanted the dust of feet of the devotee to be applied on His head. Nobody gave it. So we have come last to you," so immediately: "Yes, yes, take it, take it." Immediately. So, so much dust was collected. And Kṛṣṇa was cured.

So this is //gopīs.// Others thought that "If I give the dust of my feet to Kṛṣṇa, I may go to hell," but the //gopīs// thought, "Let us go to hell, but let Kṛṣṇa be cured." Therefore the //gopīs// are the first-class devotee. They do not care for themselves. That is recommended by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Ramyā kācid upāsanā vrajavadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā// [Caitanya-manjusa]: "The process of worship as it was planned by the //gopīs// in Vṛndāvana, there is no comparison. That is the highest devotion." They did not care for themself. They simply wanted to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa was playing flute at dead of night, all the //gopīs// were flying to Kṛṣṇa. His father, his husband---"Where you are going in this dead of...? Where you are going?" They didn't care. Society, friendship, love---all sacrificed: "We shall go to Kṛṣṇa." This is //kṛṣṇa-bhakti.// That is the highest perfection of life, to sacrifice everything for Kṛṣṇa: "Only Kṛṣṇa should be satisfied." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But that is not very easy job. But one can do if he likes, everything for Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says also, //sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. //Gopīs// did not care for social, for religious or family and nothing. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya.// They went: "Kṛṣṇa now is calling. Let us go." This is the typical example of //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ.//

So of course, it is not possible to become on the standard of //gopīs.// That is not possible. But at least we shall try to follow these devotees. Arjuna is there, //gopīs// are there, Uddhavas are there---many devotees. Lord Brahmā is there. Lord Śiva is there. Kapiladeva is there. The four Kumāras are there. Bhīṣmadeva is there. Prahlāda Mahārāja is there. Janaka Mahārāja is there. Śukadeva Gosvāmī is there. So //mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. If we simply follow these big, big devotees, then our life is successful. For authorized persons' name, to follow them:

> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ
> prahlādo bhīṣmo janako
> balir vaiyāsakir vayam
> [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]

Twelve: Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Nārada, then the four Kumāras, then Kapiladeva, then Prahlāda Mahārāja, Bhīṣma, Janaka Mahārāja, Vyāsadeva, er, no, Vaiyāsakī, son of Vyāsadeva. Not Vyāsadeva---son of Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Bali Mahārāja and Yamarāja. These twelve //mahājana,// we can follow them. //Sarvātmā snapane baliḥ.// Bali Mahārāja gave everything to Kṛṣṇa.
