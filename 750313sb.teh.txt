That how Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja, he was unwilling to accept the kingdom because he thought that "For me, so many men have been killed in the battlefield of Kurukṣetra. So I am so sinful, I am not fit for the throne." But all the great personalities like Bhīṣmadeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa and Vyāsadeva, and all of them requested, "No, there is no fault of you. It was fight. It was right. So you can reign over." There it is said, //niśamya bhīṣmoktam athācyutoktaṁ pravṛtta-vijñāna-vidhūta-vibhramaḥ.// He understood that "When such great personalities are giving their opinion, that it was no wrong on my part," then he agreed. //Śaśāsa gām indra ivājitāśrayaḥ. Gām indra iva ajitāśrayaḥ:// Indra, the king of heaven.

He ruled over this planet as perfectly as the heavenly king Indra does. How? //Ajitāśrayaḥ,// completely being devotee. So the king can rule over the country... Why country? The world, world over. If he takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa---//ajitā// means Kṛṣṇa conscious, God conscious---such person, as they are advised in the //śāstra,// then they can rule over the any part of the world or the whole world exactly like Indra, the king of heaven, he is ruling over perfectly. //Paridhyupāntām anujānuvartitaḥ.// So in this way Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira... [reading:] "Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, after being enlightened by what was spoken by Bhīṣmadeva and Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the infallible, engaged himself in matters of perfect knowledge because all his misgivings were eradicated. Thus he ruled over the earth and seas and was followed by his younger brothers."

So an ideal king like Yudhiṣṭhira, he can rule over not only over the land, over the seas---all over the planet. This is the ideal. [reading:] "The modern English law of primogeniture, or the law of inheritance by the firstborn, was also prevalent in those days when Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira ruled the earth and the seas." That means whole planet, including the seas. [reading:] "In those days the king of Hastināpura, now part of New Delhi, was the emperor of the world, including the seas, up to the time of Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the grandson of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. His younger brothers were acting as his minister and commanders of state, and there was full cooperation between the perfectly religious brothers of the King. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was the ideal king or representative of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa..." The king should be the representative of Kṛṣṇa. [reading:] "...to rule over the kingdom of earth and was comparable to King Indra, the representative ruler of the heavenly planet. The demigods like Indra, Candra, Sūrya, Varuṇa, Vāyu, etc., are representative kings of different planets of the universe. And similarly Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was also one of them, ruling over the kingdom of the earth.

"Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was not a typically unenlightened political leader of modern democracy. Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira was instructed by Bhīṣmadeva and the infallible Lord also, and therefore he had full knowledge of everything in perfection. The modern elected executive head of the state is just like a puppet, because he has no kingly power. Even if he is enlightened like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, he cannot do anything out of his own good will due to his constitutional position. Therefore, there are so many states over the earth quarreling because of ideological differences or other selfish motives. But a king like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira had no ideology of his own. He had but to follow the instruction of the infallible Lord and the Lord's representative, and the authorized agent, Bhīṣmadeva. It is instructed in the //śāstras// the one should follow the great authority and the infallible Lord without any personal motive and manufactured ideology. Therefore, it was possible for Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to rule the whole world, including the seas, because the principles were infallible and universally applicable to everyone.

"The conception of one world state can only be fulfilled if we can follow the infallible authority. An imperfect human being cannot create an ideology acceptable to everyone. Only the perfect and the infallible can create a program which is applicable at every place and can be followed by all in the world. It is the person who rules, and not the impersonal government. If the person is perfect, the government is perfect. If the person is a fool, the government is a fool's paradise. That is the law of nature. There are so many stories of imperfect kings or executive heads. Therefore, the executive head must be a trained person like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, and he must have the full autocratic power to rule over the world. The conception of a world state can take shape only under the regime of a perfect king like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira. The world was happy in those days because there were kings like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to rule over the world." Let this king follow Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and show an example of how monarchy can make a perfect state. There is instruction in the //śāstras,// and if he follows, he can do that. He has got the power.

Then because he was so perfect king, then, a representative of Kṛṣṇa, therefore, //kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. //Parjanyaḥ// means rainfall. So rainfall is the basic principle of supply of all necessities of life, rainfall. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. If you want to make people happy, both man and animal... There are animals also. They are... These rascal state executive, sometimes they make a show of benefit for the men, but no benefit for the animal. Why? Why this injustice? They are also born in this land. They are also living entity. They may be animal; they have no intelligence. They have intelligence---not as good as of man---but does it mean that regular slaughterhouse should be constructed for killing them? Is that justice? And not only that, but anyone, if he comes to the state, the king should give him shelter. Why distinction? Anyone takes shelter, "Sir, I want to live in your state," so he must be given all facilities. Why this "No, no, you cannot come. You are American. You are Indian. You are this"? No. There are so many thing.

If actually they follow the principle, the Vedic principles, then the ideal king will be a good leader. These are... And nature will help. Therefore it is said that during the reign of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, //kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ sarva-kāma-dughā mahī// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. //Mahī,// the earth. You get all your necessities from the earth. It does not fall from the sky. Yes, it falls from the sky in the form of rain, but they do not know the science, that how things are coming from earth by the different arrangement. Under certain condition the rain falls, and astral influence. Then so many things are produced---the valuable stones, the pearls. They do not know how these things are coming. So therefore, if the king is pious, to help him the nature also cooperates. And the king... If the government is impious, then nature will not cooperate. That we have also information in the Fourth Canto, I think. King...? What is that? Pṛthu. Pṛthu Mahārāja, yes.

**Nitāi:**
Pṛthu Mahārāja. When the earth was not supplying...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He was going to punish the earth. And he [she] said, "This is my duty. All the demons there are. I must restrict supply." So these people, they do not know. They think that simply by resolution in the Parliament they will make all, everything. And they may become all rascals. This will not make the world happy. They will simply deteriorate more and more. They do not know. Here it is said, //kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa also said, //annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Kṛṣṇa never says, "The factory will make the people healthy and strong." Never says. And these rascals are after factories. Then how the people will be happy? //Ugra-karma.// Everyone will be unhappy, dissatisfied, rogue, bachelor growth. Where Kṛṣṇa has said that "Open factories for economic development"? Nowhere you will find, neither in the //śāstra.//

Here it is said that all economic development will be complete simply by regular rainfall. //Kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ. Kāmam// means all necessities of life. They do not know. The modern people, scientists, philosophers, politicians, they do not know this. //Kāmam. Kāmam// means necessities of life. We have got so many things. But how it will be supplied? It is clearly said, //kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ.// And how //parjanyaḥ// will be regular? //Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Where is that program? Where is //yajña?// In the Kali-yuga other //yajñas// are very difficult to perform. There is no money. There is no qualified //brāhmaṇa.// Therefore this //yajña, yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. Those who have got brain substance, not cow dung, they will take this process, //yajñaiḥ.// Let everyone chant Hare Kṛṣṇa home to home. Whatever they have got, all right. Just begin chanting. Just see what happens.

We are trying to introduce this chanting. But the rascals will not take it. What can be done? There is no loss if they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa worldwide. Where is the loss? But still, they will not. And everything can be had. //Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī. Mahī.// Kṛṣṇa, He is the mother. Kṛṣṇa, how He has arranged this //mahī?// Everything is coming. Actually you will find that the rose flower is coming, the mine is coming, the gold is coming, the coal is coming, the petrol is coming. Everything is there in the //mahī.// And who has arranged it? Just see. //Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī.// And if there is regular water fall, then you get everything supply. And by performing //yajña,// you get regular water fall, rainfall. And in this age all other types of //yajña// is not possible. //Kalau...//

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva... 
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

So introduce this. What is their loss? If everyone, home to home or work to work, factory to factory... Let them... Let there be factory, but chant Hare Kṛṣṇa there. Let all the factory members be engaged in chanting, and the..., supply them //prasādam.// Just see. There will be no more strike. There will be no more communistic movement. Everything is there, provided they take it. Everything will be all right.

So this is not a sentimental fanaticism, religious movement. This is scientific movement for the good of the whole world. That we have to convince by our character, by our behavior. Then people will accept it. They think it is another type of religious... So religious means fanaticism. It is not that. Just like they fought, the Muhammadans and the Christians. There was fighting? What is that?

**Nitāi:**
The Holy Wars?

**Parivrājakācārya:**
Crusades.

**Prabhupāda:**
Crusades. These Britishers created this religious fight between Hindus and Muslims. Before that, there was no in the history, religious fight, in the history of the whole India. The //Mahābhārata,// Kurukṣetra fight was... That was political fight. That was not a religious fight on the basis of that "You are Hindu. I am Muslim. Therefore we must fight." There was no such fight. In the material platform your interest, my interest sometimes clash; there may be fight. But why fight on religious, mean God consciousness? If everyone is God conscious, where is the question of fight?

So that's all right. You can take it.

**Parivrājakācārya:**
Haribol. //Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [devotees offer obeisances] [end]
