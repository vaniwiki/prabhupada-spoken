**Prabhupāda:**
Fools, they assemble together, and people are unhappy. Democracy. Eh? Communist?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
But they have some sort of democracy themselves.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are dictators. Actually, Stalin's dictatorship was going on.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
It's all dictatorship.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Democracy is also dictatorship, but by elections. They elect a fool...

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs]

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
...and then he can be..., do whatever he wants. [indistinct] powerful as a king. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The sacrifice means the animal slaughter has to be made in the mosque, is it not?

**Devotee:**
Yes. I think so.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
It has to be made under special conditions. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...they can be turned into Vaiṣṇavas. [break] Young preachers, hopeless [break] ...real thing, and people follow, then everything is perfect.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes, then you can rule the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...side combined together it is very pleasing. [break] Eh?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Tehran used to be very beautiful before there were so many cars. Very clear, very clear. And the land, when I was a child, the land was very, very cheap here. So now it is, everything, very, very expensive and very polluted with car.

**Prabhupāda:**
Due to the cars?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes.

**Devotee:**
Everyone was a farmer, now everyone is a factory worker.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes. So it was very nice, very clear and very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Again let them become farmers. [break]

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
The mornings were largely very cool, very cool, and during the day it was very hot. The mornings were always very clear and cool. [devotees chanting //japa// in background] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Enquire.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes, we [indistinct]. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...questions.

**Devotee:**
We're going to help him write it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
In India, Tirupati, I think that Deity is richer than many kings in the world. Daily, 100,000 rupees, not less, daily. [break] ...few kings who has got so much money? If you organize, you can take the whole income for cause of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if you are really organized. That is possible.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Where is this temple?

**Prabhupāda:**
In South India.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
South India. [break] [indistinct] and searching, searching you'll find in modern [indistinct] very hard penalties. For industrialists, they are making life very difficult.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where? Where?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
In India.

**Prabhupāda:**
In India. Oh.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
One industrialist friend, Patel's friend, who has come to Tehran, I visited him. Very, very rich industrialist. He built a temple, very nice temple, he said, and then the government was not pleased that he has built a temple, and they came and searched his house and gave him twenty million rupees' penalty.

**Prabhupāda:**
For constructing a temple?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Well, for taxes and things. But their real reason was they were not happy that he was spending his money to construct a temple. I don't think even [indistinct] permit this Juhu Beach.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Juhu Beach temple? You couldn't get permit?

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't mind. Our work is going on. It doesn't matter. [end]
