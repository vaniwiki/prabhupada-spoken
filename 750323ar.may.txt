**Prabhupāda:**
...offering his blessings upon you. You are fulfilling his mission. He wanted that European, American should come here. It is all Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's blessing. Hare Kṛṣṇa. So there is no scarcity of space for keeping all the devotees?

**Bhavānanda:**
Everyone is situated...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Bhavānanda:**
Everyone is situated in rooms.

**Jayapatākā:**
Without these dwelling..., wall dwellings, there would have been no hope.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I said, [laughter] "You must complete, and whatever amount required, I shall pay." That I could analyze.

[temple bells ringing in background] [break]

**Jayapatākā:**
...you Śrīla Prabhupāda. Only by your mercy you have brought us to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I am simply messenger. Mercy is of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura and Śrīla Prabhupāda. Before your coming they predicted that "Somebody will bring." Maybe that somebody I am. [chuckles] Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura predicted. So anyway, Kṛṣṇa has given us nice place. Stay here. So you producing food grains?

**Jayapatākā:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sufficient? What about the fruit garden?

**Jayapatākā:**
Fruit garden, there is a... Many banana trees are producing their bananas, some pomegranate...

**Prabhupāda:**
You are getting banana, both unripe and ripe.

**Jayapatākā:**
Now they are all unripe. But they'll be ripe, //pakkā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, there is a class...

**Jayapatākā:**
Right, the //kacha kola// [green bananas] we have..., getting very small. We have mostly the ripe bananas.

**Prabhupāda:**
And //parwala// [pointed gourd]?

**Jayapatākā:**
//Parwala,// yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where you are producing //parwala// here?

**Jayapatākā:**
//Parwala,// oh, across the road we get.

**Prabhupāda:**
How many... [break] One who is sincerely engaged in the service of the Lord, He gives him intelligence, "Now do this, do this." Simply we have to become sincere servant; then all dictation will come from within. Kṛṣṇa is there is everyone's heart. So work sincerely and everything will make progress. Who has painted this picture?

**Acyutānanda:**
Puṣkara.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ohh. Very nice. So Ātreya Ṛṣi Prabhu, you are feeling all right here?

**Jayapatākā:**
You feeling all right here?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
The atmosphere here is sublime, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now make sublime management. [laughter] That is required now. We are now extended. We must manage very nicely. Of course, management means sincere service. Then everything will be all right. Still, we have to deal with the material world. We have to become little proper.[?] So in Calcutta the one lock was open. There was nothing. You said it is in Calcutta? Eh? Is it all right?

[aside:] You don't require fan. Therefore I planned two sides open, cross ventilation.

**Jayapatākā:**
Everything you plan is perfect.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. I imagine; Kṛṣṇa makes it perfect. I think, "It would have been nice if it would have been like this," but Kṛṣṇa... //Yei prasāde pūre sarva āśā// [//Śrī-guru-vandanā// 2]. Long, long ago, when I was publishing //Back to Godhead,// one sheet, I was thinking that "What is this sheet? If it would have been like //Illustrated Weekly,// then it would have been nice." Now they are coming like that.

**Jayapatākā:**
Now //Illustrated Weekly// is nothing compared to //Back to Godhead.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. [laughs] Better than //Illustrated Weekly.// I thought of getting some help from artist. For painting picture, I will dictate, and they will paint picture. Now Kṛṣṇa has got lots of artists. So depend on Kṛṣṇa. He can do everything, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. This new catalog you have seen? They have made nice catalog, Rāmeśvara Prabhu. Rāmeśvara Prabhu is very competent manager of the BBT.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes, he's first class.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And he works very hard. That is his qualification. What is the news of our Karāndhara Prabhu? He's not coming?

**Jayatīrtha:**
He came. The week before we left, he came three times to the temple, twice for the evening //āratik// and once for the Sunday feast. He came and listened to the lecture. So he is doing a little better. [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
//Scientific Basis?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes?

**Rāmeśvara:**
It is being printed now in America.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you wanted to bring it?

**Rāmeśvara:**
We may print it in India also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Rāmeśvara:**
But to get it in the selling right away we printed it in America.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have brought some book? You have brought some books?

**Rāmeśvara:**
Not too many of those, because they're still printing.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Jayatīrtha:**
We brought some copies of that //Ādi-līlā,// Chapter Seven. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is conclusion. Because he is Arjuna, devotee, he simply understood, "Yes. Whatever You say, correct. The demons or even the gods, they cannot understand." Why Arjuna understood? That he has explained in that Eighteenth Chapter. //Naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtiṁ labdhā tvat-prasādād madhusūdana// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]].

**Trivikrama:**
Is he never envious?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? [pause] [break]

**Paramahaṁsa:**
"Arjuna said, My dear Kṛṣṇa, O infallible one, my illusion is now gone. I have regained my memory by Your mercy, and I am now firm and free from doubt and prepared to act according to Your instructions."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. He understood that "Kṛṣṇa is divine. So whatever He says, that is my duty to do, not to judge Him on my platform." That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. One who does not take Kṛṣṇa in the same platform as one is but accepts Kṛṣṇa's personality, then he can understand. Otherwise, how one can accept it that a person has expanded many millions of universes like this? Immediately they will take as mythology, because he's thinking on terms of his capacity, not as Kṛṣṇa says. Therefore nobody could understand Kṛṣṇa. We took the simple method: accept Kṛṣṇa as He says. That's all. Finished. That is the main business. Our philosophy is simple because we take it, Kṛṣṇa's word, as it is, that's all. And we believe it firmly: "Yes, this is the truth." To understand Kṛṣṇa is not difficult. What Kṛṣṇa says, you accept it. //Sarvam etam ṛtaṁ manye yad vadasi keśava// [[books:bg:10:14|[Bg. 10.14]]]: "Whatever You say, I accept it. Not only I accept it blindly, but this very thing was accepted by such great personality as Vyāsadeva." [aside:] Anyone who wants to come in... Simple thing. Big, big //ācāryas,// they accepted Kṛṣṇa as He is. And why shall I not accept? This is //paramparā// system. If others have accepted Kṛṣṇa as He tells, and they have become big, big //ācāryas,// so what objection can be there from my part? What I am?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
They have some completely illogical argument. Just like those people in...

**Prabhupāda:**
Unfortunate. Illogical argument means unfortunate. Rascals. Therefore we say plainly, "You are all rascals." That's all. You have no discrimination. Anyone who does not believe as He is, he's a rascal, that's all. He may be happy or sorry, you don't mind. You don't make compromise. At least I do not do. If you have no full faith in Kṛṣṇa, then you are a rascal, that's all, whatever you may be. The Dr. Patel does not like this, but he does not protest to me. As others say, he protests by them. It is a fact. We have no difficulty to understand Kṛṣṇa and thus make our life successful. But we unnecessarily bring arguments, impediments to understand Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we are unfortunate, envious of Kṛṣṇa.

**Trivikrama:**
Envious.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
They say that... They become very agitated when we stress so much, in //Bhagavad-gītā,// that Kṛṣṇa is God.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means envious, envious.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Yes, envious. They say, "Why is it so...? Why do you stress...?"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān.// Find out. //Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān.//

**Paramahaṁsa:**

> tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān
> saṁsāreṣu narādhamān
> kṣipāmy ajasram...
> [[books:bg:16:19|[Bg. 16.19]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ajasram yoniṣu.//

**Paramahaṁsa:**

> kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān
> āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu

"Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence, into various demoniac species of life."

**Prabhupāda:**
All of them are going to Russia to take birth. Yes. Not Russian people are bad. That is a mistake. Some of them. Some people are good. That I have experienced. Otherwise how... [aside:] Don't do that. Otherwise how that Anatole came to become my...? And there are many like that, mostly like him. It is by artificial suppression that it has been advertised, "The Russian people are all Communist." That's not fact. That's not fact. Simply some rogues and thieves and demons, by threats... It is a country of, what is called? Terrorism. A terror. People have decided to leave this country, but they cannot leave. Mostly Russians, they want to leave that country, and some of them already done so. Many Russians have fled away. Many Chinese men have fled away. They don't like this philosophy.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Also the East Europe countries, Eastern Europe countries.

**Prabhupāda:**
Many countries. It is unnatural to deny God. It is unnatural. This is also Kṛṣṇa's another magic. All such people who had any doubt about Kṛṣṇa, they have been kept over there in Russia. Just like the other day there was a train crash accident. So all these rascals, they are brought together in that way in a train or two train, and they smashed. That is... Just like Kṛṣṇa did in Battle of Kurukṣetra. All the rascals were brought into the battlefield and finished. Therefore Kṛṣṇa... [break] [end]
