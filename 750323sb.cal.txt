"Duties or dharma executed by men are only so much useless labor if they do not provoke attraction for the message of the Supreme Lord."

//Dharma// means to carry out ones duty, Earlier also I have told that //dharma// does not mean, that we speculate on one thing and that is our religion, just like Hindu religion, Muslim Religion, I accepted it and that’s it, No, religion means, as it is explained in English, duty. You will have to do it, one cannot leave it. Just like a servant he has to take the orders from his master, that is his duty, or else the service will not last for long. Similarly, duty of a living entity as explained by Caitanya Mahaprabhu and Lord Sri Krsna is //mamai-vamso jiva-bhutah,// living entity is my fragmental part and parcel, and how is it fragmental part? like the //ansh// and //anshi.// Like my body, your body and there are different parts of the body, like the hands, legs, eyes, ears, different parts.

So what is the function of these parts, the function of eyes is to see, ears duty is to listen, if eyes don’t see then one is called blind, that is not is normal condition, that is not natural. It is the duty of eyes to see, if the eyes are unable to see then that is not normal, that is unnatural, it’s a disease, eyes duty is to see and serve the body. If body wants to walk, then eyes see and informs that walk from here, legs walk, different body parts have different duties, this is called religion. That is religion of an eye is to see, duty of legs is to walk. Similarly for living entity God says //mamai-vamso jiva-bhutah,// all the living entities all of us, God says we are his parts, So Just like different parts of the body are engaged in service of the body, similarly, it is the duty of a living entity to be constantly engaged in service of God, this is the duty.

We are parts of his body, so as God wants, he takes different kinds of service from different demigods, similarly he takes different services from different living entities also. So that is called devotional service //ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. Devotional service means every living entity has a specific duty towards God, God wants everyone to do a particular duty for him, that is service, just like God instructed Arjuna to fight, so to fight was Arjuna’s duty, that is devotional service //ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanaṁ,// in a friendly manner, not in animosity. Whatever Krsna has said you do that, that is what God also wants, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁśaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:6|[Bg. 18.6]]] whatever I am saying you listen to that, surrender on to my feet, this is called religion, that is why God says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya// all the other things that are going on as religion that are going on they are all cheating, the real religion is this //ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu- śīlanaṁ,// this is the real religion. As God says do that, God says //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]] this is your religion, our religion, God himself is saying, that always think about me //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto// become my devotee, pay obeisances to me and worship me, this is what God says, doing this only is our religion, and whatever else we are doing that is all irreligion, that is why in //Bhagavatam// it is said //dharmaḥ projjhita kaitava atra.// All the cheating type of religions, except devotional service, whatever else is going on in the name of religion, all this is //kaitava// cheating, real religion is this. We have made all our individual religion, so it is said //dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ,// we have speculated all our duties, this is my duty, no problem, do your duty, but at the end by performing your duty you reach the stage of devotional service than your duty is perfect, if not then //śrama eva hi kevalam// it is just hard labor, that’s all, the profit you got is labor, //lābha nā koilo kichu, ghaṭilo jañjāl// Narrottam dasa Thakur says, that we have concocted our duty for the body, there is no profit in this only entanglement. This is the thing, we are trapped in immediate duty and have forgotten God, the only profit we will get out of this is further entanglement nothing else, nothing else. After taking one birth, we will have to take birth again and again, because of being trapped with desires of the body, that is why it is said, one should ask what is religion, religion means as God is saying clearly this is the only religion //mam ekam// ekam, just like Mayavadi philosophers say that you imagine any form of God and the result will be the same, No, God does not say this, everyone is God’s form, you are also God’s form and I am also God’s form, but God has a special form, that form has to be worshipped, that is why God says mam means me, //ekam,// this Krsna form. Krsna means Vishnu //tattva//

> rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan
> nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu
> kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo 
> [Bs 5.39]

Krsna himself is the Supreme Person, this is there in Brahma Samhita, and it is described further //govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ..//

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam 
> [Bs 5.1]

Cause of all causes, the original cause is Krsna, //Aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]] God has explained in //Bhagavad-gītāMattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]], there is no one Absolute truth beyond me. So God himself is saying, we should accept this, understand this and once we understand Lord Krsna, it is not so easy to understand Lord Krsna, it is very difficult, but by mercy of sadhu and devotee association, if we understand some topics of God, then our life is successful, otherwise //śrama eva hi kevalam// it is only hard labor. Bathing in Ganges, applying Tilak, going on pilgrimage to holy places and worship, sacrifice, japa everything, but could not understand what is God, then all this is just hard labor, there is no profit, the profit will be there if one can understand Lord Krsna, //ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [//Nārada-pañcarātra//]. If one has understood Lord Krsna, then what is the need to austerities, his life is successful. //nārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [//Nārada-pañcarātra//], and if one is doing lot of austerities and sacrifice and japa etc, but did not understand Lord Krsna, then what is the profit in such an austerity. //Antarbahir yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim,// If you understand that always inside and outside you can see Krsna, then where is the need to perform any more austerity? this is the result of austerity and //nantarbahir yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim,// and after doing all the austerities, if one could not see the lord within and without, then what is the use of such austerity ? These are the principles of the scriptures. In //Bhagavad-gītā// also same thing is said, One who has understood God, then there is nothing left for him to understand //Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati// this is the instruction of Vedas, that understanding this one person, one can understand everything, that is why it is said, we follow religion, but by following our respective religions, //viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ, viṣvaksena// is Gods another name if there is no interest in topics about God then it is //śrama eva hi kevalam.//

By following religion one will become interested in Topics about God that is the result of following religion, all these will be explained later on, what is the meaning of religion

All this is explained, So generally religion is for humans, for animals there is no religion, these scriptures are for humans, not for animals, Animals will only bark nothing else. Supreme Personality of Godhead has made all these scriptures for human beings, it is explained in Caitanya Caritamrta, //Anādi bahir-mukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela,// living entity has forgotten God from time immemorial //Anādi bahir-mukha,// Living entity is only attracted to the external things, does not know God, from what time it has started, because the relationship between God and the living entity is very deep, it is not proper to forget, we forget, sometimes we also forget things, similarly, when one forgets and from what time he has forgotten he does not know, that is why it is called //Anādi, Anādi bahir-mukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa karila,// all Vedas and other scriptures which are composed by Vyasadeva, Vyasadeva is an incarnation of God, incarnation of Narayan. The living entity in this Kali yuga has forgotten God and they are accepting so much difficulty, formerly there was no need to write any Vedas etc, people had very good memories, that they would listen Vedas from their spiritual masters once and they could remember it, there was no necessity to write, because of the advent of //Kaliyuga,// Vyasadeva had to compile these Vedas, therefore his name is Vedavyasa. Formerly, students used to learn only by listening, therefore it is called //sruti,// So Vyasadeva, //ataeva kṛṣṇa,// Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa, Another name of Vyasadeva is Krsna Dviapayana, //ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa karila,// Krsna means call him a incarnation or his name is Krsna Dviapayana who composed all the Vedas and other scriptures. One should utilize this, what is human life and specifically who has taken birth in India, for him it is very proper, one who has taken birth in India and who has not studied the Vedas and Scriptures and not understood it, such a person has wasted his birth, there is nothing to say, it’s useless.

There is a very special objective in taking birth in India, that by learning Vedas and other scriptures one should understand who is God, what is his relation with God, how should we act in that relation, all these things are stated in Vedic literatures, that should be done, Just like Caitanya Mahaprabhu mentions //bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra,// one who has taken birth in India as a human being, not as an ass or a hog, but a human being, he should make his life successful //bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra janma sārthaka kari'// make one’s life successful, because he has got the chance, Only in India in every home there is //Gita// and //Bhagvatam,// otherwise nobody reads it or knows it, so much foolish we have become, that is why Caitanya Mahaprabhu specifically says that //bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra janma sārthaka kari', janma sārthaka kari'// means make your life complete, so how to make it complete, read all the vedic literatures nicely and try to understand, then only your life will be successful. What is the benefit in reading detective books, No, but we are attached to that only, //Tad vāyasa-tīrtham// it is mentioned in Bhagavatam //na tad vacaś citra-padaṁ harer yaśo pragṛṇīta karhicit, tad vāyasaṁ tīrtham,// In any scriptures if it is not instructed to sing the glories of God, that scripture is //vāyasaṁ tīrtham,// it a place of enjoyment for crows, crows, All the bad things that are thrown on the road crows are interested in that //tad vāyasaṁ tīrtham// and the scripture which Glorifies God is for swans paramhamsa, rajahamsa, lives in clear water where there is a lotus flower and the environment is very pleasing, that is where swans stay and crows live where all the bad things are thrown, this is the discrimination even in birds, some are swans and some are crows. Similarly, those who are not interested in Veda and other scriptures and are always engaged in other literature, like newspaper, detective books etc are all crows only //rajahamsa// will study the scriptures //paramhamsa,// this is proper, in India this is immediately possible. In India till today there are pandits, devotees who can read the scriptures and make it understand, so one should go to them and understand the essence of scriptures and make one’s life successful, not that study and just sit down, Caitanya Mahaprabhu says //janma sārthaka kari',// Firs of all make your life successful and then broadcast it to the world, I observe all over the world they are all engaged only in eating, sleeping, mating and defending we should tell them, this is India’s duty. Go to every corner of earth, big big scholars, saintly and devotee people, go and tell them, they listen, they want to listen very eagerly, that is why they have come, they have not come here to see your sewing machine, when industries made, sewing machines, cycle, that they have already made two hundred years ago, by following that road you will not gain respect, that we have progressed in Industries, what can you do in Industry, they are hundred years ahead of us, but if you give them devotional service, then they will respect you, that is not there, by making machine we cannot become big, we can make it here //bon gaya siyar raja,// In jungle //siyar// also becomes //raja,// that is a different thing, if you want India to be respected, then this mission of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu

> bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya janma yāra
> janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra 
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This should be India’s mission, copying the west and making skyscraper buildings will not make you any bigger, they are very much advanced in that. That is why this Krsna Consciouness movement is there, The real wealth which India has, devotional service, and //Bhagavad-gītā// is present, there is no difficulty, Everything is mentioned very clearly in Bhagavad Gita, explain these things very nicely to them, and you also understand and make your life successful and do //paro upkara,// simple thing, there is no difficulty. Caitanya Mahaprahu says all of you become guru, gurus are needed since everyone is a fool and an ass, to teach everyone, lots of gurus are needed, but not that guru which talks all nonsense and goes to the west and learns how to eat meat and here he is called a //sanyasi,// not that kind of a guru. Guru means as mentioned in the scriptures, just like Caitanya Mahaprabhu says //Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā,// Become a Guru by following my instructions, not this cheating guru, order following guru, who follow the order of the superior authority, that is a guru and not the one who manufactures his own thing.

> samit-pāṇiḥśrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham
> ābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam

These are the characteristics of a Guru,

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

One who is //tattva-darsi,// that is a Guru, who has seen the Truth, not this cheating guru, So Caitanya Mahaprabhu, Supreme Personality of Godhead and Krsna also says the same thing //ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]

//na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. So, If one preaches words spoken by previous //acaryas// and God then he is a bonafide guru, otherwise one cannot just become guru, So Caitanya Mahaprabhu says //Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]], By my order what I am saying, What is Caitanya Mahaprabhu saying? Same thing what God is saying. Lord Sri Krsna said //mām ekaṁśaraṇaṁ vraja// and Caitanya Mahaprabhu is saying that worship Krsna chant the holy names of God Hare Krsna, this is Krsna’s worship, there is no difference. And Ciatanya Mahaprabhu Specifically says

> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra’ ei deśa
> yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa’-upadeśa 
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

This is the disciplic succession, Caitanya Mahaprabhu is not instructing something new, he says whatever Krsna has instructed, tell that to all //yāre dekha, tāre kaha,// wherever and to whomever you meet, is this difficult or what, If every person starts doing this, that Supreme Personality of Godhead wants in //Bhagavad-gītā// that all should surrender at his feet, that is why I am telling you that you also surrender to God, that’s it and one becomes a guru, is there any difficulty //‘kṛṣṇa’-upadeśa// whatever Krsna is saying just say that, you don’t have to manufacture something //yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa’-upadeśa.//

So it is proper for everyone as Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, Krsna says, similarly Krsna consciouness movement should be preached all over the world otherwise whatever we are doing is simply hard labor without any profit. So //dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ,// Increase your interest and try to create interest in others, this is the instruction in the scriptures, so everyone together should explain others that //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam,// Krsna is the real God //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// and he wants that everyone should surrender at his feet and I am also assimilating his message and like peon am reciting //dante nidhāya tṛṇakam// all these big saintly persons do the same thing //Dante nidhāya tṛṇakaṁ padayor nipatya.// I am holding a straw in my mouth and very humbly and in a flattering way I am praying at your feet, this is the preaching topic. So one who is sane, will listen, that you are so humbly requesting to speak, then tell what you want to say, then one should say that //he sādhavaḥ,// you are very saintly, and you know and listen from all, this is my request //sakalam eva vihāya dūrād// whatever you have learned, throw all that away, throw all the far away //sakalam eva vihāya dūrād// then what should I do ? //Caitanya-candra-caraṇe kurutānurāgam,// just follow what Caitanya Mahaprabhu is instructing, this is preaching, this is the duty of a preacher. Kali yuga is an age of quarrel so by forcing too much everything will be spoiled, so one has to flatter them, that I am falling at your feet and flattering you by holding a straw in my mouth I am requesting that you are very saintly and learned, kindly forget everything, only listen to what Caitanya Mahaprabhu has said, so what has Caitanya Mahaprabhu said? //yāre dekha, tāre kaha ‘kṛṣṇa’-upadeśa,// whomever you meet, in market, at home, in train, aeroplane, this is what //Bhagavad-gītā// says //sarva-dharmān parityajya// chant Hare Krsna, that’s all you become guru. So //dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ// and one more topic about religion, religion means duty.

So every individual has his own duty, just like I explained earlier, so in a real human society there should be four divisions //Caturvarnyam maya sristam gunakarmavibagasah,// this must be there Brahman, //kshatriya, vaishya, sudra.// Who is a Brahman, who has good intelligence and he has practiced austerities //satyam śaucam śama dama titikṣāārjavam jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]] this should be taught, one class of men there must be //brahmans,// otherwise who will guide the society, everyone has become //sudra,// so who will guide, in kali //yuga// this is the difficulty //kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ// there is no Brahman, who will teach, there is no brain, //sudra// means legs, Brahman means head, and ksatriya means arms, and viashya means stomach, just like in a body there are four division, similarly society should be divided into four divisions, And there should be cooperation between these divisions, then it is a perfect society. Just like you and I have, brain, hands, legs, stomach, if they work in cooperation then body is healthy every work will be done properly.

That is why God says //Caturvarnyam maya sristam// these //brahmans, kshatriya// all these, modern thinking is remove all this and all become //sudras,// there is no profit in that, All the //sudras// have taken the position in Government, what can they do, what can a //sudra// do, //ksatriya// is needed. That is why the situation is miserable. All there four divisions of religion, this is called //Varnashram// religion, we have given a name Hindu, it is not Hindu, Hindu is the name given by Muslim people, the name in the scripture is //Varnashram// religion, it is not Hindu religion, //Varnashram,// four //varnas// and four ashram Brahman, //kshatriya, vaisaya, sudra// and //brahmachari, grahasta, vanaprasta// and //sanyasa.// All these eight things have to go in a very organized way, in Kali yuga this is also impossible and there are no proper Brahman, //kshatriya// and //vaisya,// that is why God has instructed in the scriptures that never mind if you are a Brahman, //sudra, kshatriya// or whatever you are, your work is to satisfy God this is the real duty //varnashram vibhagashya,// this has been concluded in Niamisharanya amongst, big big, //brahmans// and sages, //atha pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭha,// this is explained by Suta Goswami, you are all //dvija-śreṣṭha// big big //brhamans// are present here, So as per the scriptures this is the instruction //Ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhāḥ varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ,// same //varṇāśrama// has been spoken here, four varnas and four ashram. //varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ, svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]], the same thing is here, you be a Brahman or be a brahmacari or sudra or grahasta or whatever you are, your real duty is //saṁsiddhir.// If you want to attain perfection //saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// then you have to satisfy God. In Kaliyuga having these divisions //brhaman, kshatriya, vaisya, sudra, brahmachari, grahasta, vanaprastha// is very difficult, that is why one work is suitable for all that is //hari-toṣaṇam,// satisfy God, then you will attain perfection //saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam.// In Kali //yuga,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead will be satisfied by simple process, why and how ?

> harer nāma harer nāma
> harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva
> nāsty eva gatir anyathā 
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

That is why as per the direction of the scriptures we are in a extremely fallen condition, that is why //harer nāma,// chanting the name of Supreme Personality of God head, not any name, //harer nāma,// that is why it is specifically mentioned //harer nāma,// Supreme Personality of Godhead has many names, Rama, Nrshima, etc many many names, take any name. Recently I was in Tehran, that is a muslim country, So somebody argued, that why should we take your Krsna’s name, we said don’t take Krsna’s name, but God has many name, what name do you understand, he said, we call him Allah, So take Allah’s name, but take God’s name only and nothing else //nama namakari bahula nija sakta sakti.// So accept God’s name as mentioned in the scriptures, and make your life perfect, there is no difficulty, and if you do not take God’s name and do not understand him //dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ viṣvaksena-kathāsu,// you did not accept God, then this life is wasted //śrama eva hi kevalam,// this is the direction of the scriptures. So in //Kaliyuga,// this is very easy, chant

> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare
> Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare,

this is,

> kirtaniya sada hari 
> satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ
> yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]

This is mentioned in Bhagavad-gītā, that chant my (Krsna’s) name every moment //satataṁ, satataṁ// means twenty four hours a day, while walking, sitting, sleeping, eating, drinking all the time Hare Krsna

> satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ
> yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā
> nitya-yuktā upāsate
> [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]

All these are the directions in scriptures, by accepting the scriptures, one will attain to perfection, otherwise it is not possible otherwise it is only //śrama eva hi kevalam.// If we leave the direction of the scriptures aside then //na sa siddhim avāpnoti//

> yaḥśāstra-vidhim utsṛjya
> vartate kāma-kārataḥ
> na sa siddhim avāpnoti
> [[books:bg:16:23|[Bg. 16.23]]]

He can never attain perfection, //na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim// he is not purified and there is no question of reaching ultimate position. So in scriptures instructions are there, Ciatanya Mahaprabhu has preached //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam// it is a very easy method, this is our request that please accept this and chant, your life will be successful. Thank you very much
