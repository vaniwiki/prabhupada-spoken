**Prabhupāda:**
...Germany. Yes.

**Devotees:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So anyone, our men can do it immediately.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Acyutānanda can do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Anyone can do it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda, now that brass dome is on top.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The big one.

**Jayapatākā:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayapatākā:**
Do you think that we should make these marble here, on the side?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, very nice. [end]
