**Nitāi:** "Desiring to understand the glory of Rādhārāṇī's love, the wonderful qualities in Him that She alone relishes through Her love, and the happiness She feels when She realizes the sweetness of His love, the Supreme Lord Hari, richly endowed with Her emotions, appeared from the womb of Śrīmatī Śacīdevī, as the moon appears from the ocean."

**Prabhupāda:**

> śrī-rādhāyāḥ praṇaya-mahimā kīdṛśo vā anayaivā-
> svādyo yenādbhuta-madhurimā kīdṛśo vā madīyaḥ
> saukhyaṁ cāsyā mad-anubhavataḥ kīdṛśaṁ veti lobhāt

So the love affairs between Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā... That we have already understood, that Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa combined together is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptam// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. //Tad-dvayam. Dvayam// means two, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. They are one. There is no difference, energy and the energetic. So Rādhārāṇī is the energy, pleasure energy, of Kṛṣṇa. So when Kṛṣṇa... We have explained this. When Kṛṣṇa wants pleasure, He cannot derive it from anything material. We should not misunderstand that Kṛṣṇa is ordinary human being and He is enjoying like us. Completely different. Rādhārāṇī is the manifestation of Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]].

So when Kṛṣṇa, Para-brahman... Kṛṣṇa is described by Arjuna, Para-brahman. So when the Para-brahman wants to enjoy... The Māyāvādī philosophers, they cannot conceive that Para-brahman also enjoys; therefore they think of Para-brahman as imperson. So that is not the fact. Brahman, Paramātmā, then Bhagavān. Therefore Bhagavān is Para-brahman. That is accepted by Arjuna, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. So Brahman is spiritual, undoubtedly, but more than Brahman is Paramātmā, and more than Paramātmā is Para-brahman, Kṛṣṇa. //Yad advaitaṁ brahma upaniṣadi// [[books:cc:adi:1:3|[Cc. Ādi 1.3]]]. If you study the //Upaniṣads,// then you can realize Brahman. And if you practice //yoga,// then you can realize Paramātmā. And if you practice //bhakti-yoga,// then you can realize the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the process. The more you advance... Just like the sunshine. Sunshine and the sun globe or the sun-god---they are of the same quality, heat and light. But the sunshine is not the sun globe, neither the sun globe is the sun-god. It is this..., therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy, //acintya-bhedābheda,// inconceivable one and different simultaneously. So when you go to the platform of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead... As Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

You have to understand Kṛṣṇa //tattvataḥ,// in truth, not superficially. Then you'll misunderstand. Without understanding Kṛṣṇa, if we try to understand Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with Rādhārāṇī, that is foolishness. But they do not know Kṛṣṇa. How can understand His pastimes with the //gopīs?// That is foolishness. Therefore we have to understand Kṛṣṇa first of all, and Kṛṣṇa Himself, explaining Himself. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa does not speak anything about His pastimes with Rādhārāṇī. That is strictly prohibited. You never find Kṛṣṇa is speaking about His pastimes with the //gopīs// or with Rādhārāṇī. No. He's officially speaking about Himself, "I am this, I am that." //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. First of all try to understand Kṛṣṇa. Thoroughly study //Bhagavad-gītā,// and after studying //Bhagavad-gītā,// if you are fortunate enough to understand what is Kṛṣṇa, then, Kṛṣṇa says, surrender. That is the beginning of understanding Kṛṣṇa. Don't try to understand the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with the //gopīs.// Just like if you make a friend ordinarily, if you become intimate friend, then you can understand about his household affairs. If you are newly a gentleman introduced with another gentleman, you cannot ask him, "What is the affair in your household, or with your wife, or with your beloved?" That you cannot ask, neither it is possible to understand.

So the foolishness is going on that without understanding Kṛṣṇa, there are so-called rascal foolish poets, They are describing Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with Rādhārāṇī. That is the cause of falldown of the so-called Vaiṣṇavism. Without understanding Kṛṣṇa, they want to understand the pastimes of... You'll find in your country also. I have seen one book written by one Bhaṭṭācārya about the pastimes of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, and the covering page is Rādhārāṇī's picture naked. So these rascals have made so much havoc, and this book is published by the United Nations. I have seen one book in France. I think some of you might have seen. Bhagavān, you have seen? Hmm?

**Bhagavān:**
Vidyāpati.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway, this kind of literature... Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to read //Gītā-Govinda,// Caṇḍīdāsa, amongst with His confidential devotees. The //Gītā-Govinda,// the loving affairs of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, it is not for the neophyte student. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu... You'll find Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teachings... Generally, He was talking with Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, He was talking with Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, He was talking with Rāmānanda Rāya---but the subject matter was not the same. When He was talking officially with the Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, there is no talk about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with Rādhārāṇī. Simply on the basis of //Vedānta// He was talking. But when He was talking with Rāmaṇanda Rāya, He talked about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with Rādhārāṇī.

So we should be very careful that from the very beginning... Just like the professional //Bhāgavata// readers. The //Bhāgavata// reading means describing //rasa-līlā.// Whenever you find there is //Bhāgavata// reading, they are describing. I have seen one big Gosvāmī. He was professional //Bhāgavata// reader, and whenever... He would speak very nicely on //rasa-līlā,// and after describing //rasa-līlā, Bhāgavata// reading, he would come for recreation and smoke cigarette. I have seen it. So this kind of //Bhāgavata// reading will not help you. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]: "If you are actually advancing in devotional service, then the symptom will be that you'll have no more material hankerings." That is real... So if you actually hear about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with Rādhārāṇī, then //hṛd-roga-kāmān apahinoti,// then our heart disease, lusty desires, will vanish. That is the result. I have repeatedly said. So if you become more lusty by seeing the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa with Rādhārāṇī or hearing, that means you are not fit. Stop it. Stop it. Don't be foolish.

So in the spiritual platform, the everything are there, but they are different in quality. Just like iron is also metal and gold is also metal, but the quality is different; similarly, don't take that Kṛṣṇa's loving affairs with Rādhārāṇī is exactly like our loving affair with our girlfriend. No. It is not like that. One is gold, and one is iron. Don't minimize the value. Therefore Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī has described that it is //ahlādinī-śaktiḥ. Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktiḥ.//

So this //hlādinī-śakti// is being described in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Therefore //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is the postgraduate study of highly elevated devotees. Ordinary devotees, they cannot understand. I have seen one professional reader, he was reading //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// but he did not believe in it. Just see. Because he cannot understand. He cannot understand it. He plainly said, "These are only imaginary descriptions. There is no fact in it." I have seen it. So how one can understand this is fact unless one has understood what is spirit? Just like in your country, big, big professors, they do not believe in the spirit. They simply think of this body. So how they can understand about Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and Their pastimes, all spiritual affairs? So first of all we must understand what is spirit and what is Kṛṣṇa and what is Rādhārāṇī, and then we try to understand what is Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī's loving affairs.

So here it is said that Kṛṣṇa is feeling how Rādhārāṇī is so much attracted. So much attracted. That is feeling. Now, Kṛṣṇa is omniscient. He knows everything. Why He should feel like that? The feel that He knows, but for our understanding, He is displaying, He's manifesting Himself, that "Rādhārāṇī's loving affairs is so great and unlimited, even though I am omniscient, I cannot understand it." Just like Lord Rāmacandra. Lord Rāmacandra, He is Supreme Personality of Godhead. Why He felt so much separation that to rescue Sītādevī He fought with Rāvaṇa? He's self-sufficient. Why He should feel separation from Sītādevī? This question may be raised. But actually there are different phases of loving affairs, and the separation is also one of them. The separation, feeling of separation, is one of them. We have got experience in our present life that intense love... Still there is feeling of separation. All these things are there in the spiritual world. Only perverted reflection of those spiritual feelings are manifested here in this material world. Therefore it is called perverted reflection. But everything is there, but they are not material. We should always understand that. Kṛṣṇa is perfect, Rādhārāṇī is perfect, and They are always constantly accompanied. Then why there is separation? And still, there is separation. So these are very high-grade understanding.

So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu means Kṛṣṇa feeling separation, or Rādhārāṇī feeling... //Rādhā-bhava-dyuti-suvalitam// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taken the position of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī---how to feel separation from Kṛṣṇa. This is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore it is said, //śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya rādhā kṛṣṇa nahe anya.// If you simply worship Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then you will be able to worship both Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of these verses.

So //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// author, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, is describing the cause of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's appearance. The cause is that Kṛṣṇa wanted to know, "What is there in Rādhārāṇī?" He is Madana-mohana. Kṛṣṇa's another name is... He's attractive. Kṛṣṇa is attractive to everyone; even He is attractive to Cupid, Madana. Madana is attractive in the material world, and He is Madana-mohana. And Rādhārāṇī is Madana-mohana-mohinī, means She attracts even the Madana-mohana. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is trying to understand, "What is there in Rādhārāṇī that She attracts? I attract the whole universe, and She attracts Me."

So with this feeling, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //tad-bhāvāḍhyaḥ lobhāt.// These are all transcendental loving affairs. //Lobhāt:// there is greediness to understand. //Tad-bhāvādhyaḥ samajani:// "He appeared in the womb of mother Śacī." //Samajani śacī-garbha-sindhau harīnduḥ.// Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is like the moon. So we have established this temple, Māyāpur-candrodaya. So this is the idea, that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is just like moon. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He appeared in this land of Māyāpur; therefore He is said here as "the moon." Therefore we say //candra,// Māyāpur-candra. Now, as Śrī Māyāpur-candra is rising... Rising. Rising means He is to distribute the moonshine all over the world. This is the idea, moonshine. //Śreyaḥ-kairava candrikā-vitaraṇam. Śreyaḥ-kairava.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally said. Don't keep Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu compact in your room and take some monetary profit. This is not required. This is not required.

You must allow Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to rise more and more so that this sun, moonshine, may be distributed all over the world. That is wanted. Therefore this temple is situated. Of course, we shall try to construct a very nice temple for Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This morning we were thinking of this. So from this place, this moon, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, will distribute. //Śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam.// The Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's Hare Kṛṣṇa movement... //Paraṁ vijāyate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.// This is spoken by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. //Vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam.// This is real enlightenment. People all over the world, they are in darkness. The moonshine will enlighten them. They are all foolish, //mūḍha.// That is described in //Bhagavad-gītā// also:

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuri-bhāvam āśritaḥ
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

These foolish persons at the present moment... It is very, very much regrettable that they are passing on as very learned scholar, as philosopher, politician, economist. But according to Kṛṣṇa's statement in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// they are all fools and rascals. Why? //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ pra...// They are not surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa came, appeared, upon this planet in this universe to canvass that "You surrender." //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. But they did not. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as a devotee of Kṛṣṇa... He's Kṛṣṇa.

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne...
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]

He's Kṛṣṇa Himself. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. First of all He came as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and He demanded as God's order, "You surrender." But people did not do it. Therefore Kṛṣṇa has again come in the form of devotee, //kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne,// and now He is ready to give you not only Kṛṣṇa, but love of Kṛṣṇa, freely. Take it and distribute it all over the world. That is wanted.

Thank you very much.
