**Prabhupāda:**
...otherwise, we recommend everyone become //sannyāsa.// What is the use of not becoming? [laughter] We are giving up this world. We are preparing ourself for entering into the family of Kṛṣṇa. So why should we be very much anxious to maintain this family? So actually... Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says, "I'm not a //sannyāsī.// I'm not a //sannyāsī.// I'm not a //gṛhastha.// I'm not a //brahmacārī.//" These four..., eight //varṇāśrama-dharma// is unnecessary for spiritually. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was speaking with Rāmānanda Rāya---you'll find in the //Teachings of Lord...//---as soon as he suggested //varṇāśrama-dharma,// Rāmaṇanda Rāya, immediately Caitanya...: "It is not very important. If you know better than this, you go on." He did not give any, much stress on this //varṇāśrama-dharma.// But for regulated life, that is required. And... Ultimately, it is not required. So it is not recommended for ordinary person. But this is also unnecessary. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching is so sublime that such things, which is the beginning of human life, that is also unnecessary. //Ihā bāhya āge kaha āra. Bāhya āge,// this is superfluous. "You speak something higher than [indistinct]." So that is not very easy thing. First of all, we have to live very regulated life. //Sannyāsa// life is that regulated life. And then we can enter into the real life. That is idea. So anything more?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Any more on those five points? [break]

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Shut temple. Moving temples.

**Satsvarūpa:**
He's questioning about the selling... There's one resolution that all the paintings...

**Brahmānanda:**
Let Prabhupāda explain his point.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Brahmānanda:**
You want to expand this point of moving temples, rather than permanent temples?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Moving temple means through bus, going from one place to another. That is better. From one temple, they go from village to village, town to town. That will be nice. Caitanya Mahāprabhu personally did not establish any temple. He was moving. Is it not? So that's all right. We should be very much cautious to establish a new center. And if one establishes, he cannot close it. This should be the principle. That's all. Don't whimsically open a temple and close next day. No. Don't do that. If once established, it must be maintained, at any cost. Hmm. Is that alr...

**Satsvarūpa:**
So the question that Mahendra asked was... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...He was converting all his sons to be //sannyāsī.// So he cursed him that: "You cannot stay anywhere more than three minutes." That's it.

**Brāhmaṇana:**
Prabhupāda, you also show that example.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Brahmānanda:**
You're also showing that example.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Although there is no restriction, still I do not stay more than three weeks even.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's very hard to keep you in one place.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Hmm.

**Satsvarūpa:**
I'll read on. The next ... [end]
