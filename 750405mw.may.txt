[bad recording]

**Prabhupāda:**
...seeking the necessities of the body, but //kāṣṭān,// with great labor. This is civilization. //Kāṣṭān karma.// The ultimate end is sense gratification, which the dogs and hogs also enjoy without any hard labor, and they think that after working very, very hard, twenty-four hours, and driving the motorcars in three hundred miles speed, this is... The end is the same---sex, that's all, which the cats and dogs enjoy in the street. And they have made this civilization, you see. Working very hard, and enjoy the sex. Is it not?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What else they are getting?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Well, they say that civilization is more than that. It's...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Well, culture...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that culture? Your culture is the same---sex. As soon as there was no light, immediately there was pregnancy. That is the statistic record.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, in the blackout.

**Devotee:**
New York blackout.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "No business. Come on. Let us enjoy sex." That's all. This is their civilization. //Yan-maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Most abominable sex life---this is civilization.

**Nalinī-kānta:**
They say that in the human form of life we can enjoy sex life better than the cats and the dogs.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is imagination. They enjoy without any restriction, and you have to make so many arrangement. You require apartment, nice bed, nice this, so many. So where is the better facility? You have to work for it. They haven't got to work. They get in the streets sex life.

**Brahmānanda:**
But now they're also saying that this is good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
To have sex in the street.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
Without any rules.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are coming to that point, the hippies. Openly they are having sex life, on the street, on the beach. [break]

**Madhudviṣa:**
We may enjoy while we are here now. If we think about the future, then that means we are taking our mind off the present.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Then close all these universities, school, colleges. Close.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Well, that's also for enjoyment at present time because we can get together and have social life.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is for future, not for present. The child does not want to go to school, but the father forces him to go for future.

**Jayādvaita:**
That's tangible, though.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayādvaita:**
That's tangible. You can see. If somebody gets a university education, he understands he gets a job, this, that, but in Kṛṣṇa consciousness you can't see how he's going back to Godhead.

**Prabhupāda:**
And besides that, why you are keeping money in the bank, do good bank balance?

**Madhudviṣa:**
Because it's giving interest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That means for future.

**Madhudviṣa:**
No, I can enjoy the interest in the present.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you don't enjoy. That the future you may not be in difficulty; therefore... Why insurance? Why the insurance company?

**Trivikrama:**
Also, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness you can see the result immediately. You become more happy.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they say there is no future. Then why you are paying insurance fees? There are so many insurance company. Everyone is thinking of future, consciously or unconsciously.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
After I die, my children will carry on for me.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
After I die my children...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is also future. "Your children" means future. You enjoy. Why do you care for your children? You enjoy.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Well, it's granted that we are all thinking about the future, but isn't it possible for us to take the best of what the material world has to offer and also make the best of what the spiritual world has to offer, simultaneously?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
What is the necessity of renouncing everything? You can't be...

**Prabhupāda:**
Not renouncing. Not renouncing. Just like our think of future, that is also for present benefit. Future, future... The best intelligence is that just like one is afraid of suffering in old age, future. So there is. That is not ignorance. That is future life. So //karmīs// are thinking future life should be very comfortable. They want to go to the heavenly planets. They therefore act very piously, perform //yajñas.// That is all future. So real problem is that we are going to get another body in future. So what kind of body we shall get? That is intelligence. Body you have to get. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. So one should be very intelligent---"What kind of body I am going to get?"

**Brahmānanda:**
Why can't we have sense gratification and God also, at the same time?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is //Bhagavad-gītā,// that //aviruddho-kāmo 'smi:// "Sense gratification which is not against religious principle, that sense gratification I am," Kṛṣṇa says. We do not stop sense gratification, but we want to regulate sense gratification like a gentleman, not like hogs and dogs. That is human civilization. Sense gratification like hogs and dogs, not required. Sense gratification... People are following that. Although they are so degraded, still, they have not sanctioned as yet to have openly sense gratification on the street like hogs and dogs. That is regulated. That's still going on. But because the civilization is dragging down to animalism, they don't want this restriction. That is the hippies' protest, that "Why this convention required? Let us enjoy like hogs and dogs." That is advancement.

**Viṣṇujana:**
The scientists are helping them do that also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Viṣṇujana:**
The scientists are helping them to do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
What shall we... Why should we enjoy sense gratification like gentlemen?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Why should a person...

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you do it? That is the, already there. Why don't you have sense gratification on the street?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Well, they're already having. People are already having.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not having very freely. Not very freely.

**Brahmānanda:**
It's against the law.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, against the law.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Anyway, if I'm always worried about the future, how will anything get done now? If I'm always worried about the future, how will anything get done now?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we gave that you are not to think of future foolishly. Anyone who is going to school, it does not mean that he is not taking care of his body. The school-going is future, but still he's taking care of his body. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
...of survival of the fittest. If I have a lot of sense enjoyment, then that is God's will.

**Prabhupāda:**
But nobody is fit to survive. [laughs] That is the real problem. You are struggling for surviving, but you'll not survive. That is nature's law.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Well, they say that within this life...

**Prabhupāda:**
Better... There is. But these rascals, they do not know how to survive. If you have got death, then where is your question of surviving?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
So why not eat, drink and be merry, because tomorrow you die?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That's all right. That, animals are also doing. You can do that.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
But the animals are happy.

**Prabhupāda:**
But why do you say survival? The animals do not think of survival.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
I didn't mention survival. He did.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are free. They are never worried about survival or death. Never.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
So the animals are happy...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But you...

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
But human beings are unhappy.

**Prabhupāda:**
So therefore they are becoming generally gliding down to animal life.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
So isn't that better?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, for you. [laughter]

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
If the animals are happy and the human beings are unhappy, why not live like an animal?

**Prabhupāda:**
So yes, they are coming to that, animal life. Then why do you call human civilization?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
But if I stop all these activities, then there will be no more pleasure. If I stop all these activities...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, pleasure, you do not know what is pleasure. You rascal, you do not know what is pleasure. Just like the hog, he's also enjoying pleasure, eating stool. So your pleasure is like that. You eat stool and enjoy life. That is your standard of pleasure.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But who...? We can say that because we're above the hogs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But what do the hogs think?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hogs think like that.

**Madhudviṣa:**
They think they're enjoying.

**Prabhupāda:**
If you become hog, you will also think like that.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But let us say just from our human standpoint...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then the human standard point is... If a hog eating stool, you hate it.

**Madhudviṣa:**
We hate it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But he doesn't hate it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore... Because he is hog. You become hog, you'll not hate it.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But what if I am human being? I am enjoying this material life...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why do you hate that?

**Madhudviṣa:**
Well, I don't hate what I'm doing now, myself.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, if you are given a plate of stool, would you like to eat?

**Madhudviṣa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why? Why do you hate? Why do you hate?

**Madhudviṣa:**
But I'm not a hog now.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They eat the hog.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But I am not a hog.

**Prabhupāda:**
And therefore you hate.

**Madhudviṣa:**
I hate it because I'm not a hog.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
If I was a hog, I would like it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So become hog.

**Madhudviṣa:**
No, I don't want to become hog.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you'll have to hate.

**Madhudviṣa:**
No, I want to stay as a human being and enjoy here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then it is... Then you'll hate.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But someone else has to hate it, not the person who is actually enjoying it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is enjoying stool? Human being?

**Jayādvaita:**
They may say that "The hog... It's all right if I become a hog. So it doesn't matter if I become a hog or a dog because I may hate the hog's enjoyment while I'm a human being; when I'm a hog, I'll also like it."

**Prabhupāda:**
So do that.

**Jayādvaita:**
So it's all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
The nature will give you the chance. If you want to enjoy stool next life, it will be available. You enjoy. That is nature's law---"If you like this, come on. Take it." //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhutānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart, and if He sees that "This rascal desires like this," immediately He orders to the material nature, "Give him a body like hog. He wants to enjoy." //Brahmāyan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.// This is already stated. If you want a hog's body, immediately it is ready. You can get it---a dog's body, hog's body. Similarly, if you want devotee's body, that will be offered also to you. //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. As you desire, Kṛṣṇa is ready to give you.

**Brahmānanda:**
But if the standard is happiness, and the hog is happy and the devotee is happy, then what is the distinction?

**Prabhupāda:**
That distinction the hogs and dogs cannot make. That is for human beings.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
What happens if a human being can't distinguish...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is called //māyā,// that he cannot make any distinction. Both the same. That is //māyā. Māyā-mohitaḥ.// Just like on the street, there it is signboard: "Keep to the left." The hogs and dogs cannot do it. But human beings can do. That is the distinction between hogs and dogs and human being. Human being is supposed to make distinction. And the hogs and dogs are supposed not to make any distinction.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sign: "No dogs allowed."

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The sign "No dogs allowed" is not written for the dog.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Someone would say that that example just means that the hog doesn't speak your language.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Madhudviṣa:**
The hog doesn't speak your language, it doesn't mean that he doesn't discriminate...

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore language, civilized language, is not meant for the dogs and hogs.

**Madhudviṣa:**
No, it's just different language.

**Prabhupāda:**
No different; not different language. I mean to say that rules and regulations, books, they are not meant for hogs and dogs. Even their own language it is said, they'll not understand.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
So you say that two kinds of people enjoy life, the //paramahaṁsas// and the great fools. So what's wrong with being a great fool? They're also enjoying.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You become. That's nice. If you want to remain a great fool, there is no checking you. You can go on.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Well then what..., what is the check on fools? What is the check on fools?

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no check on fools. You can do anything.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
How do we know that the animals don't know all of these great truths?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
How do we know that the animals don't know all of these truths?

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they cannot follow. If you call the dogs and hogs, "Please come here. There will be //Gītā// lecture," they'll not come.

**Nalinī-kānta:**
We have already had a hog's body, so we didn't like it. Otherwise, why would we change?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. By the process of nature automatically evolves. That is evolution. They do not know. But nature giving him chance, this type of body, this, more intelligent, more intelligent, more intelligent... Then you come to the human form of body, very good intelligence. And if he does not utilize it, again he becomes a hogs and dogs. Go round, merry-go-round. Merry-go-round. If you don't take... You have got now. By evolution you have got this human form of body. If you do not utilize it properly, then again you become a hog. So again, for millions' years. So...

**Rūpānuga:**
They say, "We don't remember. We don't remember being a hog, so where is the harm?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Rūpānuga:**
We don't remember being a hog, so...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is hoggism, that you do not remember. Therefore you are hog. Because you do not remember, therefore you are hog. That is the distinction.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Why did God create death in order to stop our enjoyment?

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Why did God create death?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, therefore you are under the control of God. You understand it. So you cannot become free. Therefore death is there, ultimately. You are thinking you are free of the kingdom of God, or laws of God. "No, you are not free. You'll die and you'll accept another body and according to My decision." That is God. This is a question like "Why government created punishment? Why not enjoy ourself without any punishment?" It is a question like that. And that cannot be. It is not possible. That is the proof that there is God.

**Trivikrama:**
Death.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Trivikrama:**
Death is the proof that there is God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
And the other part is that then there is another body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
Death and then another body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Another body, immediately. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. That is the tangible proof that there is God. You have to die and accept another body. Just like the proof of government is that you are acting irresponsibly, you must be arrested or be punished. That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But they say it is just a proof of nature, not of God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, nature is instrumental, just like jail is instrument. But the proprietor of the jail, conductor of the jail, is government. Jail is not acting independently. By the government's direction. Similarly, the nature is working by the direction of God. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. That is stated. Nature is not independent. Just like the nature is that this lump of matter will lie down here, but if God desires, it can fly on the sky. That is God's will. Nature is not independent. Then it would have remained here. Just like Lord Rāmacandra collected stones and it was floating. According to law of gravitation, how it can float?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, they say that's just a story.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Brahmānanda:**
They say that's...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is nonsense.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The planets are floating.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is nonsense. How these planets are floating? That is also story? [laughter]

**Devotee:**
How long would the planets float if it was put in the hands of a scientist?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Devotee:**
If they were in charge of enforcing the law of floating the planets...

**Prabhupāda:**
Let them do that. See. That was done by Hiraṇyākṣa. He brought down the planet in the ocean, but Kṛṣṇa again rescued.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, and killed him.

**Prabhupāda:**
And killed him.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
So in the //Gītā// verse it says that this body is a field of enjoyment.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where it is?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Thirteenth Chapter.

**Prabhupāda:**
What does it say?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The field of activities.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he said "field of enjoyment." He said. What is this nonsense?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He was changing the //Gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] Where it is stated?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Well, Kṛṣṇa says that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Where says? Why do you speak like nonsense, "This body is for enjoyment"?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
No, field.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Kṛṣṇa says that the living entity is the enjoyer of the field and the body is the field.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another thing.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
So the living entity can enjoy his desires in that field according to his past activities.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is not enjoyment. It is worker. Just like this field is for working, and the farmer is working. That does not mean he's enjoying. He's working. This field is given for working. But this working does not mean that he's enjoying. And because this working, working on the field is not enjoyment, therefore nobody's coming. They are going to the factory. They are going to the factory. Had it been enjoyment, then they would have come. But no, they go to the factory. And they are prepared to purchase from the farmer at any cost to avoid this working. That is the difficulty at the present moment. If you are asked that "You work here," I don't think you'll agree. It is not enjoyment. Will you take a plow and do...? No. Why? If it is enjoyment, why not?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
The work is too hard.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, that's it. That's it.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
So what I meant... This body is a field.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, body is field is... The example is given. Just like this field, to work with this body is not enjoyment. Everyone is suffering with body, so many people, always suffering threefold miseries. That is not enjoyment. It is enjoyment for the fools, rascals, who are covered by the illusory energy.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
In the //Gītā// you use the term, though, "field." You use "the enjoyer of the field."

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]. One who is suffering, where is enjoyment? Every field, every body is given to the living entity because he wanted. Just like some of you want to become hog, so that field of activities, hog's body, will be given to you. Enjoy it. You want it, and Kṛṣṇa is there within your heart. He understands that you want it---"Take it." That's all. "Now enjoy. Become hog."

**Brahmānanda:**
One question, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Brahmānanda:**
If the planets, they have always been floating, but the stones of Lord Rāmacandra has put in the ocean, they are still not... Where are they?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Brahmānanda:**
The stones that Rāmacandra put, they are not still floating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Floating, that is Rāmacandra's desire.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
What happened to the stones now?

**Prabhupāda:**
That Rāmacandra knows. You go there. [break]

**Tripurāri:**
"...enjoyment comes from the fact that he's thinking he's saving the world. He's out preaching. Your enjoyment is simply subtle sense gratification."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tripurāri:**
They say that our enjoyment is subtle sense gratification. We feel we're saving the world; therefore we get some pleasure from that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. If you say sense gratification, senses are there, and senses want satisfaction, but you can know the proper way of satisfaction. That we have to teach.. We do not say that "Make your senses blunt," but you enjoy properly. That is stated, //tapo divyaṁ yena śuddhyet sattva hy asmad brahma-saukhyam anantam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. You are wanting sense gratification, but it is being checked up on account of your diseased condition of life. Therefore you purify yourself. Then you enjoy senses perpetually. This is the injunction. We are not stopping sense gratification. But you are trying to gratify senses in your diseased condition. Just like if you are feverish, you cannot enjoy to eat a //rasagullā.// It will be not tasteful. So cure yourself and enjoy //rasagullā.// That is our program.

**Rāmeśvara:**
We are sometimes accused of being very puffed up because we are..., they..., we, we think that we can have a direct relationship with God, that God will speak to us. So we are accused of being very puffed up for thinking that we can have a direct relationship with God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that is natural for the fools, because they cannot think of it, that one can talk with God. But God says, //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]: "After giving up this body, the devotees come to Me." Then where..., what you will do there? He'll talk or not talk?

**Rāmeśvara:**
There he'll talk.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Then? There is process, how to talk with God. But these rascals, they do not know. They think it is all imagination. They do not know.

**Rāmeśvara:**
But we are so insignificant. Why should God waste His time talking with us?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because you are sons. Although you are insignificant, you are God's sons. So He likes to talk with His sons. Just like a small child. Everyone knows that he cannot talk. Still, father tries to make him talking, to enjoy. Māyāpur-candrodaya Temple is teaching all these fools and rascals how to talk with God. That is our mission. [break]

**Devotee:**
...Irresponsible citizens in the state are punished by the government by being put into the prison house, and that similarly, in this human form of life, if we are irresponsible then we are punished by God by birth and death. So what about the man who is responsible for his family and executes his duty ni...

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, that is... Cats and dogs have also responsible for the family. What is credit for him?

**Devotee:**
Well, what actually is responsibility?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. The dog also allows the nipple to be sucked by the cubs. That is family maintenance. So what credit do you get by family maintenance? Why do you specially claim any benefit by maintain...? That is being done by the cats and dogs. Do you think that the animals do not take care of their children? Then if you take, then where is the difference between him and yourself? You are also the cats and dogs. Your main business is to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. If you forget that---you remain cats and dogs---then you'll become again cats and dogs. //Punar muṣiko bhava:// "Again become a mouse." The mouse was given the chance to elevate gradually to a tiger, and when he became tiger, he wanted to devour the saintly person. And he said, "All right, again you become mouse." That is also... You are given the chance of self-realization. If you do not do it, then again become cats and dogs, maintain your family.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
So if a... [break] [end]
