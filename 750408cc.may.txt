[aside conversation while verse recitation is going on]

**Devotee (1):**
Prabhupāda, you want this [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācārya-//[indistinct] means beginning from your spiritual master. Where is the picture of your spiritual master?

**Devotee (1):**
Of Your Divine Grace?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (1):**
When you're not here, that's put here.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is put here? So long I am here, you can...

**Devotee (2):**
[leads chanting of verse etc.]

"Glory to the all-merciful Rādhā and Madana-mohana! I am lame and ill-advised, yet They are my directors, and Their lotus feet are everything to me."

**Prabhupāda:**

> jayatāṁ suratau paṅgor
> mama manda-mater gatī
> mat-sarvasva-padāmbhojau
> rādhā-madana-mohanau
> [[books:cc:adi:1:15|[Cc. Ādi 1.15]]]

That is //sambandha. Sambandha, abhidheya, prayojana.// At the present moment, in our conditioned stage of life, we have forgotten our relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is our conditional life. Just like a son has forgotten his father, rich father, opulent father, and loitering in the street, that is our condition. We are all sons of Kṛṣṇa, part and parcel, and Kṛṣṇa is full of six opulences: richness, strength, influence, beauty, knowledge, renunciation---Kṛṣṇa is complete. If my father is complete, and I am his son, beloved son, why shall I loiter in the street? This is //māyā.// We are thinking that we are made of something of these material elements: "I am this body. The body is made of this material element," //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. So this is our //manda-mati. Manda// means bad. This conception, bodily conception of life, is the cause of our conditional life, subjected to the stringent laws of material nature. This is our position.

So Kṛṣṇa begins, therefore, His instruction that "Don't think you are this body. This is your covering. You are within this body." That is the beginning of Kṛṣṇa's instruction. And at last He, as a father, advises, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. So when we do that---giving up everything, we surrender to Kṛṣṇa---at that time we revive our relationship with Kṛṣṇa. This is wanted. Therefore the author is instructing us, //jayatāṁ suratau paṅgor mama. Manda// means one who cannot go very fast; or bad. //Manda// means mad; //manda// means slow. In this age especially, in Kali-yuga we become very, very slow in spiritual progress, although that is our main business. But on account of this Kali-yuga, we are all very, very slow. We think that "Spiritual cultivation is meant for old age. Now let us enjoy our life in this material world."

That is our wrong conception of life. What do you mean by old age? Nearing death. So who can guarantee that he is not nearing death? Everyone is nearing death at any moment. Why should you wait for old age? That is //manda-mati,// bad intelligence. We should know that death may take place at any moment. Therefore every one of us are already old. Old... Generally we understand that old age means nearing death, but who can guarantee that there is no death immediately? At any moment. Therefore //śāstra// says, //tūrṇaṁ yateta anu-mṛtyu pateta yāvad.// Before meeting your next death, you should endeavor so dexterously that you complete your Kṛṣṇa consciousness before your death comes. That is intelligence. Not that "I am now young man. Let me enjoy. And in old age, after passing sixty years, when there will be no other engagement, at that time I shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//" No. Immediately, //tūrṇaṁ yate.//

Prahlāda Mahārāja advises,

> kaumāra ācaret prājño
> dharmān bhāgavatān iha
> durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma
> tad apy adhruvam arthadam
> [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]

He advises from childhood. Just like we are trying to teach even the small boy, a small child, to chant and dance with us, and they are learning. It is not difficult. The small children, they are also taking part. Now somebody may say that "These children do not understand English. What they are hearing? Simply they are wasting their time." No, they are not wasting their time. The vibration is surcharged with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So even they simply hear, even though do not understand English language, by simply hearing the vibration uttered by a Vaiṣṇava to a Vaiṣṇava, that will be effective. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. Simply hearing will do. Simply by hearing they will become pious. And the chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// somehow or other, if one takes part in these discourses, he will be pious. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ. Paraṁ vijāyate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam. Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. Simply by hearing it is effective, always. So from the very beginning of our life, we should try to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Not try, but we must. It is not, what is called, optional. It is compulsory. It is compulsory. If you want to make your life successful, then this is compulsory, from the very beginning to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

So especially in India, the atmosphere is very good. It is especially meant, within this universe, this plot of land known as Bhārata-varṣa, India, is the most sacred place within this universe. And of the whole land Bhārata-varṣa, in Bengal, it is very sacred. And the whole of Bengal, this Nadia district is very sacred. And in the whole Nadia district, this spot is very sacred, Māyāpur-candrodaya Temple. So by Kṛṣṇa's grace, you have got this opportunity to live here. Take advantage, full advantage of this opportunity, spiritually fortunate. This is the statement of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Not that I am manufacturing. We cannot manufacture anything, but we can repeat the words of our predecessors. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, in his //Jaiva-Dharma,// or in //Caitanya-śikṣāmṛta,// he has stated like that. In the Bhārata-varṣa, Bengal is the most important place, and in Bengal, the district Nadia is most important place, because Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared. Don't take it leniently. It is very serious thing that Bhārata-varṣa is meant for cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unfortunately, our present leaders, they are misleading them. Anyway, you are fortunate. You take advantage of this cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness which was spoken by Kṛṣṇa Himself, in this land of Bhārata-varṣa, //dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]].

That //kurukṣetre// is still existing. It is not a myth or mythology. The nonsense people, they may say like that, but Kṛṣṇa is the supermost person both in history... //Purāṇa// means history, //itihāsa purāṇa. Saraṁ saraṁ samuddhṛtam// [[books:sb:1:3:41|[SB 1.3.41]]]. Vyāsadeva compiled the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// by collecting the most important news from history. //Purāṇa. Purāṇa// means old history. It is not mythology. The foolish people, they say like that: "Mythology means something created." No. Don't take it that way. It is the essence of important historical incidences. Record. Both //itihāsa,// history... //Mahābhārata// is also history. //Mahā// means great, and //bhārata// means this land. Actually it is a history. But foolish people, without understanding through the //guru-paramparā// system, they manufacture their own way of understanding; therefore they are misled. They cannot take full advantage of this Vedic literature because they are misled. We should not be misled. Here, we should know always that we are lame, //paṅgoḥ.// Just like a lame man cannot go very fast. But by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, even a lame man can go fast---not only go fast, but cross over the mountain.

> mūkaṁ karoti vācālaṁ
> paṅguṁ laṅghayate girim
> yat kṛpā tam ahaṁ vande
> śrī guruṁ dīna-tāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:80|[Cc. Madhya 17.80]]]

It is possible if we become obedient student of //guru,// then even though we may be dumb, deaf and dumb, still, we can become good lecturer. //Mūkaṁ karoti vācālam,// talk very much about Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa's grace, //mūkaṁ karoti... Paṅguṁ laṅghayate girim:// if one is lame man, he is made to cross over the hill, mountain. This is the mercy of //guru.//

So //bhakti,// or cultivation of spiritual knowledge, is never checked by any material things. //Ahaituky apratihatā// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. No material thing can check us in our progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is not possible. Never think like that. Simply follow the instruction of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Follow the rules and regulation, and everything will be clear, very crystal clear. There will be no impediment. Always chant, hear; don't waste time. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, he is a moral instructor. He says about wasting time, he says, //āyuṣaḥ kṣaṇa eko 'pi na labhya svarṇa-koṭibhiḥ:// "Even one moment of your life cannot be returned, even if you are prepared to pay millions of dollars." It is so valuable, time, one moment passed. Seven... What is this month? May? No.

**Devotees:**
April.

**Prabhupāda:**
April. Now seven of April, 1975, passed. If you ask back, the return seventh April 1975, it is not possible even if you are prepared to pay millions of dollars. So just imagine what is the value of our time. So this time should not be wasted. We should always remain... You Western people, you know the value of time from material point of view. Material point of view, that is also good. Don't waste your time; engage always yourself in some good activities. But for spiritual advancement also, we should be more accurate and strict, //avyartha-kālatvam// [[books:cc:madhya:23:18-19|[Cc. Madhya 23.18-19]]].

Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has recommended that one who is always anxious to see that not a moment is spoiled, that is advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //avyartha-kālatvaṁ nāma-gāne sadā ruciḥ, vivikta deva deśa sevitam,// like that. //Upadeśāmṛta,// you will find. A devotee should always think, "Whether my time is passed uselessly?" Then he will make advancement. Don't be slow. We should be always very expertly alert not a single moment is wasted. //Jayatāṁ suratau paṅgor mama manda-mater gatī. Manda-mater gatī.// We are very slow, especially in the spiritual matter. Practically there is no intention all over the world. They do not know that is the real business is spiritual advancement of life. They are so in darkness. Very unfortunate time, this Kali-yuga. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. Now if they want to utilize, they manufacture some new ways of spiritual advancement. This is another difficulty. So many rascals, //yogīs, svāmīs,// Transcendental Meditation, this, that, //avatāras,// always ready to mislead you. Always ready. If one is little inclined that "Let me do something spiritually, advance," these rascal will mislead you. Very difficult position. Therefore, the best thing is to surrender to Madana-mohana, Kṛṣṇa. //Sambandha-devata//[?].

Madana-mohana... Our most difficult position is sex. Kṛṣṇa... //Māyā// has given such a---they may call nice or bad---such propensity, sex, that it will create disturbances. Even though you are rigid, avowed, you are doing nicely, at sometimes, especially at night, it will disturb. It will disturb. Therefore //suratau.// Kṛṣṇa is the most expert in this conjugal love, Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we have to submit, surrender to Kṛṣṇa. //Suratau paṅgoḥ.// We are very much feeble and very slow. And so far our sex impulse is concerned, here especially mentioned, Madana-mohana. Sex impulse is called Cupid, Madana. But if we become staunch devotee of Kṛṣṇa, this material sex impulse will vanish. Will vanish. Because Cupid becomes, I mean to say, attracted. Even Cupid becomes attracted by Kṛṣṇa. We are attracted by Cupid, but Cupid is attracted by Kṛṣṇa. Therefore His name is Madana-mohana. That is the only remedy.

> yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravinde
> nava-nava-rasa-dhāmany udyataṁ rantum āsīt
> tad-avadhi bata nāri-saṅgame smaryamāne
> bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca

If you stick to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa---"Kṛṣṇa save me"---then this disturbing material thing, sex agitation, will not disturb you. This is the only way. Therefore it is said Madana-mohana. Our spiritual life is hampered very strongly by this sex impulse. But it is material. The sex impulse is material, so we should try to tolerate: //kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkhaṁ kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁ viṣaheta-dhīraḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Just to tolerate little and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, pray to Kṛṣṇa, "Please save me from these disturbances." And we should materially also control. Control means //atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ// [NoI 2]. //Atyāhāraḥ,// too much eating, that is also agitating.

So everything can be controlled by Kṛṣṇa's grace. He is Madana-mohana. Therefore, our first business is to surrender to Madana-mohana and establish our relationship with Him. "My Lord Kṛṣṇa, I have so long forgotten..." That song is sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura,

> mānasa, deha, geha, yo kichu mora
> arpiluṅ tuyā pade nanda-kiśora!
> [Śaraṇāgati]

This full surrender. Then Kṛṣṇa assures, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], He will protect. So //tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]. There are so many disturbances. So Kṛṣṇa says tolerate, and do your business faithfully. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, follow the rules and regulations, and remain fully surrendered at the lotus feet of Madana-mohana. There will be no more disturbance.

Thank you very much.
