[bad recording]

**Prabhupāda:**
"...think that I am going to die very soon." You know that Romaharṣaṇa?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Romaharṣaṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Romaharṣaṇa?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Who Balarāma killed?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, another. Lomarṣa, Lomarṣa Muni. He would die when all the hairs on the body will fall down. And each hair will fall down after the death of one Brahmā. So he was chanting on the sea, and Nārada Muni was passing: "Why don't you make a cottage?" "How long I shall live? What is the use of cottage?" He's also thinking, "I'll die."

**Satsvarūpa:**
There's also the story of that Mahārāja Khāṭvaṅga, who found out that he only had a minute to live. What did he do, that he...? You say that he surrendered at once.

**Prabhupāda:**
He surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Hmm. [aside:] You can come this... Go this way. [temple //kīrtana// in background]

**Devotee:**
Prabhupāda, if we..., if we increase our devotional activities, then we automatically become satisfied, and then detached from material life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. [//kīrtana//] [end]
