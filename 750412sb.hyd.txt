**Prabhupāda:**

So the first proposal was that this human form of life is not to be wasted like cats and dogs. This is the first proposal by Ṛṣabha. He was advising His sons, "My dear boys, don't waste your this valuable life like cats and dogs and hogs." This was the first proposal. Actually, without Kṛṣṇa consciousness our life is no better than the dogs' and hogs'. That's a fact. That is the beginning of this instruction, //nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujaṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. The dogs and hogs, they will toil whole day and night for eating purposes and sense gratification. Why the human society should be like that? So these things can be learned by //mahat-sevā.// Therefore this Vedic civilization is that first of all send the children for //mahat-sevā, brahmacārī. Mahat-sevā,// that is the essential part of human life. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham// [MU 1.2.12]. To make this human life successful, to understand the value of life, to understand what I am, one must approach..., go to //gurukula. Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet.// This //abhigacchet,// this form of verb is used when it is called //vidhi-liṅ,// must! There is no option. I may go or I may not go. No. One must. That is human life. That is the instruction of Vedic //śāstra.//

In Prahlāda Mahārāja's teaching also... At childhood he was five-years-old boy, and he was teaching to his class friend, "My dear friend, that //kaumāra ācaret prajño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]." He was teaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness as soon as he was getting little opportunity. In the tiffin hour, when the teachers are gone, he would immediately stand up and preach to his friends, "My dear friend, begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness from this point. Although you are very small boys, still we have to begin here," //kaumāra ācaret prajño dharmān bhāgavatān iha.// "Why so quickly? Let us become old and feeble, when I'll not be able to do anything. Then I'll chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." "No." He says no immediately. //Kaumāra ācaret prajño dharmān bhāgavatān, durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma.// "You do not know when you shall die. So before the next death comes, complete your Kṛṣṇa consciousness." This is the business. //Kaumāra ācaret prajño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]].

Where is that education now? This is misleading civilization. They do not know the value of life. They are simply wasting time for sense gratification, that's all. No. This is not. The //Bhāgavata-dharma// means children should be taught from the very beginning of life. That is Vedic civilization. The children should go... Even Kṛṣṇa, although He's God, He was also sent to //gurukula,// and He was collecting dry wood from the forest for //guru,// learning how to serve //guru.// That //guru// must be also bona fide. Therefore it is recommended, //mahat-sevā. Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:2|[SB 5.5.2]]]. That is the Vedic civilization. One must approach a //mahānta. Moho-anta.// This whole world is illusion, and one who is above this illusion is called //mahānta,// one who has ended the illusion. //Samit-pāniḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham// [MU 1.2.12], one should approach a //guru// who is //brahma-niṣṭham. Brahma-niṣṭham// means fully fixed up in Brahman understanding. Because life is meant for //brahma-jijñāsā. Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// This life, this human form of life, is meant for inquiring about Brahman, not for anything else. Anything else---"Where is food?" "Where is shelter?" "Where is sex?" and "Where is defense?"---this is animal life. Above this, when we are in human life, our main business is //brahma-jijñāsā.// Not that "Where is food?" "Where is shelter?" "Where is sex?" and "Where is defense?" This is animal propensities, animal inquiries.

So I'm repeatedly saying the same thing---that Indian civilization is different from others. We should stick to our own culture. That is the prerogative that I am repeatedly speaking, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's message:

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

Anyone who has taken birth in this holy land of Bhārata-varṣa, he has got special advantage. He has got special advantage in this, that he can learn all this Vedic literature, //mahat-sevā.// Then he makes his life perfect. He understands what is his life, what is the value of this life, why he's suffering, how to mitigate it. This is, these things are required, and when one is well versed and practiced by example, then let him preach all over the world, //para-upakāra.// Because they do not know it. Actually that is happening. By one man's endeavor all these foreigners, they're getting real life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They have sacrificed everything practically. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is required. That is human life. Otherwise, if we simply work very hard just like the stool-eater hogs, "Where is food? Where is food? Where is sex? Where is..." This is... Therefore this particular name has been mentioned here, //viḍ-bhujām. Viḍ-bhujām.// It is very peculiar.

//Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. This is the business of the stool-eater hogs. //Śāstra// sometimes uses very strong language. That is required. Just like if you want to train your children, sometimes you have to slap, you have to chastise for his benefit. That is the... Therefore this very word is used, //viḍ-bhujāṁ ye.// These kind of engagements are there among the hogs and dogs. Are you hogs and dogs or human being? Your engagement is //brahma-jijñāsā, athāto brahma jijñāsā:// inquire about Brahman. Learn about Brahman. Learn about yourself, that you are not this material body. If you are still thinking that you are this material body---you are Indian, you are American, you are //brāhmaṇa,// you are //śūdra,// you are white, you are black---then you are in the dog's consciousness, not Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is to be learned.

So long we are in the bodily concept... That is going on all over the world. If we say, people may not be happy... Now India, in your city it is going on, Andhra conference. How long you shall remain Andhra? You may remain Andhra for say twenty years or fifty years, utmost hundred years. Then what you are going? Andhra or something else? Where is the account for that? Because Kṛṣṇa says, the Supreme authority, //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. So if you perpetually remain as Andhra, that is very good. But that is not allowed, sir. You'll be kicked out of your, this Andhra concept of life by nature's law. //Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]], Kṛṣṇa says. "When death will come, 'O my dear death, you cannot touch me. I am Andhra,' 'I am Indian,' 'I am American.' " No. "No, sir. Get out!" So where is that knowledge? //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma-ijya-dhīḥ, sa eva go-kharaḥ// [SB 10.84.13]. This kind of civilization is the civilization of the cows and asses, //go-kharaḥ. Go// means cow, and //kharaḥ// means ass. So we must understand what we are. Kṛṣṇa... Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught this. He said, "I am not //brāhmaṇa.// I am not //kṣatriya.// I am not //vaiśya.// I am not //śūdra.// I am not //brahmacārī.// I am not //sannyāsī.//" "Not, not," //neti, neti.// "Then what You are?" //Gopī-bhartuḥ pāda-kamalayor dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. This is self-realization. When we shall deny all this designation and we shall realize that I'm part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, that is self-realization. And so long we identify with this body and mind and do not know what I am, that is //go-kharaḥ// civilization, cows and asses civilization.

So especially in India we should be very careful not to follow the //go-kharaḥ// civilization. We must follow real civilization, Brahman civilization. This is the land of //brahma-jñāna.// This is the land of //brāhmaṇas, brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.// We are losing that. Be careful. It is that we offer our respect to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, that,

> namo brahmanya-devāya
> go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca
> jagad-hitāya kṛṣṇāya
> govindāya namo namaḥ

God's first business is //go-brāhmaṇa hitāya ca, brahmanya devāya.// Kṛṣṇa is very, very eager to maintain the brahminical culture in the human society, //brahma jānāti,// understanding of Brahman and //go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca, go,// cows, cow protection. Where is that civilization? Where is that brahminical culture? Where is that //go-rakṣa?// Very precarious condition. Therefore we should accept the standard of civilization. This is recommended here, //mahat-sevāṁ dvāram ahur vimukteḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:2|[SB 5.5.2]]]. If you want to become disentangled, or free from this entanglement, conditioned soul, one after another... We are forced. Our [indistinct] was saying about the change of body. The change of body is forced. You are young man. You cannot say, "I'll not accept old man's body." "No, sir. You have to accept." Forced. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. You cannot say, "I will not accept this." Kṛṣṇa says, //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. As you are forced to accept this body, old-age body---nobody wants to become old---similarly another body, //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.// These things are there. We are being forced by the laws of nature. Where is our independence? They're declaring resolution: "Now we are independent. Ah. Finished." Where is your independence? You are kicked out by the laws of nature. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. You are not free. You are under supreme control. Nature, they will accept nature's control, but not God's control. But the foolish person does not know that nature is also controlled by God. This you will have to learn from Vedic literature.

Nature is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā: sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā// [Bs. 5.44]. Goddess Durga is accepted as the material energy, or material //prakṛti.// So she's so powerful. //Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā, icchanurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā// [Bs. 5.44]. //Sā-//Durga is not independent. //Icchānurūpam api yasya,// under who's direction she is working? //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// "I am worshiping that Govinda, the //ādi-puruṣa,// the Supreme Person, //ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam nava-yauvanaṁ ca// [Bs. 5.33]." These are the information we get from the //śāstra. Ādyam,// He is the original person. //Ādyaṁ purāṇa puruṣam,// the oldest person. //Nava-yauvanaṁ ca,// and at the same time always fresh youth.

So how we shall learn all these things? //Mahat-sevā.// Go to //mahat, mahānta,// the //guru.// Serve him. //Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā// [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]. You cannot challenge like a nonsense. You have to engage yourself to the service. That is the beginning. //Brahmacārī// is indicated, "Go to //gurukula.//" And you may be a king's son or a very learned //brāhmaṇa's// son, it doesn't matter. You serve your //guru// just like a menial servant. This is the instruction. This is the first education. Go to //gurukula// and serve the //mahat guru,// the broad-minded //guru,// just like a menial servant. What is that? Now you go collect everything for //guru,// alms, and do not claim proprietorship. It is //guru's// property. Whatever you collect, that is not your property. That is //guru's// property. And go to //gurukula,// and when //guru// will ask you, "My dear boy, please come and take your //prasādam,//" then you will take. If //guru// forgets to call you, you should fast. This is //gurukula.// Not that "I am hungry. There is foodstuff. Let me eat." No. Without permission of //guru// you cannot touch anything. This is the injunction.

Now how... Strenuous training was there to live in //gurukula// and sacrifice the whole life for //guru's// instruction. This is Vedic culture, //brahmacārī,// and live at the place of //guru// just like a menial servant. Where is that education? Why you'll not expect these upstarts, Naxalites? Where is that training? Of course, it is very difficult to bring back that mode of civilization at the present moment. //Kalau naṣṭa-dṛśām:// we have lost everything by the influence of this Kali-yuga. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has advised that you //harer nāma, harer nāma, harer nāma eva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]], chant the name of Hari. //Harer nāma,// thrice He's stressing. //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalaṁ kalau,// in this age of Kali, //nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.// This is simple method. Chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, //harer nāma.// Not other's name. //Harer nāma.// There people also diverting their attention, "Any name will do." No. Not any name. //Harer nāma. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. You have to hear and chant about Kṛṣṇa, not any other demigod. No. It is particularly mentioned, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam.// This is wanted. Very simple thing. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu has... It is from the //śāstra, Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa, Agni-Purāṇa.// A saintly person, //mahānta,// will not speak anything which is not mentioned in the //śāstra.// If somebody manufactures, he's a devil. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhāgavata, yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na siddhiṁ sa avāpnoti// [[books:bg:16:23|[Bg. 16.23]]]. Anyone who goes against the //śāstra// and manufactures his own concoction, for him there is no //siddhi: na siddhiṁ sa avāpnoti. Na sukham,// neither any happiness. And what to speak of //parāṁ gatim?//

So we should give up all these things. The all, the essence of all //śāstra// is //Bhagavad-gītā.// All the [indistinct Sanskrit], //Garbha Upaniṣad.// All the //Upaniṣad,// Vedic //śāstra,// is spoken in a very short, cream[?], //Bhagavad-gītā,// and the Supreme Personality speaking Himself. So we should take it very seriously. Unfortunately, although //Bhagavad-gītā// is spoken in India, and there are many so-called students of //Bhagavad-gītā,// but they're interpreting in their own way, misleading people. Don't be misled in that way. Take //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is; then it will automatically act. The medicine, as directed by the physician, you should take. You should not manufacture your own way of doses. Suppose physician says that "You take five drops of this medicine, mix with water and take it." You have to follow that. If you say, "No, let me be cured immediately. Let me take hundred drops" or "one drop." No. That will not help you. Similarly, you should read //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is prescribed by the physician, Kṛṣṇa. Then you will benefit.

That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa says personally that //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. This //yoga// system is //avyaya,// eternal. Kṛṣṇa is eternal, and Kṛṣṇa's words are eternal, and you are also eternal. This is our position. Kṛṣṇa is eternal, and we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we are eternal. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]], Kṛṣṇa says. //Na jāyate na mriyate va kadācit:// you are never born, never die. Kṛṣṇa also, //nityo nityānām.// We are all //nityas,// eternal, but He's the supreme //nitya, nityo nityānām.// We are plural //nitya;// He is singular //nitya.// So what is the difference between this plural and singular? The singular maintains all these plural, //eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. He is the maintainer and we are maintained.

So everything is mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// and that is the essence of all Vedic literature. Our propaganda is that you read //Bhagavad-gītā,// try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, without any foolish commentary. As soon as you comment, that is foolishness. Don't do it. Read as it is. Then you'll get the enlightenment and you'll understand Kṛṣṇa, because Kṛṣṇa is teaching to make you understand what is God, what is Kṛṣṇa. Why should we deviate? Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "Learn //Bhagavad-gītā,// the same instruction, //mahat-sevā.//" //Sevā.// Kṛṣṇa says, //tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā// [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]. Unless you are prepared to render service to your spiritual master... First of all you must find out the proper spiritual master. Then you must engage yourself to his service. Then you can question. Otherwise don't waste your time and your spiritual master's time. //Tad viddhi,// you must know.

The first thing is //praṇipātena, praṇipātena, prakṛṣṭa rūpeṇa nipāt,// fully surrendered. Just like these boys, they have learned. They will see their spiritual master hundred time, and hundred times they'll fall flat and offer respect. This is called //praṇipāta.// Hundred times. Not that I finished my //praṇipāta// in the morning as an etiquette now. No. These boys are so good. They have learned that they'll meet me hundred times and they'll fall flat hundred times. This is called //praṇipāta.// This is the injunction. //Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā// [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]. That is the Vedic injunction.

> yasya deve parā bhaktir
> yathā deve tathā gurau
> tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ
> prakāśante mahātmanaḥ
> [ŚU 6.23]

This... The meaning of the Vedic literature is revealed. It is not by your mundane scholarship you can understand. That is not possible. //Tasya ete kathitā arthāḥ prakāśante.// It becomes revealed. To whom? //Yasya deve parā bhaktir:// one who has unflinching faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Yathā deve tathā gurau,// similar faith in //guru.// For them the meaning of this Vedic literature becomes revealed. It is not by mundane scholarship: "I think it is like that." Who are you? You are thinking like that? No. That is not the process. //Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā.// Two things must be there. First of all //praṇipāta,// and the other side, //sevā,// and the middle, //paripraśna.//

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

Who is //jñānī?// Who has seen the truth. Not that supposing, "I supposedly like this." No. Whether you have seen. That is required.

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

Arjuna also made like that. In the beginning Arjuna was talking with Kṛṣṇa on equal level like friends, but later on he said, //śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam// [[books:bg:2:7|[Bg. 2.7]]]. //Prapannam,// this //praṇipāta,// "I am surrendering to You."

So find out //guru.// Who is //guru? Guru// means who's coming from the //paramparā// system. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, //evaṁ paramparā prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. //Rajarṣaya:// big, big, learned saintly kings. That means government. Now we are taking, accepting king by democracy, anyone by votes. No. //Rājarṣaya.// One must be governor, he must be as good as a //ṛṣi,// saintly person. //Rājarṣaya.// They must understand the purport of //Bhagavad-gītā,// the aim of life. Then they will educate, the governor will educate the citizens how to make life successful. But if he does not understand what is the success of life, how he will govern? But it is going on. But //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ.// The //Bhagavad-gītā// is meant for the //rājarṣis,// saintly kings, saintly governor. Because he has to govern, he must know how to govern: what is the aim of life, how they can be elevated.

Just like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, because he was a good governor, good king, so during his time it is said that //kāmaṁ parjanya vavarṣa.// There is word I am just forgetting, that all the necessities of life were supplied through rain. //Kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ sarva-kāma-dugha-mahī// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]: that we derive all necessities of life through the earth. //Sarva-kāma-dugha-mahī.// So if the king is pious, then the earth will give you production enough for your satisfaction. Now I've seen in your country so much land is lying vacant. Why it is not being produced? Because you do not know how to derive all benefits from earth. That you do not know. Therefore people are in scarcity. There is no question of scarcity. Kṛṣṇa has given everything. //Pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇāt pūrṇam...// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśopaniṣad, Invocation]]]. There cannot be anything imperfect which is created by God. Everything is perfect. But if we become godless, the supply will be crippled. That is the secret we do not know. These things we have to learn from //śāstra.// As soon as people will become demonic, nature will restrict supply: "Now you become demonic. That's all right."

So this is going on. Therefore it is recommended, //mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimuktes,// if you want to become free from all anxieties. First of all this material world means anxiety. We are put... We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Why we are sent to this material world? //Icchā-dveṣa sammutthena, sarge yānti parantapa// [[books:bg:7:27|[Bg. 7.27]]], because we wanted to enjoy life independent of God, or Kṛṣṇa. This is the disease. We are not independent. If there is no rain and there is no food grains, what your independence will do? No. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]], very practical, that if you want to be happy, either animal or man, //bhūtāni,// then you produce //anna,// food grains, sumptuously. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.// And there must be sufficient rain for producing sufficient food grains. //Yajñād bhavanti parjanyaḥ,// and you perform //yajña,// there will be regular rainfall. //Yajñaḥ-karma samudbhavam.// Who is following this principle? //Yajñaḥ-karma samudbhavam.// Kṛṣṇa never says that factories, by factories //bhavanti bhūtāni. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni,// He says this is practical. We are not interested how to produce //anna.// We are now interested how to produce tire tubes. So eat tire tube.

So this is going on. Take Kṛṣṇa's instruction as it is, you'll be happy. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is not a bogus thing; it is very scientific, authorized. Take it very seriously, especially those who are born Indians. They've got the advantage. Don't be misled.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So, any questions?

**Acyutānanda:**
If there are any questions, kindly print them on a piece of paper very clearly... [indistinct] and put any questions this time. Print very clearly. [pause] [reading question] "Is there any result to chanting Kṛṣṇa's name mechanically, or must it be uttered with complete devotion? If it is the later, how is Ajāmila..., and how did he get //mokṣa?//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The chanting of Kṛṣṇa's name is exactly, immediately associating with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is absolute. Kṛṣṇa... //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. //Nāmādi// means name, then form, then quality, then entourage, so many things. Kṛṣṇa is not alone. So they're all absolute. Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's name is not different. Identical. So when we chant Kṛṣṇa's name it means that we are directly associating with Kṛṣṇa. This is a fact. So as you, if you become nearer to or touch fire, then you will get the resultant action. So if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// that means immediately you are in touch with Kṛṣṇa. And the result will begin immediately.

That is explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. By chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// you will cleanse your dirty heart, because that is the beginning of our suffering: misunderstanding. So there are other references in the //śāstra.// Just like:

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇa
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi

Kṛṣṇa is sitting within your heart, //īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Kṛṣṇa is with you, but you do not know. But as soon as you try to chant and hear, hear Kṛṣṇa's name, then immediately the cleansing of your heart begins, //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.// Then //bhava mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpanam,// as soon as your heart is cleansed... Heart is cleansed means you understand that you are not this material body. That is cleansing of heart. Everything is going on on this misunderstanding that "I am this body"---"I am Indian," "I am American," "I am this," "I am that." This is the grossest type of misunderstanding. So that becomes clear. Then you stand on your own position, //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. There are so many things we'll gradually follow. Therefore if we chant Kṛṣṇa's name without any offense... There are ten kinds of offenses, but in the beginning, even there is offense, you go on chanting and gradually, as your heart will be cleansed... That is explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpanaṁ
> śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam
> ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtāsvādanaṁ
> paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam
> [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]

So if you follow the instruction and if we chant, even though we do not understand in the beginning what is the effect of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// but it will show its effect if you go on chanting. Just like I began this movement in America. I did not ask them anything; I simply invited them, "Please come and chant with me." And just see the result. It is practical. I never bribed them, nor I showed any magic. I simply asked them, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." And see the result. It is practical.

**Acyutānanda:**
Another question: "Why is //oṁ// not figured in your [indistinct]? All should come to the banner of //oṁ// instead of praying to so many gods. By doing so there would be unity throughout the land."

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa says, //praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu:// "I am the //oṁkāra// in all Vedic //mantras.//" //Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti. Oṁkāra// is as good. That is also Kṛṣṇa. So either you chant //oṁkāra// or Kṛṣṇa, there is no difference. But in the //śāstras// it is recommended that you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, not //oṁkāra.// So you have to accept //śāstra.// And Caitanya Mahāprabhu practically demonstrated. He was chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇa-varṇam, kṛṣṇaṁ varṇayati,// Hare Kṛṣṇa. So we have to follow the //śāstra// and the great saintly person. Otherwise there is no difference between //oṁkāra// and Kṛṣṇa. But because //śāstra// recommends //harer nāma harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]], we have to accept it.

**Mahāṁsa:**
There is a question here: "Please give brief resume of Swami A. C. Bhaktivedanta's life." I would just like to make a note that we have printed our recent //Hare Kṛṣṇa Explosion// fortnightly. It is available at the stall, bookstall near here. This issue has been dedicated to His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Śrīla Prabhupāda, how he started this International Society for Krishna Consciousness and other achievements, books of Śrīla Prabhupāda. So if you would like to know, you can take one of these issues.

**Acyutānanda:**
Any question? [reading] "According to your observation, godlessness is responsible for scarcity. Then what about Communist countries compared with India?"

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Viṣṇujana:**
"If godlessness is the cause of scarcity, why the Communist countries are so affluent?"

**Prabhupāda:**
They are asking food from America. [laughter]

**Acyutānanda:**
"Why is Kṛṣṇa consciousness not spread in China, Russia, Pakistan and Bangladesh?" [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
You come forward. I shall train you.

**Acyutānanda:**
"Does Śrīla Prabhupāda agree with the work of Ramakrishna Mission, Maharishi, meditation, and Divine Light Mission now working in America?"

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Do you agree with the work of the Ramakrishna Mission, Mahesh Yogi, and Divine Light Society that are working in America?

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not study them. I simply study //Bhagavad-gītā,// that's all. And Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. I believe that. That's all.

**Acyutānanda:**
"What is meant by absolute surrender? How are we to satisfy ourselves, having done so?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Absolute surrender means //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. I am surrendering to Kṛṣṇa to get this benefit---that is conditional surrender. I surrender to Kṛṣṇa without any motive---that is absolute.

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

No motive. That is required. If I think that I shall get some benefit---that is business; that is not //bhakti.// That is taught by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

> āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu māṁ
> marma-hatāṁ karoty vā adarśanān
> yathā tathā vā vidadhātu lampaṭo
> mat-prāṇa-nāthas tu sa eva nāparaḥ
> [[books:cc:antya:20:47|[Cc. Antya 20.47]]]

"You can treat me like anything. You can make me brokenhearted by Your absence. Still You are my Lord." That is unconditional surrender.

**Acyutānanda:**
"When I visited the Hare Kṛṣṇa center I thought that God had no form. In such case why should we garnish the idol of Kṛṣṇa with jewelry and adore the idol?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? What is that?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Why should we adore the idol if God has no form?

**Prabhupāda:**
Who says God has no form? God is the supreme father. You know your father has form. What the supreme father has done that He'll not have form? Your father has got form. You're born of him. Then why the supreme father will not have form? What fault He has done? What is this logic? God is supposed to..., the supreme father. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. That is the Vedic information. The Supreme is that which is the source of everything. So we have got varieties of forms, and why the source should be formless? Why? What is the logic? We have got so many forms---8,400,000---and Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]: "Of all these forms of life, I am the seed-giving father." The seed-giving father, Kṛṣṇa, has form, and His sons have got form. Why the father should be formless? What is this logic? Eh? What is this logic---can anyone say?---that because He's father, therefore He should be formless. What is this logic? The father must have form. Otherwise how many form... All these forms, wherefrom it is coming? Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ bīja pradaḥ pitā.// He is the father. If the sons have form, why the father will not have form? What is this logic?

This is not logical conclusion. The real idea is... Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that "My dear Arjuna, you, Me and all these kings and soldiers who have assembled here, they were in the past like this," that means they had forms, "and they're existing like this. And they'll continue to exist." Where is formless? You see, refer to //Bhagavad-gītā.// He says in the past all of them existed like this, and we're existing now like this, past, present, and in the future they'll continue. So where is formlessness? There is no question of formlessness. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. When there is such question, formlessness means that is not material form. But there is form. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Vigraha// means form. But that is //sat-cid-ānanda:// eternal, full of bliss and full of knowledge. This is not this form. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritaḥ, paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]: "These rascals, they do not know what I am. Therefore he's thinking that My form and his form is the same." //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā.// Unless one is //mūḍha,// he cannot say that God is formless. God has form. But His form is different from our form, this material form. //Sat-cit-ānanda-vigraha.// So therefore we have to learn all these things by //mahat-sevā dvāraṁ vimukteḥ.// We can get out of all this ignorance when we are engaged in //mahat-sevā.// Otherwise, we shall remain in the darkness. Kṛṣṇa has form, but His form is different from our this material form. That is to be understood.

**Acyutānanda:**
"Is showing miracles to the people by some //svāmīs// the way to bring them back to spiritual life or not?"

**Viṣṇujana:**
Is showing miracles like some //svāmīs// do the way to bring people back to spiritual life?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why should I show miracles? What is the business? I have to speak the truth, that's all. What is the use of miracle? When you go to college or school, we want to see miracles, or you learn books and knowledge? Kṛṣṇa never said that you go to a //guru// who can perform miracles. He never said that. He said,

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

Go to a //jñānī,// and who has known the truth, not to a jugglers, magician. Science is not magic. Science is knowledge. That is the Vedic injunction. //Tad vijñānārtham:// in order to understand that science, not to see jugglery and magic. The jugglery and magic is here present: all these meat-eaters, drunkards, woman-hunters, now Vaiṣṇava. This is real magic. If you have got eyes to see, see the magic. If you are blind, then that is different question. This is magic.

**Acyutānanda:**
Question: "I believe in Kṛṣṇa, but please clarify the following doubts. Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so when Kṛṣṇa is the only God in the world, the creator of the whole universe, then why the existence of Jesus Christ and Allah? Why should not only one God for all? Why Christians and Muslims are not accepting the Kṛṣṇa conscious..., Kṛṣṇa as God?"

**Prabhupāda:**
They are accepting God, but they did not disclose the name of God, because the people are unable to understand. //Kṛṣṇa// means "the all-attractive." That is the meaning of //Kṛṣṇa.// So unless God is all-attractive, how He can be God? //Kṛṣṇa// means all-attractive.

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]

When one understands Kṛṣṇa... To understand Kṛṣṇa, it takes little time. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye, yatatām api siddhānām// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. So Kṛṣṇa revealed Himself in India before Arjuna, and what the others will understand about Kṛṣṇa unless he's advanced like Arjuna? So there are different persons, so different types of religion they have revealed. That is also Kṛṣṇa---but to some extent. The full extent they cannot understand. Just like Lord Jesus Christ says, "Thou shall not kill." Just imagine what the audience were. They are killers, so what they will understand about Kṛṣṇa? Let them first stop this killing. Then the stage will come he'll understand what is Kṛṣṇa.

> yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

One who is sinful, the first instruction should be, "You stop your sinful activities." Then the opportunity will come to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is stated in the... //Yeṣāṁ tu anta-gataṁ pāpam.// One who is sinful, what he will understand about Kṛṣṇa? First of all, stop sinful activities. Then this stage will come, he'll understand Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Jesus Christ said, "You nonsense, stop killing." Then there will be time we'll understand one day Kṛṣṇa. So the first instruction is to stop sinful activities; then he'll be qualified.

> yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

So everything by step by step, not by jump. That is not possible.

**Acyutānanda:**
"It is said, //mānava-sevā// is //mādhava-sevā.// Then why doesn't your mission serve man as in the incarnation of Lord Kṛṣṇa instead of chanting the name?"

**Viṣṇujana:**
Why don't we serve man instead of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
We are not going to follow //your// instruction. We have to follow the instruction of the //śāstra.// You cannot say that "Why you are..." Are we not serving the man? We are trying to give you the knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. Is it not serving the man? The better service---to give knowledge. If a man is hungry, he can give some food. That will give him some temporary benefit. But if you give him knowledge how to earn his livelihood, that is better gift. So people are suffering for want of knowledge. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is giving knowledge to the whole world. Not only that, we are giving //prasādam// also, hundreds and thousands of people. We are not that simply we are giving knowledge, but we are giving, we are inviting everyone, "Come, live with us peacefully. Take Kṛṣṇa //prasādam// and be Kṛṣṇa conscious." This is our movement. That's all?

**Acyutānanda:**
One more.

**Prabhupāda:**
One more?

**Acyutānanda:**
"What are the ways and means for controlling temptations and conquering desires?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Mm?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
What is the way for controlling our desires?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca// [SB 11.2.42], //paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 2.59]]]. You have to give better engagement, then they will give up this inferior engagement. //Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate. Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// means if you get better engagement, then you can give up inferior engagement. You must have some engagement. Without engagements he will become mad. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to give better engagement. So when he's engaged in better type of activities, he forgets all this inferior acti... That is explained, //bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra ca// [SB 11.2.42]: as soon as one become devotees, he naturally becomes reluctant. Just like these American and European boys and girls, they are little advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness; they have immediately given up all these inferior engagements of drinking and illicit sex and meat-eating. They have given up. This is the way. You give them better engagement and they'll give up this inferior engagement. That is the pushing of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.
