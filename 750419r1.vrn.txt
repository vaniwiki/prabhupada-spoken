**Prabhupāda:**
...the animals and human beings. Then they can work. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni,// then //parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Now //parjanyaḥ,// cloud and rain, that is required. //Parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.// And //yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Then you have to arrange for sacrifice. So in the Kali-yuga the costly sacrifice is not possible. Therefore from the //śāstra// we understand, //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. //Sumedhasaḥ,// "one who has got good brain substance." There is one word in //Bhagavad-gītā, alpa-medhasaḥ:// "poor brain substance." So we require some //sumedhasaḥ,// not //alpa-medhasaḥ. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasaḥ// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. They are making plans by their material concoction that... That is //antavat.// That will be finished. //Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasaḥ.//

The things are there already, especially in India. We have got everything ready, and especially this land India. It is specially meant for God realization. By the birth, one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, or God conscious. Still in these days, whenever... You have seen in Hyderabad. Although your conference was going on, still, at least five thousand men were attracted to hear me. [guest laughs] And I was speaking the dry subject of Kṛṣṇa. So India is so fortunate. They are still ready to assimilate the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. The land is so fortunate. So we must give them the chance. That is our duty. That is government's duty. That is teacher's duty. That is father's duty. That is explained in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata. Pitā na sa syāt. Guru's// duty. One who has got the chance of accepting something very easily... The guardians... The first guardian, the government; the second, the father; then the teacher; then so many, friends, relatives---that chance should be given. So Nandajī is thinking... He is an experienced...

**Indian man (1):**
Actually, Krishna Raya[?] has performed there. Nandajī had taken that troupe there.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he is also a big man. Now he is retired from politics?

**Indian man (1):**
No. He is very much... He is more in politics than myself. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
So, on that point I have taken his ideas very nice, his thinking. He is a good thinker. And so I have taken his ideas, and I want to reply him. So any good thinker, leaders, they should do something so the India's glories... Now these people, they are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is India's glory, because we haven't got to give them anything. We are hundred years back always. When they manufacture jet plane, we manufacture sewing machine. Or cycle.

**Indian man (1):**
But we have great //paramparā// of //varṇāśrama-dharma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So we can give them these things. We can give them these things, that spiritual emancipation, and they are appreciating. So if we make ourself in India a nice program---already they are eager to take---then they will take more and more. And that will glorify India's prestige. So everything is ready there? Oh, here. You have got that letter. You can... [indistinct] [end]
