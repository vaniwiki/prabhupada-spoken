I should have spoken in Hindi, but with the permission of Śrīpāda Nṛsiṁha-vallabha Gosvāmī, because most of my students here present, they could not understand the Hindi speaking, so it is my duty to inform them the substance of his speech in English so that you can appreciate how much he has eulogized our movement.

You haven't got to be disappointed because some of the envious person, they are not accepting you as Vaiṣṇava. Śrīpāda Nṛsiṁha-vallabha Gosvāmī, quoting from many authorized scriptures, he has proved that in the matter of engaging oneself in the devotional service, there is no check, there is no impediment. That is confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: ahaituky apratihatā// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. That he has very nicely explained, quoting many authoritative statement from scriptures. And another thing: it is a fact that nobody can check //kṛṣṇa-bhakti.// It is transcendental; it is not material. Unless one acts on the platform of spiritual activities, one cannot understand why //bhakti// is //apratihatā. Pratihatā// means checked by impediments. So that is for material things. Just like a living being, a soul, he is checked by this material body. Otherwise, a living being can go anywhere, //sarva-gaḥ.// The spirit soul is free to move anywhere, but because we are now covered by the material body, we are checked. But devotional service is on the transcendental platform; it cannot be checked. Therefore in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is explained, //ahaituky apratihatā yenātmā samprasīdati.//

So I am very much pleased. I will not take much time. The //āratik// time is now. You do not be disappointed by the activities of some envious person. //Bhāgavata-dharma// is meant for the nonenvious person. //Paramo nirmatsarāṇām// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. //Nirmatsara.// Anyone who is contaminated by envy, he cannot become Vaiṣṇava. He may be a envious animal, but Vaiṣṇava is //paramahaṁsa, parama nirmatsarāṇām.// He is not envious. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// Vaiṣṇava, //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// Śrī Prahlāda Mahārāja says, "My Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva, I have no problems." //Naivodvije para duratyayā-vaitaraṇyāḥ tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. "Personally, I have no problem. But I am sorry, very sorry, because...," //tato vimukha-cetasa,// "those who are bereft of Your devotional service, for them I am sorry." So Vaiṣṇava is sorry for others' difficulties. Otherwise Vaiṣṇava has no difficulty. He is //aprākṛta.// So,

> māṁ ca vyabhicāriṇi-
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyā...
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

He is on the Brahman platform. He is not on the material platform. Material platform means I am envious of you; you are envious of me. This is material platform. So as soon as one becomes envious of something, he is on the material platform. He is not Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava is on the spiritual platform. He is //udāra, para-duḥkha-duḥkhī,// as Prahlāda Mahārāja... //Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. The materialistic persons are described as //vimūḍhān,// fools, rascals. They do not know. And the Vaiṣṇava platform is not //vimūḍhān---paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ.// That is described.

> vidyā-vinaya-sampanne
> brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
> śuni caiva śva-pāke ca
> paṇḍitāḥ sama...
> [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]

That is //paṇḍita.// That is //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage. //Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. So these are... There is authoritative statements in all the //śāstras,// but if we do not care for //śāstra// and //sādhu// and devotees, we manufacture our own way of life, that is different things. We have nothing to speak about that. On the whole, I am very much thankful to Śrīpāda Nṛsiṁha-vallabha Gosvāmī that he has come, taking so much trouble. He is old man. And he has advised you that you stick to //bhakti// principle, and that will make your life successful. You have come so far, distant place, in Vṛndāvana, from America, Australia, Africa, spending so much money. So... Of course, there is no consideration of material profit and loss. But your anxiety, //laulyam,// that will make you successful in receiving the mercy, unalloyed mercy, of Kṛṣṇa. So you have nothing to be disappointed. You go on with your prescribed duties, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// and observe the rules and regulation as they have been given to you. Chant your numerical strength of beads, and your life will be successful.

Thank you very much.
