**Amogha:**
Well, he's a very..., actually he's a big man, and therefore he's very busy. In their terms he's a big man. He had a lot of seminars yesterday taking him up late at night working. I'll send him something to read.

[break] ...problem. As he sees it, the biggest problem is that the industrial civilization, the big companies and consumer society, are taking the natural resources at such a pace that they are causing pollution and they are causing in the future a great scarcity of certain products, and, in other words, he thinks they're ruining the earth.

**Śrutakīrti:**
He said, "irreparable damage." They'll never be able to again restore what they've taken.

**Amogha:**
So he's very perplexed by the future, say, a hundred years from now, what will happen if we go on at the rate we're going, taking natural resources.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like they are taking petrol. This is natural resources. They are taking continually.

**Amogha:**
But he says the CSIRO, most of the people there are involved in researching how to exploit the natural resources more. So he's a little bit different because he's trying to present a clear warning that this is happening. But then again, he doesn't have any potency to stop it. It seemed that when you were speaking to him he related bodily consciousness with the selfishness of the industrialists when they're exploiting natural resources like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are doing so many things. They are killing cows for their own benefit. So many animals they are killing. Birds.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yeah, he was making a claim that he was against this because all these cows are in the central part of Australia, and just by their walking they're causing the topsoil to become loosened and taken by the wind. So he was against all this mass slaughtering. But at the same time, he's eating meat. Also he was saying how everyone is interested in making the fast dollar, the... [break]

**Amogha:**
The industrialists and technologists say that they will keep using and using and using, and when they run out they will invent something else to take the place. When they run out of oil then they will use sun energy or some other energy. And whenever they say that they're running out of something, they say, "Oh, we'll invent something, and we'll do something to arrange it."

**Prabhupāda:**
Why they are thinking of the future, and they do not think of themself that whether he was going to be a cat and dog? He is thinking of industrial resources future and not for himself.

**Śrutakīrti:**
It shows that it's a natural tendency to think about the future.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is there, certainly.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes. But because they are in ignorance they have to think of so many other things for the future, and they're not thinking of themselves.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, in future if you become a shrub like this, what you are going to do for that? This may be also your future. Now there are so many hells for different kinds of sinful activities. Everything is described.

**Amogha:**
I was reading in the //Bhagavad-gītā// last night. In Chapter Two there was a verse where it says, something about, "Of the existent, there is no cessation, and the nonexistent, there is no continuation," something like that. But in the purport it says that one can understand the Supreme by studying himself. What does that mean: by analytical study of oneself one can understand the Supreme?

**Prabhupāda:**
So you could not understand? You have got all propensities, different; the similar propensities are there in God. Because you are part and parcel of God, the chemical composition in drop of water from the sea is the same. In the sea it is in bigger quantity, and in the drop in smaller quantity. And therefore your composition you can study, and the same things are there. Therefore He is a person, big person.

**Śrutakīrti:**
That is //sāṅkhya-yoga?//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. This is my interpretation. He is also creating; you are also creating. You can create a motorcar and He can create a huge, gigantic sun globe. The same process. As you are controlling the aeroplane by air condition or by controlling the air, similarly all these planets are there. It is by His plan it is moving with the air. Big, big planets, there is no question of gravitation. That is nonsense. It is by His arrangement it is moving in the air. Just like big, big cloud containing millions of tons of water floating in the air. How it is being done? Eh? Millions of tons of water are floating in the air. That we see daily. So similarly, all these planets are floating by His arrangement. Not only floating. Making center that polestar, all the planets are moving around it, even the sun. So it is by His arrangement.

**Śrutakīrti:**
So the sun is the center, or the polestar?

**Prabhupāda:**
Polestar.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Is the center of the universe.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not in the center. Sun is in the center; the polestar in the extreme north. [break]

**Śrutakīrti:**
You were saying yesterday how foolish it is to think that God is creating planets without putting any life on them. The scientists are saying there is no life on any planet. Then why would He create a planet unless there was life on it?

**Prabhupāda:**
All rubbish theory. Life is mentioned in //Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-gaḥ:// "everywhere." And why these rascals say there is no life?

**Amogha:**
They want to see with telescope.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is nonsense, this telescope. That is their defect. They do not admit the imperfection of the senses. What we calculated? How many billions?

**Śrutakīrti:**
To the sun?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, the length and breadth.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Oh, it is four billion miles.

**Prabhupāda:**
Four billion miles. So how much the telescope can see? Can you see four billion miles? Eh? Where is the telescope? If you cannot see perfectly even ten miles, with telescope you can see, say, a hundred miles or something more, something. But can you see four billion miles?

**Śrutakīrti:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then? What is the use of this telescope? [pause] Nothing will be finished. God's resources are unlimited. But //they// will be finished. Making research, research, they will be finished. God's resources will not be finished, but they will be finished. Unnecessarily they have created necessities of life. In this way, in blind capacity, they... After fifty years, where this big geographist is going? He does not know. And he is thinking what will happen hundred years' time.

**Śrutakīrti:**
He's thinking that in a few hundred years the resources will be used up. He doesn't... He's thinking the resources will be used up.

**Prabhupāda:**
But before that, you will be finished, so why you are anxious?

**Amogha:**
He's worrying about the civilization.

**Prabhupāda:**
Civilization, but you will be finished. You will not take part in the civilization. You have no belief in the next birth. So why you are thinking like that? You will be finished yourself. Why you are worried? Suppose I have come here for three weeks. If I simply think, "What will happen hundred years after I am in Australia?" what is my business? I will go away by three weeks. Why shall I bring so much thoughts about "What will happen, Australia, hundred years after?" You are going to be cats and dogs or something, or grass or anything else. But you will be finished. Then why you are anxious for Australia?

**Amogha:**
This is my country.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is your country? You will be kicked out after some years, that's all. Where is your country? You cannot stay in your country. First of all you make sure that it is country. Where is your country? I have come here for three weeks. Shall I consider it is my country?

**Amogha:**
Your country is India; our country is Australia.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Anywhere, I come here for three weeks or some three years or some three hundred years. What are these in comparison to the eternal time? So why I am thinking like that, "my country," "your country," "this country"? Everyone will be kicked out: "Get out." You country will stay here permanently. This is called fourth-class man.

**Śrutakīrti:**
It is like that woman you speak about. She goes into the marketplace: "How will I feed all these men?" [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Only she is anxious: "Oh, so many men. Where shall I keep them? Where shall I give them food?" And in the evening her son brought him [her]---everything is finished. [laughter] Everything is finished by the evening. Nobody in the market. And she was very much anxious, "How to feed them? How to keep them?" It is like that.

**Amogha:**
But even if we can't stay here, we all have to die. Our sons and their sons, if we do something now, then maybe they won't have to suffer so much in the future.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why you are thinking of your son's future, your grandson's... Why don't you think of your future?

**Amogha:**
It makes me happy to think that they'll be happy.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is madness. That is madness.

**Amogha:**
If I get insurance policy, then they will have some money after I go...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that is natural, that you think of future. But the foolishness is you don't think of your future. That is foolishness. This is natural. Because every living entity is eternal; therefore he has future. But for himself he is thinking, "There is no life, next." And he is thinking of the life which will come as his grandson or son, what will be their future. And he is blind about the own future. This is fourth-class man. Suppose some danger is coming. So shall I take care of you: "How you will be saved? How you will be saved?" How I will be saved---that is my first business. That he does not know. There have been many cases, there is all of a sudden fire. The man has left everything, and his baby was there. He was crying, "Oh, I have left my..." The natural tendency---"First of all save me." Self-preservation is the first law of nature. So why did he forget about his baby? Now, when he comes out, he is thinking about baby. This is natural, that he does not think about himself; he is thinking about future generation. "What nonsense will come as my son or grandson?" Just see. This is fourth-class man.

**Amogha:**
So he should first save himself, then think about how to save others.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. First of all he must know what he is actually saving. That he does not know. He is thinking of his country. Suppose next birth he becomes a cow and his countrymen will send him to the slaughterhouse. So what is the use of having your country? The same country, the national... The cow is also national, you are also national, but the law is the cow is to be sent to the slaughterhouse. Therefore they have been all described as //mūḍhāḥ,// rascals, only rascals. Except a Kṛṣṇa conscious person, all persons are rascals. Do you admit or not?

**Amogha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is authoritative statement of Kṛṣṇa. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. So these classes of men do not surrender to Kṛṣṇa. So anyone who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he comes within these categories. This is a plain description if we believe in //Bhagavad-gītā.// All rascals.

**Amogha:**
But he would say, "There are many people also like me who... We don't harm anybody. We just live our own life, and..."

**Prabhupāda:**
But you harm yourself. Because you are a rascal, you do not know what is your future. You do not harm others, but you are harming yourself. You do not know what you are and how you are harming yourself. You are such a rascal. You pose to be that you do not make any harm to anyone, but you are doing harm to yourself. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. You do not know what is the harm to yourself. You are such a fool. So what is the use of...? Nobody can do any harm to anyone. Everything is going on, nature's law. But you are doing yourself harm for your interest. You are such a fool.

**Amogha:**
But I feel pretty happy. Everything seems to be... I have a good job.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. The ass also feels happy, dog also feels happy. So you are like ass, dog, like that. They also feel happy.

**Amogha:**
They don't go to cinema.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is not... There are many living entities in the cinema. There are ants, the lizards, rats. So what is the use of being in cinema? So you are also one of them, that's all. There are no rats in the cinema house? [laughter]

**Amogha:**
At the drive-ins they also have birds. At the open theater they have birds also, and cats.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Amogha:**
But man has been progressing for so many years. Surely they can't all be bad.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are not progressing. They are rascals. What their meaning of progressing, these fourth-class men? That is our verdict, Kṛṣṇa's verdict. What progress? If you have made progress, then you are thinking, "What will happen, future?" Where is your progress? You rest assured that "We have made so much progress. Now there will be no more problem." So why you have engaged so many so-called rascals again to solve the problems? Where is your advancement? If you are full of anxiety, then where is your happiness? Is anyone who is full of anxiety, he is happy? Is he happy?

**Amogha:**
Well, not... But if he takes some intoxicant or he goes to cinema, then he feels better.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are adding rascal upon rascal. [laughs] They do that, you know. They are fools. They are rascals. The same philosophy: if you have got enemy in the front, you close your eyes and he kills you. The rabbit, they do that. As soon as they find some big animal, they close.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Ostriches stick their head in a hole in the ground.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Amogha:**
But there must be some progress, because so many are joining the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are making real advancement. //Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.// Their these material anxieties will be over. They are making advancement. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. By chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa their dirty heart will be cleansed, and as soon as it is fully cleansed, the problems of material existence will be over. No more anxiety.

**Amogha:**
They seem happy, but... The devotees of Kṛṣṇa seem happy, but they don't do much practical work. They always sing and dance and ask for some money. But they don't work any practical thing. We're doing so many practical things.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dancing is not working? And writing book is not working? Selling book is not working? What is working then? Hmm? Like monkey jumping? Yes? That is working?

**Amogha:**
But we are helping people practically, like in the hospital or the alcoholics...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, what... How you are helping? Do you think if one goes to hospital he will not die? And how you are helping? You are thinking you are helping.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
But he lives longer.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another foolishness. How long you will live? When the time of death comes, you will not live longer even by a moment. When a man is going to die, his life is finished. Can your injection, medicine, give one minute's life more? Is there any medicine?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Well, there seems to be.

**Prabhupāda:**
No...

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Sometimes when they give medicine, they live longer.

**Amogha:**
They say that by perfecting heart transplant they may make people live...

**Paramahaṁsa:**
They say that by perfecting heart transplant they may make people live...

**Prabhupāda:**
They may say, they... Because we take them as rascals, why shall I take their words? We should consider them a rascals, that's all. [someone shouts nastily in background---Prabhupāda barks at them] [laughter] Another rascal. He is enjoying life. So the world is full of rascals. We must be very much pessimistic, not at all optimistic of this world. Unless you become pessimistic, you will not be able to go back to home. If you have little attraction for this world---"It is good"---then you have to remain here. Yes. Kṛṣṇa is so strict.

**Amogha:**
But Jesus said, "Love thy brother as thyself." So if we love our brother...

**Prabhupāda:**
That we are loving. We are giving Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is loving, real loving. We are giving him eternal life, eternal bliss. Unless we love them, why we are taking so much trouble? The preacher must love the people. Otherwise why he is taking? He can do it for himself at home. Why he is taking so much trouble? Why in eighty years old I have come here if I do not love? So who can love better than a preacher? He loves even the animals. Therefore they are preaching, "Don't take meat." Do they love the animals, rascals? They are eating, and they love their country, that's all. Nobody loves. It is simply sense gratification. If somebody loves, he is Kṛṣṇa conscious, that's all. All rascals. They are after their own sense gratification, and they will put a signboard, "I love everyone." This is their business. And fools are accepting, "Oh, this man is very philanthropic." He does not love any man. He loves only senses. That's all. The servant of the senses, that's all. Everyone is working because he is getting money. Where is the love? The minister, the prime minister, everyone, if they say, "No money, no salary," nobody will go there. He takes the opportunity of taking money by bribe, by this way. Therefore they are: "I love your country. Elect me as president." That's all. What this president has done, Nixon? He has stolen so many things. So what is his love for the country?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
He was a bad one, but some of them are good.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, some... Everyone is bad. The man who is talking, he is also bad man. Everyone is bad man. Here there is no good man. Do you think in the prison house any good men go there? All criminals. So anyone who has come in this material world, he is a criminal. Therefore he is punished by this material body, simply suffering. Why you have covered? Because this body cannot tolerate this cold. So the body means suffering, material body. Anyone who has got this material body, he is suffering. Nobody is enjoying. Is a wrong idea. He is thinking... That is called //māyā.// He is suffering, but he is thinking, "I am enjoying." This is called //māyā.//

**Amogha:**
But the schoolteachers and the church leaders and my parents and grandfather, they all seem to think that it's all right what we're doing, so...

**Prabhupāda:**
But because they are all rascals. Therefore we say all rascals. They may think like that, but our conclusion is anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is a rascal. That's all. He may be my teacher or father or anyone. He is a rascal. That is stated in the //Bhāgavata, pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt, gurur na sa syāt, na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum// [[books:sb:5:5:18|[SB 5.5.18]]]: "One who cannot save me from the impending danger of birth, death, old age and disease, he is not my father, he is not my teacher, he is not my //guru,// he is not my kinsman, he is not my wife, he is not my husband." So many list. So who has got this knowledge, how to save one from the cycle of birth, death and old age? It is only we, Kṛṣṇa conscious people. We are teaching, "Stop your this cycle of repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. Come to eternal life and blissful life." So we are the only friends. All are enemies even in the shape of friend or father or teacher---enemies. They do not know the art. What they will do? Suppose if you have got a very good father. If he does not know how to stop your gliding down to accept a dog's life, then what does he do simply by giving some food? And making a fatty dog?

**Amogha:**
But if what you say is true, why don't more people know about it? There are so many teachers. There are spiritual teachers and...

**Prabhupāda:**
They will not know. That... These rascals say, "No, it will not be accepted." Just like yesterday they came, all the psychiatrists. As soon as we prescribed that "This is the prescription," they said, "Oh, it is impractical." I say that "Send your patients here. We shall make him instantly drugless." They will not accept it. "Oh, why not at home?" At home? And he will remain with the drug addict, and he will become drugless. Is it possible? The surrounding men, all drug addicts, and he will become drugless. How it is possible?

**Amogha:**
Actually, their hospital is a society where all the drug addicts get together.

**Jayadharma:**
For a free cup of tea.

**Prabhupāda:**
Good society. The group... We gave reference from //Bhagavad-gītā, saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ// [[books:bg:2:62|[Bg. 2.62]]]. Association is required. Otherwise why we are opening so many centers? Just to give them the facility of association. These men are big rascals. The world is full of rascals, and the so-called leaders, they are big rascals, that's all. They cannot make any solution. Simply take salary. //Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:19|[SB 2.3.19]]]. They are big rascals, and the small rascals accept them as leader. That's all.

**Amogha:**
That is //vox populi// of the rascals.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes. No, whole world is rascal. Anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is a rascal. Take it for granted. This is the test. That is stated in the //Bhāgavata: na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. These rascals, they do not know what is his self-interest. He is simply enamored by the external energy and trying to make adjustment of things. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīya...// He is a rascal, and his leader is also rascal. //Te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ.// These rascals do not know they are bound up, hands and legs, by the laws of nature, and they are making solution, problem. Just like this geographer is making solution and all of a sudden will die. And then another rascal will come into that place to make solution. The problem will remain, and they will come and go. They will come and go. Napoleon came for solution, Hitler came for solution, Gandhi came for solution, but when Napoleon was offered horse's urine instead of water, he could not make any solution. When Gandhi was fired to death, he could not make a solution. And they were leaders of solution. What they can do? Every one of them is under strict laws of nature. As nature will do, they will have to submit. And what they will make? They are not independent. Nobody knows where is Hitler. Such a big man, he hided or he killed himself, something done, but nobody knows. And one day he become the master of the whole universe. This is going on.

**Amogha:**
But maybe by our study... We are all imperfect, but if we keep compiling the information, then after so many years they will have all the information...

**Prabhupāda:**
They... You do not take the right information. Right information is with us. That you refuse to take. Your information is zero. Compiling up zeros does not make any value. It is all zero. Take information from us. Then it will be beneficial. You are taking information from all universe except our this solid information given by Kṛṣṇa. That is your policy. //Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. You have read this verse? "The //mūḍha,// rascal, he does not know the ultimate background is I am." That he does not know. What is the use of his information? And in the //Vedas// it is said, //yam eva viditvā sarvam idam...// There is a //mantra,// that "Only understanding Kṛṣṇa, you understand everything." //Yam eva viditvā sarvam idaṁ vedituṁ bhavanti.//

**Amogha:**
But how can we understand all this science and technology just by understanding Kṛṣṇa, just by one book? There is so much...

**Prabhupāda:**
Not one book. You cannot read them throughout your whole life, there are so many books.

**Amogha:**
I don't think they have any argument.

**Prabhupāda:**
What argument? They are fools, rascals. What argument?

**Amogha:**
Yesterday they did not know what to say.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Nobody could say against me. //Maunaṁ śamyati labdhaḥ.//[?] If they remain silent, that means they have accepted. I charge you that "You are thief," and if you don't protest, then you are thief. If you are not thief, immediately you will: "How you say? Why you have said?" There will be fight. But if you remains silent, that proves that you are thief. So they could not give us any counterargument. Therefore they accepted.

**Amogha:**
Their biggest problem is that there isn't any counterargument.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. As soon as I told them, "Who is there without father?"

**Amogha:**
Then they tried a little bit. They said, "Everyone has a father, so who's God's father?"

**Prabhupāda:**
That I answered, that "That is God."

**Amogha:**
Then they were defeated.

**Prabhupāda:**
God means that without father, He can..., He exist. That is God. That is the difference between you and God.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
How can darkness argue with the sunlight? Their trying to argue is just like darkness trying to argue with the sunlight.

**Prabhupāda:**
And that Burmese said, "We don't believe in God." And you don't believe in God? You don't... Why you believe Lord Buddha? He is God.

**Amogha:**
Then he said, "But there is no God mentioned in Buddhism. There is //nirvāṇa.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right, but you worship Buddha. Why?

**Amogha:**
Because he spoke about //nirvāṇa.// In Burma many people are Buddhist. They say they are Buddhist.

**Prabhupāda:**
'Til now, 2,600 years past from the Buddhist community, from other groups and Arabia, very big religionist or philosopher has come. They are all in darkness. It was for the time being. The Buddhist religion was for the time. Atheist class men... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Christ said, "Thou shall not kill." They killed Christ. This is the position.

**Amogha:**
When Buddha came, did most people follow him?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Amogha:**
And they stopped their [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In their religion animal-killing is strictly forbidden.

**Amogha:**
Did Śaṅkara, did he physically force the Buddhists out of India, by force?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Amogha:**
Or just teaching.

**Prabhupāda:**
By argument, by teaching.

**Amogha:**
By teaching. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see how nice flower is coming from the sand. And they say there is no vegetation. What is the difference between this sand and that sand? Sand is sand. Huh? How they are coming? Wherefrom they are getting nourishment? If there is no possibility of living being, who is coming to water it? Nobody is coming. In this place, flower, it is as good as flower grown in the land. But they are growing in the sand, you can see. You see actually in the sand things are coming out, and one rascal will say, "No, there is no life." We have to believe it? Even it is full of sand and dust, here we see dust and sand produce life, so why shall I believe these rascals who bring back sand? What is the difference between that sand and this sand?

**Amogha:**
Some scientists admit there is life there, there may be life...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, these scientists are all rascals, first of all take it. Don't believe it. "Some scientists say." Then who is real scientist? This scientist says there is no life, another scientist says there may be, then who is right? Hmm?

**Amogha:**
They have to go and see. [laughs] But they don't see any signs of civilization or buildings, so they say it may be plant life, but they don't see anything...

**Prabhupāda:**
First of all whether you have gone there. That is our charge: "You have not gone there."

**Amogha:**
That's what we are trying to do. In a few years we will find out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They might have gone to some hellish planet, where there is only sand only, and very hot, and the culprit is pushed through that deserted place to the Yamarāja. And before going to Yamarāja he has to suffer so much. There are places, copperlike, you see. So hot, and the criminal has to go on that copper land. There are mentioned for many millions of miles simply copper, and one has to pass through that to Yamarāja. So they might have gone to some such place, not to the moon planet, who is the source of vegetation even throughout the whole universe---and in his own planet there is no vegetation. Now I am sure they have not gone to moon planet. How they will go? It is beyond the sun. I was protesting that they have not gone; now I am convinced that they have not gone. The Russian scientists and the American scientists joined on the platform, "Don't expose me; I don't expose you." [laughter]

[in car] [Bengali] "You have to do your business and same I have to do my business. Let us support one another." In all other fields, they are inimical, and the scientific field they are friends. That means that if a scientist, another scientist, exposes me, then my attempt will be futile, so let us don't do it.

**Śrutakīrti:**
You don't expose me, and I won't expose you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because we are doing business, we are getting money from these rascal government, so if you expose me, then I will not get money, and if I expose you, you will not get money. Let us remain together and let them remain fools. That's all. This is it. If a common man like me can understand the whole policy, how the scientist will not understand? But they have made a compromise that "Don't expose me; I'll not expose you. And let us take money from the government." This is going on.

**Amogha:**
So the big demons are cheating the small demons, but they're all demons.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. The big animal eats the small animal. But the big animal, because he's big, does it mean that he's not animal? He's also animal. The tiger eats a dog. Does it mean the tiger is not animal? The dog is animal, the tiger is also. Animal... He is god who knows how to live without these animals. That is human life. So why shall I eat animals? I shall eat fruits, I shall eat vegetables, I shall eat nice food grains, I shall eat milk. That is human. Why shall I eat animals' blood and flesh? "No, it is very tasteful." [laughter] So what is the difference between you and dog?

**Amogha:**
They don't know how to cook, the dogs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, nature has made them like that. The human beings, they can utilize the land, they can produce so many nice foodstuffs. That is human society. What is this society? They are living in big, big skyscraper building, and for their food the slaughterhouse killing, and they are eating. Is that human civilization? All third-class, fourth-class men.

**Amogha:**
If they would only listen, they will be defenseless, but they don't listen much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they go away: "My time is over." [laughs]

**Amogha:**
Yes. "I am busy. I must go."

**Prabhupāda:**
His energy is over. Not time is over, but his energy is over. He sees that "We cannot argue with this man."

**Śrutakīrti:**
He'll not give us a chance. [break]

[out of car] [speaking to another devotee] Wouldn't it be better if you make his breakfast?

**Jayadharma:**
Certainly.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have talked with many psychiatric scientists in Los Angeles.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
All of them are [indistinct]. Even our own scientist.

**Amogha:**
[laughs] Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore he is now writing books. He is afraid of writing these such books, because his brother scientists may not like it.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śrutakīrti:**
It is like the Russians and the Americans. He doesn't want to offend the other scientists. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
If the other scientists condemn him, then he will not get service.

**Śrutakīrti:**
That's right.

**Jayadharma:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [devotees offer obeisances]

**Prabhupāda:**
You can write one essay, I'll give you some hints. Bring your notebook and //Bhagavad-gītā// also. The defect of human society is that..., present human society is that there is no high-class men. The //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase// [[books:bg:2:11|[Bg. 2.11]]].

**Amogha:**
//Aśocam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Aśocyān//

**Amogha:**
//Aśocyān.// Is that Chapter Sixteen?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, second.

**Amogha:**
//A-s-a-o? A-s-a-u?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//A-ś-o.//

**Amogha:**
//A-ś-o. Aśocyān anvaśocas tvam.// Hmm. Two, eleven.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is it?

**Amogha:**

> śrī-bhagavān uvāca
> aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ
> prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase
> gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca
> nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ
> [[books:bg:2:11|[Bg. 2.11]]]

Translation: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead said: While speaking learned words, you are mourning for what is not worthy of grief. Those who are wise lament neither for the living nor the dead."

**Prabhupāda:**
So, these classes men are now predominant.

**Amogha:**
They are what?

**Śrutakīrti:**
Predominant.

**Amogha:**
Predominant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They are taking care only of this body, which is---dead or alive---it is not the subject matter of seriousness. I shall tell you later on.

**Amogha:**
Excuse me?

**Prabhupāda:**
I'll tell you later on.

**Amogha:**
Okay.

**Prabhupāda:**
