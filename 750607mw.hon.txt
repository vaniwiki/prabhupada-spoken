**Śrutakīrti:**
[introducing recording] The following conversation takes place on June 7th, 1975, on Kailua Beach, Hawaii.

**Prabhupāda:**
...how they are beautiful.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hawaii birds? No. [break] ...all these birds?

**Devotee:**
I don't know the names. Do you know their names?

**Śrutakīrti:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think it is Bulbuli.

**Devotee:**
I don't know their names.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
They have those in India?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not this red, but bluish color.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
But of the same kind, having bunch of hair.

[break] ...three hundred varieties of birds. How many one has seen? One million. //Pakṣiṇam dāsa-lakṣakam. Dāsa-lakṣakam// means one million. [break] ...varieties of life, so many varieties of planets, sky, the sea, ocean, the mountains, the rivers, and they want to compete with God. Just see their foolishness. [laughs] Controlling nature, is their... Eh? Bali-mardana? Scientists, they want to control nature.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, they try to make it rain or stop the rain. They try different experiments.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not death? Stop death.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. They are trying that also. They are not succeeding.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the misfortune. [break] ...they are going to the sky for meeting, the Russian scientists and American scientists? [break]

**Bali-mardana:**
On big island, the island that you visited where the farm is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Bali-mardana:**
On the island with the farm, the people are..., now they are afraid that there will be a volcanic eruption and the whole island will be finished.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is such sign?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, because that volcano over there, it is still active. It is smoking. It is always smoking.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Siddha-svarūpa had said every twelve years it erupts, and I think it's been ten years since the last one or something. So it's expected that in two years...

**Prabhupāda:**
The last time it devastated? No.

**Śrutakīrti:**
I don't know. He said some damage, yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Paritally, not completely.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Partial devastation.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, when volcano is in smoke, that is dangerous. That is dangerous. [break]

**Devotee:**
Shall we sell our land, then?

**Prabhupāda:**
What will come? Trust no future, that's all. We must be always ready for destruction. Material world is like that. //Nitya anityatam.// Canakya Paṇḍita has says, //tyaja durjana-saṁsargam:// "Avoid bad men's company." //Bhaja sādhu-samāgamam:// "Always try to associate with learned, what is, //sādhu,// with devotees. Avoid this worldly men's association and try to associate with devotees." //Tyaja durjana-saṁsargam bhaja sādhu-samāgamam,// and then //smara nityam anityatam:// "And always think that everything here in this material world is for few days." That's all. //Tyaja durjana-saṁsargam bhaja sādhu-samāgamam.// [break] //Anityatam.// [break] ...be the motto of life. [break] ...associate with the materialistic person. Try to associate with devotee, and always think that this world is for few days. That's all.

**Ambarīṣa:**
This world is what?

**Prabhupāda:**
For few days.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Oh, yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nityam anityatam.// [break] ...other. //Kuru puṇyam aho-ratram:// "And act piously, day and night." This should be the motto.

**Bali-mardana:**
That is nice prescription. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...yam aho-ratram.// [break] Civilization is just the opposite. Always act sinfully, not //kuru punyam aho-ratram.// Twenty-four hours act sinfully.

**Harikeśa:**
It seems that practically every single person in society today is going to have to go to one of those hells.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Harikeśa:**
Every single person in society today is going to have to go to one of those hells.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break]

**Bali-mardana:**
...reads about the different hells, he'll become scared. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...animals. The animals... You keep the animals here, and take one of them, slaughter---they will think, "I am safe." This is animal. All of them will think, "Oh, I am safe. He is being taken. That's all." This is their dull brain, the modern animals.

[break] //...paśuḥ.// These two-legged animals, they will think like that.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
They say that if you have a herd of sheep and one..., the first part of the herd falls off of a cliff, then all the rest of them will simply walk off the cliff.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is called //veriya dāsan.// In Hindi, //veriya dāsan.//

**Paramahaṁsa:**
What is that called?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Veriya dāsan.//

**Paramahaṁsa:**
//Veriya dāsan.// What does that mean?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, //veri// [//bherhi?//] means lamb or sheep. Their [indistinct]... If you can push one of them in the slaughterhouse, all of them enter. This is called //veriya dāsan.// You haven't got to endeavor to push others. You just push one only. "//Fut, fut, fut, fut, fut, fut, fut,//" they all enter. [laughter] In Hindi it is called //veriya dāsan.// Just cheat one //veri,// and all others will be followers. [break] Long ago, when we were boys, we saw one comic cinema. That old cinema player was... His name was Max Linder. Max Linder. So this Max Linder was going to a ball dance, and he was waiting in the park, and the ball dance coat, you know? It has got a tail. So he was sitting in a bench, and some naughty boys came and they, what is called, nailed the tailing part. So when he got up it became torn, like... So his..., this hip was visible. So when was dancing in the ball, others were seeing his, "What is this?" [laughter] So he went to the mirror, he saw, "Oh?" So he began to dance and show everyone like this. So others said, "What is this?" "This is the latest fashion. This is the latest fashion in ball dancing." "Oh?" Then all cut their tail coat. You see? "The latest fashion."

**Devotee:**
That's how they got the cut now. There's a cut in the coat in the back.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the //veriya dāsan.// [break] ...taken the story from the Aesop's, no, //Hitopadeśa. Laṅguli-hīna śṛgala,// a jackal without tail. So this is the world. Any nonsense you do, and if you say, "It is the latest fashion," everyone will take. The mini-skirt. One girl made it, so all girl. The //veriya// not only amongst the sheeps, and the so-called animal sheeps also do that, human sheeps. //Harer nama// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. [break] ...very deep there, the water? They are standing.

**Bali-mardana:**
Their... The surfboards are sticking out of the water. They are holding on to them. But it is not very deep---about six feet. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...might be increasing? No.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
This is a spot that has a very large crab population. Many crabs are living here, big ones.

**Prabhupāda:**
They catch.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They say it is very good eatables.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Yes, [laughing] they say like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
And crabs?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Clams.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, no? What is called?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Crabs and clams and lobsters...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Lobster is very popular.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Oh, yes. That is a big delicacy. One lobster, if you buy it in the restaurant, they sell it for at least five dollars.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Usually closer to ten dollars, for one lobster. Very costly. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...import lobster from India. I have seen it. Lobster from Cochin.

**Bali-mardana:**
South India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, South India. Lobster and this, what is called? //Labhanga?//

**Manasvī:**
Cloves.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cloves. And these cashew. Cashew is produced in India.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...big, big European companies for doing this business in Cochin.

**Bali-mardana:**
They were set up by the British?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, and Greeks. [break] Americans don't care for this business. They want machine.

**Bali-mardana:**
They do not care for the [indistinct] business. [break] Europeans consider Americans a little bit barbarian, a little bit uncivilized.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Bali-mardana:**
Because they say that they do not have very much manners, etiquette.

**Prabhupāda:**
They say boys, they are boys.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Unsophisticated.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes. They are in the make up; not yet fully civilized. [break]

**Manasvī:**
I was thinking if you would like to stay here for Ratha-yātrā we can make it big Ratha-yātrā here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ratha-yātrā?

**Manasvī:**
Yes. [break] ...different places, you like to stay here in this nice place, you can translate. Everyone wants you to stay here. I heard one of your letters quoted in Śrī Govinda's letter that you like Ratha-yātrā very much. So I think you would like to go somewhere. So if we can have it here, you can attend here.

**Prabhupāda:**
What he is doing?

**Śrutakīrti:**
Cleaning his fishing nets. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...ratha?//

**Manasvī:**
We can build it. We have few carpenters here, four or five carpenters. We can build it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
If you can build it, do it. I may be here or may not be here, but you observe the Ratha-yātrā. [break] ...trying to make Ratha-yātrā in Kurukṣetra. That is the origin of Ratha-yātrā. [break] It is light?

**Manasvī:**
Light. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...introduce in India two places: one at Kurukṣetra, one at Bhuvaneśvara. Ratha-yātrā. [break] ...the cost of one house like this?

**Ambarīṣa:**
One of those condominiums?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
The skyscraper.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Oh, the whole building?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Fifty million dollars.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Fifty million.

**Śrutakīrti:**
That is that steel boat we were looking at to get.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Śrutakīrti:**
The white boat there...

**Prabhupāda:**
White boat?

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes, the large white boat just there, that is the one we were after. That is the steel boat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Ambarīṣa:**
How much is that?

**Devotee (2):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. This one?

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes, the large one, the biggest one there.

**Harikeśa:**
It's not so big. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...can avoid.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Yes. [end]
