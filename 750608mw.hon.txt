**Śrutakīrti:**
[introducing recording] The following conversation takes place on Śrīla Prabhupāda's morning walk, on June 8th, 1975, at Kailua Beach, Hawaii.

**Prabhupāda:**
...devotees are described as //siddha-sattva-maṇi, siddha-sattva-maṇi.// [break]

**Harikeśa:**
I haven't listened to it all, though. That's why the tapes aren't done. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...people, by not believing in the next life, they have dismissed all problems. Very happy life.

**Bali-mardana:**
They have one saying, "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you'll die."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's right. Very good civilization. [break] ...Āryan civilization. This is not Āryan civilization. Barbarian. [break] A small child, he knows that "I shall become like my elder brother. I shall get this body, next body." And these people, they cannot understand that there is next body. That means their civilization is less than a child's civilization. [break] //...dehantara prāptiḥ.//

**Bali-mardana:**
Even every child knows that "When I grow up, I will have a different body,"...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
...but they do not know.

**Prabhupāda:**
These people, they do not understand. What kind of civilized men they are? Less than a child, and they are proud of their science. [break]

**Devotee:**
They're trying to catch some fish.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
What are they doing?

**Devotee:**
They're fishing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Devotee:**
Crabs. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...fisherman?

**Devotee (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They keep this side open and this side covered. You see that?

**Devotee (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Front side covered, back side open. [break] ...some fishermen. [end]
