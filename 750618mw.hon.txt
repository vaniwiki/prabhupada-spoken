**Harikeśa:**
[introducing recording] Morning walk, June 18th. [break]

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...their own food, it takes working eight hours for three months. So three months, if they work hard---hard means eight hours, not more than---then the whole year's provision is there.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. Simply they have to harvest time, maybe two hours a day. Farming or being in the countryside also seems to be... In itself, working in the countryside rather than in a factory seems to be more conducive for thinking, even while they're working.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is a fact. This factory working is most demonic. It is not required at all. For the interest of a few persons this device has been invented. Therefore the Communist movement is there. And the China has found the communistic movement in Russia is defective, because although it is communistic, the whole idea of exploitation by the powerful is there.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, that is their argument actually.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And that is the fact. Chinese Communism will be perfect if they take little instruction from us. We are also Communist, Kṛṣṇa Communist. We want that everyone should be happy. The communistic philosophy is also like that. They want to see everyone happy. But they have made a materialistic center. That will not help. People are attracted to these bad habits of materialistic civilization. The most important is that sex and intoxication and meat-eating and gambling. So their attraction has to be changed. Otherwise, although these Chinese, they are pushing in the village, that village also will be a brothel. They must have some attraction. Where is that attraction? Just like the hippies, they do not like this civilization, but the attraction for the sex and intoxication they could not give up. So they remain the nasty again in a different way. The process should be //mayy āsakta-manaḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. That attraction. //Mayy āsakta.// "The attraction which is..., should be changed to Me." This //yoga// should be practiced. Then it will be all right. The same example: if you keep the dogs as dog, there is no possibility of making a peaceful dog society. That is not possible. You have to change their doggish quality. Then there will be peace. How you can expect peaceful society amongst the dogs?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Actually the Chinese are attempting artificially to keep the people...

**Prabhupāda:**
But they do not know that where is the defect. Defect is that everyone has got some attraction. Somebody has attraction for his personal self; somebody has got attraction for wife, children, family; then attraction for society. In this way they talk of many things. They have come to attraction of humanity. They are all nonsense. The attraction is for sense gratification under different names only. My attraction for family is not for their benefit. By my sense gratification the family members help me; therefore I am attracted. The wife gives me pleasure; therefore I like wife. The wife also likes husband because husband gives pleasure. Otherwise, there is no attraction. As soon as the husband and wife fails to give pleasure---divorce.

The son goes out. The daughter goes out. So everyone is prone to some attraction. So if you keep them in the material attraction, then you can change the name; the disease will continue. That is the difficulty. You can change the name from this "ism" to that "ism," but every "ism" is material. //Mūḍhā nābhijānāti.// That is also... "The //mūḍhā,// these rascal, they do not know //mām,// Me, Kṛṣṇa," //param avyayam,// "inexhaustible pleasure." Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure. In the Vṛndāvana there is sporting. There is association with young girls, father, mother. Everything is exactly like this. And in any circumstance they are happy. It is not that in Vṛndāvana Kṛṣṇa is a //sannyāsī;// He cannot see the face of woman. It is not like that. [chuckles] But because it is spiritual, it is all-attractive. There are also the trees, animals, the river, the fruits, the flowers, the father, the mother, the beloved girls, beloved boys, sporting among the cowherd boys, going to the forest, the cows and calves---everything. So that attraction is required.

The Māyāvādī philosophers, they are thinking, "Again attraction like this? So make it zero, no attraction. Become zero." So their philosophy is zero philosophy. That is also no information of the spiritual world. Buddha philosophy and Māyāvāda philosophy, //śūnyavādī, nirviśeṣa,// without varieties, or zero. Without varieties means zero. So two philosophers. But therefore they invent, "Anything is all right." They invent. After all, they want zeroism. [break]

[on walk] //...pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// [break] ...one increases the attraction for Kṛṣṇa, they will never be happy. [break] ...simply changing attraction on the material platform under different names, that will be failure. [break] Dr. Wolfe is missing that evolution?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Dr. Wolfe? Is he missing the evolution?

**Prabhupāda:**
He was speaking biological?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Ah, I think he was not understanding it so well.

**Prabhupāda:**
His understanding that biological, not our.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Yeah, he's thinking biological evolution instead of transmigration of the soul. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...go-kharaḥ.// Anything evolving on the bodily concept of life, he remains an animal. That is the defect of the Western philosophy.

[break] ...philosophy, the dog's tail. He is always this way, material way. [break]

> ...buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke
> sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma-idya-dhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

//Go// means cow; //kharaḥ// means ass. [break] ...also nowadays it has become a fashion to keep dog.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, and to put stool on the sidewalk. Wherever there is dogs, there is stool all over the sidewalk.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the modern civilization. They are avoiding cow dung and associating dog stool. [laughs] This is modern... Cow dung is so beneficial. That they are avoiding. And they are associating dog stool. The dog mentality. The master and the servant, and the, er, dog, both of them watching. The master writes by signboard... What is that? "Keep away. Keep away. Private property." And the animal also making, "//Gow! Gow! Gow!//" Both of them are dogs. He is making "//Gow! Gow!//" by signboard, and he is doing it as nature, but both of them are dogs. One is two-legged dog, another is four-legged dog.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Man keeps dog as an extension of his own doggish mentality, as an extension of himself.

**Bali-mardana:**
The dog... Sometimes the dog and the person, they look the same.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They look alike. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
It's often seen that an owner of a dog looks just like that particular dog. They look very much alike, and they have similar personalities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That's a fact, because the subtle body is doggish, and he is going to be a dog next life. //Tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]]. Because he is always thinking of his dog, always, therefore he is going to be a dog.

**Bali-mardana:**
By association.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Saṅgāt sañjayate kāmaḥ// [[books:bg:2:62|[Bg. 2.62]]]. The desire becomes according to association.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Everybody that's walked by today has had a dog. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, why you are laughing? [break] ...two without association of dog. They have developed that consciousness, dog consciousness. [break]

**Bali-mardana:**
...thinking when the dog has to pass stool, 'cause then they have to take him outside. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...the statistics, how many dogs are there in the United States?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, there are. There are more dogs than...

**Prabhupāda:**
Than human being?

**Bali-mardana:**
No, no.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
I think there might be.

**Bali-mardana:**
There are many millions, though.

**Ambarīṣa:**
I think there's more than humans.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Maybe dogs and cats combined. [break]

**Bali-mardana:**
The people, they feed their dog and cat so much food that millions of human beings could be fed from the food. Because so much grains are required... They feed them meat, but so much grains are required to produce that food.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
More money is spent on food for dogs in the United States than for babies.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. [break] He was saying that in the recent food crisis in the United States, 18% of the people started eating dog food because there's so much...

**Bali-mardana:**
Cheaper.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They use such high quality beef, and based on so many grains and everything. And they use grains themselves. Milk products. [break] They're even learning how to eat dog food. Even developing... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...barks in the beach, you cannot walk without seeing dog. More footprints of the dogs than human being. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...actually give dogs more rights also, in a sense. For instance, if you... [break] ...and a human being, every time you walked, if there was a human being yelling at everyone who walked by and was going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! You get away! Get away! Get away!" then soon the man would be arrested for being a nuisance or a threat to people. But a dog is allowed to do that. He can stay there and yell and yell at everybody... [break]

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...and Russian, they are different country. Chinese, Oriental; Russian, Occidental.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. Like all Occidental countries, or at least in the United States, there is the philosophy that if you have sex, that your sexual energy will not be lost. In other words, their feeling is that one doesn't lose his health or strength from having too much sex or from using his sexual energy, whereas the Chinese, they are very... Everyone in the society, I guess for centuries and centuries, have accepted that even for physical strength and mental strength it's very important not to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Indulge in sex.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...indulge in sex, so that it's just a cultural thing that they actually try to control that just for health and mental power, whereas in the West the leaders and the people in general... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...and because they indulge too much in sex, therefore they cannot understand. That is the proof they are fools.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. [break] ...control themselves. The colonialists will go in and... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Unless they are taught about spiritual attraction, everyone will be finished. [break] ...very childhood they should be given spiritual education. [break] ...by repressive method you will never be successful.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. Repression is also due to frustration. That they can't convince someone... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Russians are doing that by repression.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. Then whenever their back is turned, the people do something else. Or they will stab them in the... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They do that? [break] Leaders?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. [break] Yes. So the only way that they can attract them is to just let them free in the school. But I said that... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
I have seen in the Hawaii University, all hippies.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. In Hawaii it's very loose. For instance, even the high schools, they're mostly very loose. But when... After it gets too loose, then the students go so much into sense gratification that then there becomes repress... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...solution, they will not take it.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, because it would mean they would have... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
He is very intelligent.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
He speaks straight from his heart, so you can... [break] ...that Yogi Bhajan's philosophy though. He wants everybody to come to the common... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...is responsible for the mistake of the followers.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. So now he must have many leaflets printed up with this information about the prime minister's //guru.// But now it's out of date. It will be out of date. He will have to print new thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
He was distributing leaflet like that?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, literature inviting people, you know, about the conference. [to driver:] You'd better honk. These guys are really... [honking of horn] [break] Is Cāṇakya Paṇḍita widely available in India?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not very important thing. It has nothing to do with spiritual, but moral instruction.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
For //kṣatriyas?//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, for everyone. You can get from India, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita. It is called //Cāṇakya-śloka,// "Verses composed by Cāṇakya." //Cāṇakya-śloka.// [//japa//]

[break] ...Western country, they have come to a stage in which by nature they are now seeking after some spiritual importance. And that is available in India. But these rascals, they are taking advantage of it and exploiting, this Guru Maharaja, these //yogīs,// these... But these people, Western people, they are searching after this. So it is our duty especially to give them the right thing. They are searching after, and they are taking advantage of it and exploiting them.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
[indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...is one of them.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, that's why they're not allowed in the United States. They're not accepted as... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
It has gone to India. [break] Yogic //āsana// exercise is very popular. They think it is spiritual, exercising the body. [break] [end]
