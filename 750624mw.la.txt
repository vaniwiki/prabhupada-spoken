====== Morning Walk ======

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
So do these people know what is the science of God?

**Jayatīrtha:**
No. But they pretend that they do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, pretending will not do. You must explain what is God. "Something," "perhaps," this is not science. [break]

**Jayatīrtha:**
...if no one else knows, they're able to fool them.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
Each man presents his own theory.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is theosophy, that is not theology. Theosophy means a system of speculation, that's all. And theology does not require. Bio//logy. Logy// means science. They say anthropology, but it is not //logy;// it is theory. "Maybe," "200,000,000's of years." What is this? //Logy// does not mean that.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Still, they're awarding Ph.D.'s in theology.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like astrology. That is a science. Eh? What is that?

**Jayatīrtha:**
But still they're awarding Ph.D.'s in theology, even they don't know anything about it.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can do. //Hiranda-pith drumayate.// When there is no tree, the small castor seed oil tree... It is not much. It becomes a very big tree. //Hiranda-pith drumayate.// The castor seed plants, they are taken as big tree. [//japa//] [break] Actually, theology is //Bhagavad-gītā.// [break]

**Jayatīrtha:**
Oh, that's nice. Very good. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Suitable?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

[break] [on walk]

**Prabhupāda:**
...means science of God. So what is that science of God? Who knows it?

**Jayādvaita:**
You do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I know. [laughter]

**Bahulāśva:**
//Jaya!// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...of God means first of all we must know who is God. This is the first. Then, what is this material world and what is my relationship with this material world and God. This is science of God. [break]

**Bahulāśva:**
...you wanted the colleges named the Vedic Theological College? Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Hmm. Don't come very near. [break] ...that the college teachers and students must be //brāhmaṇa,// not //śūdras. Śūdras// will not be able to understand the science of God. What was the... Now, Dr... What is his name?

**Bahulāśva:**
Last night?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bahulāśva:**
Dr. Mize.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dr. Mice?

**Bahulāśva:**
Mize.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, what does he say?

**Brahmānanda:**
What did he say about the lust?

**Bahulāśva:**
He said that he could give up the greed, but the lust was a very hard one for him to give up.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes.

**Dharmadhyaksa:**
He wanted to become more unselfish, but he didn't know how he could give up lust.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that can be done. If you increase your Kṛṣṇa consciousness, love for Kṛṣṇa, then you will forget this lust.

**Dharmadyaksa:**
That's what we told him, that he must chant.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the only. That is the only. There is no other second way. [break] ...conquer over lust, one has to take shelter of Madana-mohana. //Madana// means lust, Cupid, and Kṛṣṇa is Madana-mohana. He can enchant the Cupid also. [break] ...Ṭhākura, young man. At dead of night the prostitute came. How he restrained? That is... One who has realized Madana-mohana, for him these things are nothing, no enchantment. [break]

**Dharmadyaksa:**
...impressed with Your Divine Grace's energy and ability to work so much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why did you do not say, "This is spiritual energy"? Yes. [break] ...got so many dogs, nonsense. And it is solved. Just see. And he has brought dozens of... [break]

**Jayatīrtha:**
...life will be empty.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Actually that is a fact. No family, no children, so they must have some... The dog is their children, family. That is the attraction for, because mostly they do not have family.

**Jayatīrtha:**
They kill the family before they're born.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
And then, instead, they get dogs.

**Prabhupāda:**
There must be something to repose my love. So they have no family, no Kṛṣṇa. So naturally keep dog. [break] ...must be there, to love. That is my tendency. But if I have nothing, then I will have to catch the dog. What can be done? [break] ...furnish this television. Dog and television and whiskey and cigarette. That's all. [laughter] Is it not? [break] ...in India these things are entering: dog, television. And cigarette, wine has already entered.

**Bahulāśva:**
This is the degradation. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes.

**Bahulāśva:**
So much sex, everything you watch.

**Prabhupāda:**
And not only that, horrible scene.

**Bahulāśva:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Killing and like that.

**Dharmadyaksa:**
They sit hypnotized. They say we are becoming hypnotized by chanting, but actually they are hypnotized by this TV set.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that I have already explained. We must be hypnotized. If we do not become hypnotized by Kṛṣṇa, then we must be hypnotized by this television and other. [break] //...pūrṇimā?// No. Full moon, last night? No.

**Harikeśa:**
I think the full moon was Monday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Monday? [break] ...how many pages yesterday delivered?

**Nitāi:**
I finished a hundred pages.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. [laughs]

**Nitāi:**
Today I will finish the rest of Chapter Thirty.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what is decided?

**Brahmānanda:**
That he will travel with Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
That will be all right?

**Nitāi:**
Yes, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you can do that. They are composing hundred pages?

**Rāmeśvara:**
Daily?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Not a hundred pages. A hundred verses, each person. Each composer, one hundred verses approximately.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. And one verse means one page average? No.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Two verses per page.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Two or three verses per page.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Two.

**Jayatīrtha:**
So between all the composers, a hundred pages a day.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Oh, between all the composers, more than a hundred pages.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
We are going fast enough so far to do the seventeen books.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I think in one week we'll be able to finish //Madhya-līlā,// volume three, and //Antya-līlā,// Chapter One.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good news.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I went to the press right after //maṅgala āratrika,// and one of the composers had already run out the door of the temple room, and she was composing already.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break] Pālikā is also doing?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
She's going to school now. She's learning how. She will start tomorrow, I think.

**Rāmeśvara:**
In a few days.

**Prabhupāda:**
She is very expert. [break]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
...all night long, and they are not getting tired.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. Spiritual energy does not get tired. That is spiritual. When we get tired, that is material. Spiritual means one would not feel tired. //Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. //Vardhanam// means increasing. [break] ...has not come?

**Brahmānanda:**
He left last night for Las Vegas. He will go to Denver. He will see you there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Last night at two o'clock [chuckles] he took film.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yadubara.

**Harikeśa:**
You were translating, he was filming? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...night I was working from half past ten. [laughs]

**Brahmānanda:**
Then?

**Prabhupāda:**
No sleep, that's all. [break] ...I sleep, utmost, one hour or one and a half.

**Harikeśa:**
Is it proper to say that your purports are getting better every day?

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know that. [laughs] You think so?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Dr. Kapoor has commented, "The purport is superb."

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, he has said that. [//japa//] [break] ...from these waves how these birds catches...

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Fish.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fish. You cannot fish, but they know how to fish. They can see and immediately catch, while in the water. [break]

**Jayatīrtha:**
...given them the facility that they need for survival.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is the... //Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam// [[books:sb:1:13:47|[SB 1.13.47]]]. They do not know industry. [laughs] So they have to catch their eatables from the nature.

**Bahulāśva:**
The scientists say that everything has developed due to biological..., the need for biological survival.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...is of the body, not of the soul. That they do not know. [break]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
...because a certain animal needs a certain type of facility like long claws or big teeth or a certain amount of legs, they say that automatically in the course of time these things develop.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That we know also.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
They don't say that it has anything to do with God. They simply say...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is their nonsense rascaldom. Who is arranging this? You cannot do it. You cannot do it. So somebody has arranged like that. It is going on. Somebody has done. You have not done; neither you have power to do it. So that somebody is God.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
The same scientist---his name was Lamarck---he said that the giraffes have long necks because after many, many years of trying to eat leaves from trees their necks got longer. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Brahmānanda:**
He says the giraffes with the long necks in Africa, their necks... Formerly their necks were very short, but they were always trying to eat the leaves on the top of the tree, so by doing this for many, many years their necks became longer, longer, longer.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Darwin's theory.

**Dharmadyaksa:**
Yes. [break] Gradually, they'll become pigeons. Because they want sex life so much, so more and more they'll develop the bodies of pigeons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now the thing is, who are they? That they do not know. They say "They are," but who are "they"? That they do not know. [break]

**Bahulāśva:**
In //Kṛṣṇa// book and //Bhagavad-gītā// both, you explain there are five states of consciousness, beginning with //annamaya, manomaya, prāṇamaya,// like that. Do these states of consciousness manifest in different species of life?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bahulāśva:**
Yes? So like plants, for example, they would be in the //annamaya// state of consciousness?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bahulāśva:**
Simply eating?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...in Vṛndāvana, as they will be advertised, many people will come, more people, because they will come rather surprisingly, "How the Europeans, Americans have become devotee and they have their temple?" That will be attractive for them. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
Should they advertise like that?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is automatically being advertised. Just like our Māyāpur mandir is known as "//Sahib mandir.//" [laughs] //Sahib// means European. [break] It is said that... Where is Nitāi?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Nitāi?

**Prabhupāda:**
That visitors coming in full bus?

**Nitāi:**
Yes, yes. Yes, I have seen in the evenings many buses will come and park there. Everyone will get out and go see the Deities, take //prasādam,// take books.

**Prabhupāda:**
So gradually it is becoming...

**Jayadvaita:**
The buses come from town or from Delhi?

**Nitāi:**
From Vṛndāvana. Tour... Many pilgrims come, groups of pilgrims who are staying some place in Vṛndāvana, and then in the evening they will all get in their bus and come out and see our temple.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Pilgrims come from all over India?

**Prabhupāda:**
And when they will go back to their villages, they will advertise that "There is a European temple now in Vṛndāvana." And they will come. [laughs] And even the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana, they are saying that is the best temple in... Is it not?

**Nitāi:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is... But actually that is the fact. That is the fact. Our temple is the best. [chuckles]

**Dharmadyaksa:**
//Jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
Now you make a best college. Yes. Vedic Theological College, affiliated to the California University. Then it will be successful.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
People are always anxious to see what we are going to do next.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Even in Rādhā-Ramaṇa temple they were asking when is our Vṛndāvana temple going to be opened.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
...police are also becoming very favorable. Even when they arrest us, actually they want to hear Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [Prabhupāda laughs] When they arrest us, while they are writing the tickets, we read to them out of the books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was child, His mother's friend would tease Him so that He may cry, and then they will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and He will stop. To see that by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa He is pacified, to see this fun, they would tease Him first of all, and He would cry, and then they will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and they will... [break]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
In New Jersey one time we were driving very fast to try and meet you at the airport, and a police officer pulled us over, and he was very angry. We were driving very fast. And he said...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you should not drive fast. [devotees laugh] No, no, this is not good.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
We had to pick you up at the airport, Prabhupāda, and we were late.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right, but fast, drive very fast, is risky.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
So this police officer, he pulled us over. He was very angry. He said, "Let us see your license and registration." We gave it to him, and it said International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness on the registration. He said, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa." And he asked us some questions about the philosophy, and he listened very carefully, and then he said, "I cannot give people like you a ticket." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...they are pleased, but don't take undue advantage. Yes. [break] ...remain friends. That is wanted. [break]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
When they arrest us we read to them out of //Kṛṣṇa// book, the pastimes, and they listen the whole time. And sometimes for an hour and a half, two hours, they'll listen to us while we preach. Then they let us go. [break] Sometimes we are about to make an announcement to collect donations, and the police officer will be standing there like this, like he doesn't want us to do it. And we go up to him and say, "If you don't look, we'll go ahead and collect and pass out magazines." [Prabhupāda laughs] He will say, "All right."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Please close your eyes. [everyone laughs] Let us do something." [break]

[in car]

**Jayatīrtha:**
...register as a travel agent so that we can get discount on all of our tickets, airplane tickets, and then also we can work on arranging that, that these tours would stop there.

**Prabhupāda:**
The Cox and Kings, they inquired from me, "Whether you can take charge?" Guru dāsa can take charge of this. He is well acquainted with the several places. And he is loitering here and there, doing as he likes. [break]

**Harikeśa:**
...had the plan to perhaps get one bus and leave it at our place and then do tours on our own.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...airport by this way? No, the other way.

**Jayatīrtha:**
You can go this way. We usually go on the freeway. You can go straight up this street. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...freely.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. Eating, sleeping, mating and defending.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Everyone is afraid now of taking it. The crime rate has become very high.

**Prabhupāda:**
Black and white.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Negroes are envious of the white men.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Hmm. In Detroit every year one out of every five hundred people is murdered.

**Prabhupāda:**
White man?

**Jayatīrtha:**
White men and black men. Usually black men are murdering.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the reason? The same feeling as in India---Hindu-Muslim. But it is not so strong.

**Brahmānanda:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.//

[arrival at temple]

**Devotees:**
All glories to Sri...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Haribol!// [end]
