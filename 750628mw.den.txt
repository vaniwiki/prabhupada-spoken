[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
And how we are getting response from the public?

**Satsvarūpa:**
They get nice attendance on Sunday. Many people come.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. There is good hope.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Oh, yes. Good book distribution here, too.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the most successful. Wherever book distribution is going on nicely, that is successful. Because people are in gross ignorance. They are taking this temporary life as everything. Very horrible condition. We are trying to explain what is the actual life.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Here in Denver they have to compete with many bogus groups. This is the world headquarters of Guru Maharaj-ji and many other... They like to come here, the mountains. So they're always making our propaganda against them.

**Prabhupāda:**
So make propaganda against them vigorously. We have got sound footing. What these nonsense have? Tell them all nonsense, bogus. This rascal Guru Maharaj-ji is God, and the other rascals are accepting him, God? This rascaldom is going on in such civilized city? He is God?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Well, Kuruśreṣṭha, the president, says that the local people are very much disgusted with him. They don't like him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Challenge, that "I shall kick on the face of this rascal, and if he is God, let him punish me. If he is God, let him punish me. I am prepared. So come on in the public. I kick on his face, and let him do whatever he likes. I am prepared. If it is God, let me [him] kill me by his //mantra// or by his will. Then I will accept him." This is challenge, that "I shall kick on his face in public, and if he is God, let him punish me. And you are so fool that you are accepting this rascal as God? You belong to American nation, advanced. You are so fool? You have become so rascal?" Challenge like that. "He has come to cheat you, and why you are so befooled that you are being cheated?" He is convicted in the court that he is a..., what is called, deceiver. Yes. The court judgment is there. He is a deceiver.

**Brahmānanda:**
There's now a warrant for his arrest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now there's a warrant for his arrest. What he can do? And he is God? God is so cheap, and you have accepted him as God? What is this nonsense? But we give you credit, that you are searching after God. That is... So try to understand by education. What is this nonsense, blindly accepting some rascal as God? Everyone knows God is great. Is he great? Then why he is punished by the court? This is the park?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And very nice park. And not far away. [//japa//] [break] ...interested with this natural history. That means Darwin's theory, that's all. Their whole civilization is based on this Darwin's theory. How long you shall keep history? Do you know what is the history of the sun, when it was created, when it came into appearance? Can Darwin give us the history of the sun, of the moon, of the sky? Where is the history? There //is// history, but where is your history? You simply imagine, "There was a chunk, and it became manifested as the sun, moon, and I am also this..." What is this? How this cosmic manifestation came into existence, your explanation is: "There was a chunk." And what other nonsense?

[break] [on walk]

...house is on the water? No. [break] ...coughing. Catch cold?

**Harikeśa:**
Hawaii was not a very healthy place for me. Hawaii.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Harikeśa:**
All the rain and the sun and the rain. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...you will find today's text. It has given very nice example, that the prostitute changes her dress to attract people. Similarly, we are changing our dress for sense gratification. Yes. [break] Nature, material nature, has been described as the prostitute, and we are trying to become the husband of the prostitute. Has anyone become happy by becoming husband of a prostitute? [laughs] [break] ...Paṇḍita has said,

> duṣṭā bhāryā śaṭhaṁ mitraṁ bhṛtyaś cottara-dāyakaḥ
> sa-sarpe ca gṛhe vāso mṛtyur eva na saṁśayaḥ
> [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita]

A prostitute wife, //duṣṭā bhāryā,// and dupli..., what is called, duplicity? One who speaks something and heard something? What is called? Hypocrite.

**Brahmānanda:**
Hypocrisy.

**Prabhupāda:**
"Hypocrite friend and prostitute wife and servant replying," //duṣṭā bhāryā śāṭhaṁ mitraṁ bhṛtyaś cottara...,// and //sasarpe ca gṛhe vāso,// "and living in a room where there is a snake," //mṛtyur eva na saṁśayaḥ,// "he will die. There is no doubt about it. His life will be spoiled." This is the Cāṇakya Paṇḍita's. [break] ...name of this park?

**Nitāi:**
This is City Park. They call it City Park.

**Prabhupāda:**
[//japa//] [break] ...good because it is Indian climate. Is it not?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What do you think?

**Satsvarūpa:**
It is good...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Because it has got Indian climate.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Oh, yes. There's a very high altitude here. It's a mile high. They call it the Mile High City, because it's five thousand miles above sea level.

Nitāi: It's five thousand feet.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Five thousand feet. It's supposed to be good for health.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...in India up-country. Up-country, in northern India. It is very good health, Punjab, because up-country. [break] ...place, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says,

> māṭā yasya gṛhe nāsti
> bhāryā cāpriya-vādinī
> aranyaṁ tena gantavyaṁ
> yathāranyaṁ tathā gṛham

"A man who hasn't affectionate mother at home, neither very good wife, so he should immediately give up that home and go to the forest, because for him it is as good, either you remain in forest or in home." [chuckles] How intelligent.

> māṭā yasya gṛhe nāsti
> bhāryā cāpriya-vādinī
> aranyaṁ tena gantavyaṁ
> yathāranyaṁ tathā gṛham

[break] ...formerly at least one expected love from mother. That is also being finished. This is the advancement of civilization. Even mother is also not reliable, what to speak of others. A small child sleeps very sound on the lap of the mother because it thinks, "Now I am safe." And the mother is killing child. This is the advancement of... [break] ...has been many cases, a polluted woman has killed his child on account of paramour. In India there have been many cases, killed a grown-up child. In recently one of our Godbrothers' wife. You know that?

**Brahmānanda:**
She killed her son.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. On account of paramour.

**Harikeśa:**
On account of what?

**Prabhupāda:**
Paramour.

**Harikeśa:**
Paramour?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Recently, within ten years. And he committed suicide, this my Godbrother. Everyone is..., every father is affectionate to the son, and when he saw, "This is my wife, and she has killed my son." And the son saw the paramours were coming, and he says, "Who are these men coming?" You see? This question is also dangerous.

**Harikeśa:**
There was a big scandal in Gujarat.

**Prabhupāda:**
That boy who was with me... What is his name? In the beginning he went with me, San Francisco?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Mukunda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Rancor.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He told the history of his mother. Yes. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...is also a rogue.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. He was canvassing, "What is this nonsense, 'No women, no illicit sex'?" He gave car[?].

**Brahmānanda:**
He was supplying women to his son.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. "What is the wrong?" He was coming to our Second Avenue to call his son, "Why you are in this association? Come." At last, we could not save him. The father took away. [break] ...museum?

**Devotee (1):**
Some kind of boathouse or...

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
It used to be a musical thing. They'd put pontoons out in the lake. They would have concerts in there in the past. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
No mango here?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
No mango.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this? They do not...

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Only apples and peaches will grow in this state.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not mango? The climate is good for mango. [laughter]

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
In the winter it's very cold.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Very cold?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Very cold.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, what is the temperature?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Zero to twenty, thirty.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Below zero?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Sometimes, at night. Ten below.

**Prabhupāda:**
Like New York? No, New York was never below zero.

**Devotee:**
No, not that cold. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Winter, how many months is continuing?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Four or five months.

**Prabhupāda:**
Four, five months. Always snow?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Sometimes snow.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why the temperature is so low unless there is snow?

**Brahmānanda:**
The mountains. In the mountains there is snow?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
They're like eleven, twelve thousand. This is five thousand feet altitude, here in Denver.

**Prabhupāda:**
Snow falls above ten thousand feet?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Oh, yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Kashmir, that is sixteen thousand feet. [break] ...do not sink? Guarantee? [laughter] [break] ...glass building.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
That's a hospital, Śrīla Prabhupāda. The temple is in a hospital zone. It keeps the price of the land very high.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
Near a hospital is more expensive?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
All, in this area, doctors and high class, so-called high-class men live.

**Prabhupāda:**
The real doctor is he who can cure material disease. Eh? What do you think?

**Satsvarūpa:**
You said Murāri Gupta was a doctor in both ways.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [//japa//] [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
Prabhupāda, yesterday one of the library parties visited this Maharishi University, which is an estate nearby. And it's very impressive, they said. It's a big university, many buildings. But in the library they had no books of Vedic literature, so they took our books. And they said they are very glad to get them. They had nothing. Buildings, but no books.

**Prabhupāda:**
University without books. [laughter] Very good university. Anyway, if they are taking our books, that is good. What he will have? He is also another bogus man. But you people want to be cheated by this //yoga,// meditation. Therefore he has been able to get some facility. Only a selected group has come to me. Otherwise, they do not understand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Those people won't listen to any philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore they have been cheated by this man.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Even we give good explanations which they can't...

**Prabhupāda:**
They cannot understand the simple thing, that the child has got his future, the boy has got his future and the young man has got his future, so why not the old man? Such a dull head they have. You see. If the child says, "No, no, I have no future. I shall remain always child," is it possible? And similarly, if you say, "No, no. After old body, everything is finished. Now it is dead..." So they are such dull-headed men. The simple truth cannot understand. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam...// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. This is the position. The example is so nice and so simple, and they cannot understand. What is their brain? Animal brain. Dog race, horse race---they want this, rat race. That's all. Their civilization is race, dog race, horse race, rat race. That's all. They do not know anything. I am talking this simple thing because you are in confidence. Otherwise I would not have sa... Only rascals, animals, the Western people. So now it is motor race---from dog race to motor race. And does it mean if the dog is running on, race, on a car, does it mean he is not a dog? The same race, either by jumping on the land or in the motorcar. The race is the same, the dog is the same. [to devotee] So when you have come, just now?

**Brahmatīrtha:**
No, I have been here. I was walking behind.

**Prabhupāda:**
So it is a civilization of dog race. The man does not know, "By riding on a car, racing, is there any value if I do not know what is the meaning of my life?" Hmm? So this is going on. Big, big road for dog racing---that is civilization. [break] The rascal //yogīs,// they say that "By this Transcendental Meditation you will keep your dog race very nice." They are attracted, "Oh, very nice. It is very nice." That's all. //Mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.// All //mū...,// rascals. Only hope is that you distribute books, as much as possible, whole Europe, whole America. If they come to some day, they will realize what is this value. [break] ...day they will realize that what valuable books we have left for the study of the whole world. That will come. [break] ...London city there is a big hall for dog race, you know that? Many people are coming to see the dog race. You have been in London?

**Brahmatīrtha:**
No, but I know that... Yeah, I was in London, but I didn't see the dog race. But they have that in America also.

**Brahmānanda:**
In this country they have, also.

**Brahmatīrtha:**
In Florida it's very popular.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Denver it's very popular.

**Prabhupāda:**
For dog race? [laughter]

**Devotee:**
Horse race too...

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
We've gone there for distributing books before.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway... And Australia also, Sydney, oh, they are very fond of dog race. Every man is coming with big, big dog for racing purpose.

**Satsvarūpa:**
It's good gambling.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Europe, the most aristocratic person means he is keeping so many horses and so many dogs. That is aristocracy. They will ride on the horse, and taking their dogs, they will go to the forest and kill some innocent birds. That is their heroic activities. We went to see one palace in France.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes, I remember. In the hall they had all pictures of those activities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Killing birds and fox.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is aristocracy. [break] ...cannon, there was fight? Or this man is very famous hero? There was statue of Napoleon also in Paris. And they identify Napoleon and France, the same. But France is there; there is no Napoleon. [laughter] Napoleon finished, Hitler finished, Gandhi finished. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
That statue where Napoleon is, formerly there was another statue there of Louis XIV. So Napoleon, he pulled down that other statue and put his statue there.

**Prabhupāda:**
And somebody will come... Just like in Karachi they have pulled down Gandhi's statue, and I do not know what statue they placed. [break]

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
...worship these statues by the stool of crows. They worship these statues by the stool of crows.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Yes. No, if you want to worship, then worship as we do. We have Kṛṣṇa's Deity worshiping. But what is this, keep a statue on open place and the crows pass stool on the head? [laughter] What is the respectful? In the Vedic civilization does not require. They worship deity, but not like that, exposed to the crows for passing stool. That is idolism, and this is good.

**Brahmānanda:**
The Christians do this. They have Jesus Christ outside...

**Prabhupāda:**
In the open.

**Brahmānanda:**
...exposed. And they accuse us of idol worship.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [//japa//] Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Very dangerous place. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadam// [SB 10.14.58]. This is a place---in every step there is danger. We are walking in a very nice park. At any moment there may be revolution, whole thing is changed. Whole thing is..., becomes fire. Just like in India now it has become. So we should remember that here in this material world, //padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadam,// every step there is danger. Give up this place. That is the real intelligence. And the education misleading them, //māyā-sukhāya,// making gorgeous plans for temporary happiness, that's all. If in the slaughterhouse the animals are kept very comfortably, so what is the meaning of it?

**Brahmānanda:**
They'll still be slaughtered.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? What is the meaning?

**Satsvarūpa:**
No meaning.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is sure that all the animals will be slaughtered, and if the arrangement is, "All right, before being slaughtered, let them live very comfortably," is that very good intelligence? The intelligence is, "Why we shall be slaughtered?" That is intelligence. What is the meaning of slaughterhouse? Who can explain?

**Brahmānanda:**
Everyone dies there.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Dies there... A slaughterhouse, what is the meaning of this particular word?

**Devotee (2):**
They're killed brutally.

**Harikeśa:**
A specific place where all the animals are killed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. All of a sudden, many animals are killed at once. So this is also slaughterhouse. When there is need, many animals will be brought into war and killed. It is slaughterhouse. And the foolish animals, they are thinking, "We are now very comfortably situated." He forgets that "I am going to be slaughtered." //Mṛtyu-saṁsāra-sāgarāt,// the ocean of slaughterhouse. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-sāgarāt// [[books:bg:12:6-7|[Bg. 12.7]]]. A slaughterhouse, being accepted as... It is called //mṛtyu-loka. Mṛtyu-loka.// So still, they are taking it as very comfortable place. This is their intelligence: a slaughterhouse is being accepted as very nice place. What is the answer of these animals who are going to be slaughtered?

**Devotee (3):**
Animals don't have an answer.

**Kāśīrāma:**
Just a few days ago there was a plane crash, and many people died, but they were sitting very comfortably in their chairs, thinking, "It is so nice," but then it was all over, finished. And in the airport I was distributing books, and I was telling them, "You could die at any moment," but they still are thinking, "I am going to enjoy." They are not caring.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where this air crash took place?

**Kāśīrāma:**
In New York. And it landed on the freeway.

**Satsvarūpa:**
A lightning bolt hit the plane.

**Prabhupāda:**
Lighting...?

**Harikeśa:**
Thunderbolt.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Just see, slaughterhouse.

**Satsvarūpa:**
You said in your lecture the other day in Los Angeles that when that happens, that many people are killed in one place, it means that it's arranged by the Supreme. Just like Kurukṣetra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is stated by Kṛṣṇa, that "You are thinking very patriotically that you will not kill. But it is already settled. They must be killed here. I have brought them. You kill or not kill, they will be killed. That is My plan. If you want, you take credit that you have killed." This is same arrangement. It is prearranged. War means it is bringing all the animals together and kill them, finish. And that is happening every few years, after years. The Napoleon is coming for killing, and Hitler is coming for killing. Sometimes Nelson is coming for killing. But here in India the God comes for killing. Lord Rāmacandra came for killing the Rāvaṇas and Kṛṣṇa came for killing the Kauravas.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Sometimes in those mass killings pious men are killed also. At Kurukṣetra many pious men were killed?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, when there is killing, it is not that the pious men... But mostly they were saved. The Pāṇḍavas were saved. The five brothers, they remained. [//japa//] Now the moon is sour. Eh? Grapes are sour? [laughter] The jackal jumped over to catch some grapes, and when he fell, "Eh, what is the use of grapes? It is sour." The jackal said. So this is... Now they say there is..., that is not good for him. "Let us go to Venus. [laughter] Moon is sour." And why you spent so much money? [break] ...stone man has come. That is the museum.

**Brahmānanda:**
Stone?

**Prabhupāda:**
How from stone...

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Anthropologists.

**Prabhupāda:**
Modern stone does not produce. They have become modernized? [laughter] [break]

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
In Dvāraka, when Kṛṣṇa was here, they would have such parks?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Nice walkways?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Better than this.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Mangoes growing?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. [break] ...in a time the swan gives birth, dozen children, and there is no overpopulation. And men are killing so many children, and still, they say overpopulation? Why overpopulation? In the animal society, bird society, they do not say it is overpopulated, neither they kill. Rather, those who are bird-eaters, they will be glad, overpopulation: "We shall be able to eat them." You see. How many there are?

**Devotee:**
Seven.

**Brahmānanda:**
Nine.

**Prabhupāda:**
The mother is not concerned how to feed them. [break] ...safe under the protection... They are learning from the mother how to pick up food. [end]
