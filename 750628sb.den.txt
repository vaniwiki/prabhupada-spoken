//Kecit// means "somebody, "very rarely." "Somebody" means "very rarely." It is not so easy thing to become //vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ.// Yesterday I explained that Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa, says that //yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ. Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. //Siddhi// means perfection of life. Generally they take it //aṣṭa-siddhi// of //yoga// practice---//aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti, siddhi, īśitva, vaśitva, prākāmya.// So these are called //siddhis, yoga-siddhi. Yoga-siddhi// means you can become smaller than the smallest. Our actually magnitude is very, very small. So by //yoga-siddhi,// in spite of having this material body, one //yogī// can come to the smallest size, and anywhere you keep him packed, he will come out. That is called //aṇimā-siddhi.// Similarly, there is //mahimā-siddhi, laghima-siddhi.// He can become lighter than the swab of cotton. The //yogīs,// they become so light. Still there are //yogīs// in India. Of course, in our childhood we saw some //yogī,// he used to come to my father. So he said that he could go anywhere within very few seconds. And sometimes they go early in the morning to Jagannātha Purī, to Rāmeśvaram, to Haridwar, and take their bathing in different Ganges water and others. That is called //laghima-siddhi.// He become very light. He used to say that "We are sitting with our //guru,// and just touching. We are sitting here, and after few seconds we see in a different place." This is called //laghima-siddhi.//

So there are many //yoga-siddhis.// People become very much puzzled by seeing these //yoga-siddhi.// But Kṛṣṇa says, //yatatām api siddhānām:// "Amongst many such //siddhas// who have got //yoga-siddhi,//" //yatatām api siddhānām kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]], "somebody may understand Me." So one may achieve some //yoga-siddhis;// still, it is not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Kṛṣṇa can be understood only such persons who has dedicated everything to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa wants that, demands, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam śaraṇaṁ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Kṛṣṇa is only understandable by His pure devotee, not anyone else.

> athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-
> prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi
> jānāti tattvaṁ...
> na cānya eko 'pi ciraṁ vicinvan
> [SB 10.14.29].

Those who are favored by the causeless mercy of Kṛṣṇa, they can understand Kṛṣṇa. Others, //na cānya eko 'pi ciram vicinvan. Ciram// means for long time, for many years, if they speculate only what is God or what is Kṛṣṇa... That process will not help us. There are many Vedic version like that:

> ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi
> na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ
> sevonmukhe hi jihvādau
> svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]

Kṛṣṇa, His name, His fame, His attributes, His activities... //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved... Nāmādi// means "beginning from the holy name." So not possible... So if we keep ourself on the material platform, then for thousand years we may chant, it will be difficult. That is called //nāmāparadha.// Of course, holy name is so powerful that even by chanting with offense, gradually he becomes pure. Therefore we should not give up chanting. Any circumstances, we should go on chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// But the warning is that if we keep us on the material platform, then it will be not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa, His holy name, His attribute, His form, His activities. It will be not possible.

So the process is //bhakti.// And when you come to the platform of understanding Kṛṣṇa, then immediately you become fit for being transferred to the spiritual world. That is... Kṛṣṇa says also in the //Bhagavad-gītā, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. So then first of all people do not understand what is the aim of life. They do not care at the present moment. They have no distinction what is sinful life or what is pious life. But we may, what is called, not believe in these things, but things are there like that. Just like if you infect some disease, it will come out. You believe or not believe, it doesn't matter. Here is our doctor //sāhīb.// He knows that if you have infected some disease, it will come out. So we are infecting so many infectious qualities. There are three qualities---//sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa//---and according to our infection, we have to accept a different type of body. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. Every one of us, we are working under the modes of material nature, and according to our association we will have to accept a certain type of body, //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. Unfortunately, there is no science, there is no college, there is no university to learn this science of nature, how things are going on. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. //Prakṛti// is being there.

So we are in this material world on account of this infectious condition. This is our problem. And we have to die. That's a fact. If you say that "I don't believe in death," that is not excuse. Death must be there. You must die. So in this way our life is going on. So in the human form of life we can rectify this. This is the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that if we rectify our constant association with different material modes of nature... And as the result of this association, we are accepting one body and again dying, and again accepting another body, again dying. This business will be stopped. //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. Somehow or other, if you become fit to go back to home, back to Godhead, //yad gatvā,// then you haven't got to come back again.

But they do not understand that this material conditional life is always miserable. They have accepted, "It is very nice." Animals. Animals... Just like in the slaughterhouse, livestock godown, there are so many animals, and they are going to be slaughtered. Everyone knows. They also know, the animals. But on account of their animal quality, they cannot do anything. Similarly, we are also put into the slaughterhouse of this material world. It is called //mṛtyu-loka.// Everyone knows that he will be slaughtered. Today or tomorrow or fifty years after or a hundred years after, everyone knows that he will be slaughtered. He will die. Death means slaughter. Nobody wants to die. The animal also do not like to die, but they are forcibly killed. This is called slaughter. Similarly, who wants to die? Nobody wants to die. But by nature's law he has to be killed. That is slaughterhouse. The whole material world is slaughterhouse. We have to realize that. And it is called //mṛtyu-loka.// This is the problem. But they do not take it very seriously, like animals. The animal, he does not take very seriously. And even if he knows he will die, he cannot take any step.

So our position is like that: //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-sāgarāt. Teṣām ahaṁ anukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ. Teṣām ahaṁ samuddhartā mṛtyu-saṁsāra-sāgarāt// [[books:bg:12:6-7|[Bg. 12.7]]]. So we should understand our position. Nobody wants to die, but he is slaughtered. Again he is given another chance, another body. Again he is slaughtered. This is the laws of nature, going on. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. We should seriously understand this, that how to stop this slaughtering process of material nature. That is intelligence. Otherwise, to become happy like cats and dogs, "Oh, I am very nicely eating and jumping. I don't care for being slaughtered," that is not very good intelligence. Intelligence is how to stop this slaughtering process of nature. That is intelligence. That is being discussed.

So anyone can get out of the slaughtering process by devotional service. That is stated here, //kecit kevalayā bhaktyā. Kecit.// That is not very common. Very rarely one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Kecit kevalayā bhaktyā.// Simply by devotional service, one can get out of this dangerous condition of being slaughtered. //Kecit kevalayā bhaktyā.// And who are they? //Vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ,// devotees of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's name is Vāsudeva. He is son of Vasudeva; therefore His name is Vāsudeva. So //vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ. Parāyaṇāḥ// means "Our ultimate goal is Vāsudeva, nothing more." They are called //vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ. Vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ, aghaṁ dhunvanti. Agham// means the material contamination. We are always associating with material contamination. So if we become //vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ... Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]], the same thing. Here it says //kecit//---means very rarely. And Kṛṣṇa also says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ. Sudurlabhaḥ,// "very rare."

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, although it is very rare, we are trying to deliver Kṛṣṇa and love of Kṛṣṇa. So this is the topmost welfare activities to the human society, because it is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa, and we, under certain process, we are delivering Kṛṣṇa, and it is being effective. The process is so nice. Even the Europeans and Americans, they did not know what is Kṛṣṇa five, six years ago. But they are now very serious. Even one priest in Boston, he was astonished that "These boys, Christian boys or the Jewish boys, they are our men, and they did not care to know what is God, what is... Now they are after God; they are mad. How it is?" There are many practical proof. Just like in our many temples. Los Angeles temple, it was sold by the church because nobody was coming. Nobody was coming. We have many churches purchased in that way. Now you will see in Los Angeles it is always packed up. So we did not bring all these men from India. The men are the local men, and the church is the same church. Why they are coming? Why they are taking interest? So this is the effect of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mercy. He is personally being merciful. He is distributing, Kṛṣṇa Himself. Therefore so quickly. So if we keep ourself in the right way of executing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it will be possible---even in this very life we shall be perfect. Perfection means //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. This body, this material body, we have to give up. Everyone knows. But those who are not becoming perfect, they will have to come back again to accept another body. But those who are developed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, this is the final giving up material body, go back to home, back to Godhead. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And try to execute it very carefully, lovingly. Then your life is successful. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]].

So one who becomes fit for going to the spiritual world, Kṛṣṇaloka, Vaikuṇṭhaloka, where is the question of his sinful reaction? //Aghaṁ dhunvanti.// No sinful man can go back to home, back to Godhead. So if one is actually, somehow or other, becomes fit for going back to home, back..., that means automatically his sinful reaction of life... One may question how it is. If a man is sinful for many, many lives, how simply by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious he becomes free from the reaction? Yes. Kṛṣṇa says. You haven't got to take proof from anyone else. Kṛṣṇa says,

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi...
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

Kṛṣṇa says, "I shall give you release from all sinful reaction which you have committed for many, many births." Kṛṣṇa says. //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ.// There is no question of worrying about it, that "Oh, I have committed." But the thing is that after surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, don't commit any more sinful life. Then you are perfect. Whatever you have done is done. It doesn't matter. But after surrendering, if you think, "It is a good business. I have surrendered," no, that is not surrender. Surrender is that //sarva-dharmān parityajya.// He has no other business. That is surrender. You cannot become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa and engage in sinful activities. Then it is not surrender. You want to do your business on the strength of Kṛṣṇa's blessing---no. That is not allowed. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya.// All kinds of activities, occupational duty, you should give up. Simply be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.

Kṛṣṇa's service... Just like Arjuna. Arjuna, in the beginning he was hesitating to be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. Kṛṣṇa wanted him to fight, to take part in the fight. But he was hesitating. But when he was instructed //Bhagavad-gītā,// he understood, he decided, "Yes," //kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]], "I shall fight." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We have got many programs according to our mental concoction. That will not help us. If we simply act as Kṛṣṇa desires, then our life is perfect. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. This is //bhakti. Bhakti// means //ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanam.// You have to cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness as it pleases Kṛṣṇa, not whimsically. //Ānukūlyena.// Just like Arjuna got orders directly from Kṛṣṇa. One may argue that "Where is Kṛṣṇa?" No, you have got Kṛṣṇa's representative, //guru. Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo.// The representative is there. If you act according to his instruction, if you want to please him, then Kṛṣṇa is pleased. Just like in office the managing director or the proprietor is not in contact. Of course, Kṛṣṇa is in contact with everyone: //īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. But even taking this crude example, still, the office superintendent, if he recommends somebody, some clerk, that "This man is working very nice," that is accepted by the managing director. There is no difficulty. Therefore, //yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo:// if you want to please Kṛṣṇa, you please Kṛṣṇa's representative. //Śrī-guru-caraṇe rati, sei se uttama-gati.// We are singing daily. So Kṛṣṇa is not absent. Kṛṣṇa is already within you, but He manifests Himself as //guru, prakāśa.// This is stated in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//

So things are very easily performed if we follow the system of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And we should; we must. It is not that optional. If you make it optional, you will suffer. That is the Vedic injunction. Kṛṣṇa also says, //mām eva ya prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti.// You have to surrender to Kṛṣṇa or become... Otherwise, you will suffer by this material energy. That you cannot avoid. So every one of us, at least those who have taken Kṛṣṇa consciousness as their life and soul, they should execute devotional service very sincerely. Then their success is assured.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
