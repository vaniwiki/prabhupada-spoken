[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...yes, very nice. When //maṅgala-ārati// takes place?

**Brahmānanda:**
Four-thirty.

**Devotee:**
Four-thirty.

**Prabhupāda:**
Four-thirty. [//japa//] [break] Coca-Cola is fifty cent?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, that's a very big glass of Coca-Cola.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. In India also, it is huge consumption.

[break] ...devotee here?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Collecting flower?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
There are more.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Nobody says anything?

**Brahmānanda:**
No one is up at this time of the day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sometimes they fire. You know that?

**Satsvarūpa:**
If they see us, they don't like that. That is not such a safe practice, to go in the neighborhood and pick flowers. I don't think they should do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
[//japa//] [break] ...first came to America, Butler, one quarter is exactly like this. You have been in Butler?

**Brahmānanda:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Like this.

**Brahmānanda:**
I noticed that one review of your books was written by Mohanlal Sharma of Slippery Rock College. He wrote a very enthusiastic review.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. He claimed to be the first one to receive you at a college.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He is very nice gentleman. He came to see me in New York also, with his family.

**Brahmānanda:**
His wife is Sally?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Brahmānanda:**
That's another girl.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is Gopal. He came to learn electrical engineering.

**Brahmānanda:**
Gopal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. His father is rich man. His father came to see me, yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
From Mathurā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mathurā, yes. His father, mother... That Sally used to say, "My husband is a lost child of their parents." He is not doing very well. He is getting $800. At that time, maybe $1,000. What is here, eight hundred, thousand dollars? He could have lived very comfortably at his father's care. He is very rich man.

[break] [on walk]

Thing is that people are working so hard day and night for these temporary years, and less than that, laboring, they can go to back to home, back to Godhead. Little labor. But they do not know. Kṛṣṇa says, //yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ, bhūtejyā yānti bhū..., mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]. Just to get a nice car, a nice wife and a few children by working so hard, //bhūtejya,// and the same labor, //mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām,// if he devotes for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he goes back to home, back to Godhead. And what is wrong there? We have got so many Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees. What is wrong there than these ordinary //karmīs?// Hmm? Are we unhappy? What do you think?

**Brahmatīrtha:**
No. Nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
See? Just see the foolish people. They are working so hard for nothing. Everything will be finished after this death, and he will become a cat and dog or a tree. You see? [break] ...sometimes advocate the materialists.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Sometimes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, even we explain that, and they can seem to understand, still they won't do anything about it.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you have to constantly poke them, these rascals. Just like one man is sleeping. You have to call him constantly, "Mr. Such, Mr. Such, wake up, rascal. You are sleeping. Why?" This is our business. //Uttiṣṭhata jagrata prāpya varan nibodhata.// That is sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. //Kota nidrā jāo māyā-pīśācira kole:// "How long you will sleep? You have got this opportunity, human form of life. Now get up." //Jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo, gauracānda bole.// This is our //mantra:// "You rascal, get up. Take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness and solve all your problems."

**Satsvarūpa:**
Some people say that if we want to do this, it's all right, but we shouldn't insist and go and preach to them. Everyone has his own way.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because you are human being, you rascal, you animal, you are sleeping; we are just trying to awaken you, because you are human being. Suppose a boy, a child, is going this side. We are human being. We shall say, "No, no, you go right"? Shall you say that? We shall try to save, "Oh, what you are doing?" That is our business. That is every human being's business, to do good to others. That is human life. That is the mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]. That is human life.

**Brahmānanda:**
Actually, according to law, if someone is in trouble, if he is being attacked by someone, and someone sees this and does not do anything to help him, he can be prosecuted.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
It is his obligation to help someone in trouble.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is humanity. Not that "This man is going to hell. Let him go to hell. I am happy. That's all." That is not humanity. //Paropakāra.// That is Vedic civilization, //paropakāra,// not to exploit others.

**Siddhānta:**
A lot of times, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they say that we are just escaping material life. Not going to work, not having jobs...

**Prabhupāda:**
How we are escaping?

**Siddhānta:**
A lot of times they say that we don't have jobs and that we should work for...

**Prabhupāda:**
So why shall I... A rich man, does he work? We are rich men. We don't work. You rascal, you have no money; you work. We are rich men. Why shall I work? Any rich man you see, he is not working. He is escaping? What is that? Any rich man who has got money, he is not working. He is engaging all fools and rascals in the factory. So is that..., is he escaping?

**Siddhānta:**
A lot of times they say that we're just...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, first of all take one answer: that we are rich men, we are Kṛṣṇa's son. So why shall I work like you, an ass? A ass will work unnecessarily. We are not asses.

**Yadubara:**
Actually, we're more active than ever before.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We are rich man's son, Kṛṣṇa's son. Why shall I work? That is the nature. A rich man's son never works. He enjoys. We are dancing and taking nice //prasādam.// Why shall I work? What do you think? Poor man will work. Rich man, why they will work? He will enjoy. Kṛṣṇa says, //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. He is the proprietor of all planets, and we are servants of Kṛṣṇa, a rich man's servant. Why shall I work so hard? The ass will work hard, not a human being. And that is the instruction of Rsabhādeva. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]].

This human life is not meant for working so hard simply for food and sex enjoyment. That is the business of the hogs. The hogs do like that. They work day and night to find out some stool, and as soon as a little strength, he enjoys sex without discrimination---mother, sister, anybody. Is that life? Tell them, "You are working like hogs, and we are living like human being. That is the difference." If somebody does not work like hog, does it mean he is escaping? [laughter] Just see. And the hog is asking to work like hog. Why human being will accept this proposal?

Marshall Theory. I was student of economics. He says the human nature is, unless he has got some obligation he will not work. That is the beginning of economics. If one has got sufficient to eat, he will not work. When he is obliged to work for some reason, he works hard. That is the economic theory. So nature is... It is not escaping. If I have got sufficient to eat, why shall I work? What is the answer? This is not escaping; it is comfortable life, not to work and get everything, all necessities. That is comfort. And working hard getting the necessities, that is for the hogs and dogs, not for human being.

**Siddhānta):**
They have no faith or trust that this can be done.

**Prabhupāda:**
See us. You rascal, see. Open your eyes; see that we have no business. We have no food stocked; still, we are not worried. We do not know what we shall eat in the evening, but still, we are not worried. See factually. We are not worried, "Oh, what shall I eat?" I came here without any subsistence. That, I mean, I had to work very hard?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
I think that if the //karmīs// tried to keep up with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they would probably wear out.

**Prabhupāda:**
The //karmīs,// they work hard because they are asses. The ass example is given. Just like the picture you have seen, ass?

**Brahmānanda:**
In the movie, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
There? You see? He is loading so much, and what he is eating? Little grass. So the ass does not know, "The grass is available here. Why shall I work for him?" That is ass. He is working so hard for a few morsel of grass, and the grass is all over the world, but he will take the load. That is ass. My problem is eating, sleeping, mating, so I can arrange for these things very easily. Anywhere, I till the ground and get some food. I keep some cows and I have got land, then my whole economic question is solved. Why shall I make this //bambhārambha-bharam udvahato vimūḍhān,// big, big...? You do it, but why should you forget your real business? That is the defect, that you are so foolish that only for this maintaining body you have forgotten your real business.

**Siddhānta:**
Not everyone has the opportunity to get some land and some cows, to till the land and grow their food.

**Prabhupāda:**
No opportunity?

**Devotee (2):**
Not enough, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Not enough land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not enough? Let them come, I shall give them. So much land in America. They say "no land"? The all...

**Yadubara:**
Just like the trishaw driver. We invite him to our temple, but he says he has to work so hard. He will not come.

**Prabhupāda:**
He will go to the brothel. That he has got time. To the liquor house to forget his labor. This is civilization. //Mūḍha. Mūḍha// civilization. Why the Communists are coming? Why Communist party is there? What is the philosophy, Communist?

**Satsvarūpa:**
That wealth should be shared by everyone.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means they also do not wish to work so hard. They are seeing that "Capitalists are sitting very comfortably, and we working." They are also thinking, "Escaping." Is it not? So the natural tendency is that "I will not work, and still, I will get my necessities." That is natural tendency. The material world means //avidyā-karma-samjñānya tṛtīyā śaktir iśyate// [[books:cc:madhya:6:154|[Cc. Madhya 6.154]]]. This, out of ignorance they are working so hard. In the spiritual world there is no question of working. You get everything. //Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu// [Bs. 5.29]. Everything, whatever you want. So why not endeavor to go there? Why should you work like hogs and dogs?

**Viśakha:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, they will accuse us of being parasites.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I am not parasite. Your master. How do you say parasite? I am not going to beg from you. Parasites?

**Brahmānanda:**
Parasite lives off another.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, parasites means if I take others' property. Others'. If I enjoy others'..., that is parasite. But we are not enjoying others' property. We are enjoying our father's property. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [Īśo //mantra 1//]. Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor. Why do you say parasite? And we are good children of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, "Don't work. I shall give you everything." [laughter] Actually, Kṛṣṇa says that, that "Why you are working so hard?" //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām...// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You just under Me, I shall give you protection, whatever you want." And we are getting everything. Why parasite? //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]] [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...received in Switzerland, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that man said, "What if everyone became like you devotees?" He was worried that the economy would collapse, he said, if everyone took to this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, at least he will not take, and the economy will go on. There will be a class of men like him, they will never take. So there is no problem. Your economy will go on. [laughter] [break] "...the prisoners become free, how the prison house will go on?" Is that very nice question? What is the use of prison house? For the criminals. [break] ...are thinking in that way, that "We are giving up meat, and the slaughterhouse proprietors, they are sorry. Then how our business will go on?" As if that is a very nice business. The sooner you close that business, it is good for you. But he is thinking, "How my business will go on? If all these people give up meat-eating, then how this slaughterhouse will go on?" That is his logic. And our logic is the sooner you close this slaughterhouse, the better for you. This is our logic. Hare, Kṛ... [to devotee:] Which way? [break] ...liquor shop, the breweries, they are worried, "How business will go on? They are giving up." Cigarette factory. They will be sorry.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
In this state of Colorado, the main industry is slaughter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
The main industry in this state of Colorado is the slaughter of cows. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...jīva mā mara.// The slaughterhouse maintainer is advised that "You don't die, don't live." //Mā jīva mā mara.// "Your position... Now you are... If you live, just see how horrible business you are doing. And if you die, you will be slaughtered. So better you don't die, don't live." //Mā jīva mā mara.// [break] ...nice park, nobody is coming. We Kṛṣṇa conscious people, we are taking advantage. [laughter] They have worked so hard; they are sleeping. We are taking advantage. So they are escaping or we are escaping? Just see how foolish they are. They have worked so hard, and they are not taking advantage---we are taking. So our policy is that "You work hard, and we go and take from you." This is not escaping; this is intelligence, that "You work hard, rascal. You are foolish asses. And we take advantage." Our George Harrison, he is working hard, [indistinct]. And he worked hard, and he gives a house, Bhaktivedanta Manor. We are not going to construct. Is that escaping, or it is intelligence, that "You work hard and give it to me. We enjoy"? This is intelligence; that is not escaping. That is going on. The capitalists, they are engaging these rascals, asses, in the factory, and he's enjoying life. That is intelligence. That is not escaping.

You know the story of the stag and the jackal? [chuckles] The jackal fell in the well water. So he was not..., unable to come out. So one stag came there. "What is the...?" "Oh, it is so nice. I am dancing. You see? It is very nice." So he also fell down. And as soon as he fell down, he got on his head and got out. So that is intelligence, that "Let this rascal work hard and make a nice park for us, and we shall take advantage of it." This is intelligence. And it is called //ajāgara-vṛtti. Ajāgara-vṛtti. Ajāgara// means... The big snake is called //ajāgara.// So this mouse, they make hole and want to live there. And they comfortably living. In the meantime, the //ajāgara// comes. He eats that mouse and lives comfortably. So our is //ajāgara vṛtti.// You work for the hole to live comfortably, but we take possession of the house and live comfortably. [break] ...Los Angeles, the storekeepers, they ask our men that "You do not work. You live so comfortably. And working so hard, we cannot live so comfortably." And as soon as we ask that "You also come and join," they will not: "No, we shall work like this." We are asking everyone, "Come here," but that will not come. And that is, they are envious. Therefore they say escaping, that "They are living at the cost of others so comfortably." That is their enviousness. They see, "They have got so many cars, their face is bright, they are eating nicely, and they have no problem." So they are envious.

**Harikeśa:**
They would do it immediately if they knew how.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Harikeśa:**
If they knew how, they would also do it immediately.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we are inviting them, "Come here." Why do they not come? And that is difficult for them. To chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance, oh, it is very big, heavy task for them. They will not come. The most difficult thing is that as soon as they come and they know there is no tea, no liquor, no meat, no cigarette, "Oh, so many no's? Oh." That draft man said? That one draft man came to inquire that some of the boys, to escape from the draft man's call, they joined this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. "So what is the comfort there? They joined instead of going to..." So when he studied that there is no meat, there is no liquor, there is no smoking, there is no gambling, so he said, "It is more difficult. Still, they come." It is more difficult than to go and fight. So how it is wonderful. Actually, for the //karmīs// it is very difficult job. Even Lord Zetland, he said, "Oh, it is impossible to do this." And actually, it is impossible. That is the adoration of Dr..., Professor Judah, that "These drug-addicted boys, how they have become Kṛṣṇa conscious?" That is his wonderful thing. You can say that "We are escaping this horrible condition of life: meat-eating, drinking and intoxication. We are escaping that, these thing, not escaping happiness. You are escaping happiness." //Harer nāma harer nāma...//

**Satsvarūpa:**
The psychologist says that the real responsibility is to enjoy sex life, and that, in that way, we are...

**Prabhupāda:**
But that hog also enjoys. Then where is the difference between you and hog? The hog enjoys unrestrictedly. The cats and dogs also enjoy. So what is the benefit of becoming human being, civilized man? That enjoyment is there in the hog's life in a better way. You have got some discrimination, "Here is my sister, here is my mother, here is my daughter," but there is no such distinction. You enjoy life and become a hog, and that is waiting for you, next life. There is no law of raping amongst the hogs and dogs. They can capture any female. But in the human society why there is restriction? So hogs and dogs are better enjoying sex life. You become hog and dog. Why civilized man?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
When we tell them that, they think, "Oh, that's very nice."

**Prabhupāda:**
You are waiting for getting that life. Wait a few years more. You will get that life. Yes.

**Brahmatīrtha:**
One scientist recently did a study on mosquitoes. They found out that all mosquitoes do is have sex and eat. And he was lamenting. He said, "Oh, these mosquitoes..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Sex and eat.

**Brahmatīrtha:**
That's all they do. He said... He was amazed that they have so much sex life, mosquitoes. So then the scientist, he was lamenting. He was thinking, "Oh, these mosquitoes, they probably do not enjoy the sex life." And he sounded as if he wished he was a mosquito to find out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, mosquito, flies, I have seen. Even the sparrows. Sex life is the center of happiness in this material world, in all forms of life. That is the only.

**Brahmānanda:**
They think that sex life for humans is the best, is the better sex life; that the animals, they really don't know how to enjoy.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another foolishness. If you take some palatable thing in different pot, does it mean the taste changes? You take some juice in the golden pot or iron pot. Does it mean the taste of the juice is changed on account of golden pot? That is another foolishness. Taste is the same, either you drink it in golden pot or iron pot. [break]

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
//Bhāgavatam// says, "Unless a person is influenced by //māyā,// how can he do such a thing?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore we say that whatever you are doing under the influence of //māyā,// it is suffering. It is not enjoyment. [break] //Harer nāma harer nāma...// This way? [break]

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
In Kṛṣṇaloka are there asses?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, maybe. But they are not these asses. Kṛṣṇa... I don't... The cowherds boys, they are keeping only cows. I never saw any ass or goat.

**Satsvarūpa:**
They killed all those asses. They killed Dhenukāsura and all those...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. There were asses, yes. They killed. But they were //asuras,// of course. No, that means asses are there.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, I thought you said that the demons are not in Kṛṣṇaloka. That's just in Gokula, when Kṛṣṇa comes here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Kṛṣṇa wants to enjoy to kill the demons. In the Kṛṣṇaloka there is no demons. He doesn't get that opportunity. Therefore He comes down to enjoy killing. Just like hunter, by killing, enjoys, so Kṛṣṇa enjoys by killing the demons. [break] Water?

**Brahmānanda:**
Water core. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...no rose here? We don't see any rose.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
They don't like to grow nice things, for fear someone will take them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That is...

**Bahulavana:**
There's a big rose garden by the museum.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
They don't grow fruit trees in the park, because someone will eat them.

**Prabhupāda:**
And will not work. Escaping. [break] ...demonic mentality, "I shall not do anything which will be enjoyed by others." And human mentality is that "I shall do something which will be enjoyed by others." That is human mentality.

**Brahmānanda:**
In India, isn't it the system that after they harvest the wheat they leave some on the ground for the others to come and pick?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, they distribute while in the field. They give to the //brāhmaṇas,// to the temples, to the king, and the balance they take. This is the Vedic system, that if I grow something, first of all twenty-five percent to the king, then to the temple, to the //brāhmaṇas,// to the poor. And then balance, I shall take. And they produce so large quantity, they do not feel any scarcity. And when the trade came, people understood. Then they want to sell. "Why shall I give to the temple?

Why shall I give to the //brāhmaṇa?// Save it. I shall sell it. I shall get more money, and I shall drink." When trade came. When there was no trade, you grow your own food and distribute freely. In my Guru Mahārāja's time they were collecting the rice and other food grain, huge quantity. They were giving. And now they are not giving. They think that "If I sell, I shall get so much money, and it will help me for my drinking."

**Harikeśa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, what would people do who live in areas where things are not grown so easily, like in the colder areas?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why should you live there? Why don't you come where things are grown?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
This excessive cold is only punishment.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Previously there was not such excessive cold on the planet?

**Prabhupāda:**
There was, for the punishable person.

[break] ...drinking water?

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why it is open?

**Brahmānanda:**
They keep it running?

**Devotee (2):**
All the time.

**Kuruśreṣṭha:**
I guess they do. [end]
