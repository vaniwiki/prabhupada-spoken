**Devotee:**
[announces] Morning walk, Chicago, July 4th.

**Prabhupāda:**
...resembling Boston. That students' quarter?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Next. Go to the beach no. [break] Sweet water?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Bhavānanda:**
This is sweet water, yes. Fresh water. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Angeles, I have seen while going to the beach, one man has made a boat of concrete cement. Did you see? Nobody marked?

**Viṣṇujana:**
In California there are such boats, concrete boats.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are used?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Oh, yes. They are used for taking cargo up and down the coast. They don't travel in the ocean, but they travel on the coast. They used them during the Second World War all over the United States.

**Prabhupāda:**
Such boat does not drown?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Doesn't sink?

**Viṣṇujana:**
They keep it up by huge air tanks. By holding so much air they keep the cement up. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...ficial means. Otherwise it will drown.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sink, yeah. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...officially closed. [break] ...water increases? I don't think. It does not.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The lake water. Doesn't increase. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...never. [break] Dirty water?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is a boat ramp, where they let boats down. The water doesn't look very clean.

**Brahmānanda:**
There's a lot of shipping in these lakes.

**Devotee (1):**
They also pump a lot of refuse from the industry in there. I think it's polluted. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...we'll go? [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We've been reading in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Madhya-līlā,// that there's a statement that when Caitanya Mahāprabhu took //prasādam// at the house of Advaita Ācārya, there's a verse quoted from the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that a //sannyāsī// should not leave anything, no... When he's taking his meals, he should not leave anything on the plate. But sometimes we have heard in the past that a //sannyāsī// should leave something on the plate.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Sometimes the //guru// leaves some remnant to be taken by the disciple. That is meant for the disciple. Ordinarily they should not. [break] ...from the other side of the lakes?

**Brahmānanda:**
It's Canada.

**Prabhupāda:**
Canada, oh.

**Śrī Govinda:**
Actually, I think it is Michigan. It is another state in the United States. Then to the north is Canada. [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
One temple, St. Louis temple, has come to this festival, and they brought with them their installed Deities, which are Gaura-Nitāi. I wasn't sure that was right of them to do that. And They're now on the altar of the Chicago temple, but the Deities are not in the St. Louis temple. Gaura...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is closed?

**Satsvarūpa:**
They left one man there. Better to keep the temple open with the Deities there, or can the...?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. When there is Deity, it must be taken care of.

**Satsvarūpa:**
They should not be transported to another temple?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. No harm.

**Satsvarūpa:**
May the temple be only one man left?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why, if there is no Deity, what is the use of keeping one man? [break] ...is meant for Deity, not for man. [break]

**Viṣṇujana:**
...Dāmodara here for the festival. Is it all right for Them to go on Lord Jagannātha's altar while He is gone?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Is it all right to put the Deities on the altar in the temple, on Lord Jagannātha's altar, while He's gone?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...private houses or...?

**Bhavānanda:**
Some of them are university and some are private. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...the news we have got the "No Objection" certificate.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Really? For the temple or the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Bombay.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's for a skyscraper building or for the temple?

**Prabhupāda:**
Temple.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Really?

**Prabhupāda:**
The chief minister has sanctioned. He is very nice man.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Naik?

**Prabhupāda:**
No Naik. Naik was a rogue.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
A new one.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, he is... Chavan?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So now we can build two towers and a temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now bring money. [laughter]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda, what is the plan? To send money or books?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, money. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...He says a devotee is never vanquished, Prabhupāda. Just see. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...book we get so much description of the sky and planets, but they had no observatory. How it was possible? [break] ...they can see with the observatory? [laughs] [break]

**Viṣṇujana:**
...see it themselves, Prabhupāda. They don't want to just read it in books, they say.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, what they will see, that is my question, with these limited eyes?

**Satsvarūpa:**
But they say that even what they can't see, it's more of the same.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Satsvarūpa:**
They've made some conclusion by their mathematics as to what they can see. Whatever they can't see, it's still more of the same---material sky and planets. There's nothing beyond it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then seeing and not seeing, the same thing? That is, means you see or not see... Is that mean? That seeing or not seeing? This is contradictory. Either you see or you don't see. These are two things. [laughter] But what is this "I see; I don't see"?

**Viṣṇujana:**
For that, they spend millions of dollars on a telescope.

**Prabhupāda:**
And just see. That which is impossible, they are trying for that. //Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]], chewing the chewed, that's all. When your senses are imperfect, then what you will see? Whatever you see, that is imperfect. So what is the meaning of seeing? Therefore our seeing is //śāstra-cakṣuṣāt.// We should see through the authorized scriptures. That is our... You will see in the description of Śukadeva Gosvāmī of the whole universe, conclusion, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, "So far I have described as I have heard." He never says, "As I have seen." This is required. [break] ...that we believe in the creation.

And others also, just like Christians, they also believe God created. But who has seen God is creating? Who has seen? Simply hear from God. He says, "I have created." That's all. But if you challenge, "I have not seen that You have created; neither I have seen You," then how can you believe? God says, "I have created," so those who are God believers, they will accept that. So what is the use of seeing again, observatory? We trust in God, but don't trust in His word. This is going on. You write in America, "We trust in God," but don't trust in His word. [laughs] Just see. If God you trust, then whatever God says, you believe. "No, that we cannot do." This is [indistinct]. [break]

**Viṣṇujana:**
Kṛṣṇa is so opulent, why did He appear in the form of Lord Caitanya in such a poor village atmosphere?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is His opulence. Here the material man, if he is rich man, he cannot become a poor man. That means he is lacking that opulence. [break] ...opulence. //Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 1.2.20]. He can become the bigger than the biggest and the smaller than the smallest. That is opulence. You cannot manufacture a mosquito. You can manufacture a 747, but manufacture a mosquito, then we shall know your science. [laughter] ...the same machine. Otherwise how it is flying? [break] ...seen, so imperfect you are, that what are the machine there? And you are proud of seeing, nonsense. See the machine, where it is there, how the mosquito is flying.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And one mosquito can produce many mosquitoes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everything is there, complete.

**Brahmānanda:**
It doesn't crash either.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. [laughter] And still, these rascals, believing their eyes. What is the meaning of your eyes? You see, study mosquito. Not only mosquito; you will find at night I see a small insect, less than the magnitude of full stop, [makes insect sound:] "//pu-pu-pu-pu-pu-pu.//" The same machine is there. Now see what is the machine there if you have such eyes. What is their answer? "In future." Just see. In future they will be able. Yes. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...will say that nature has created such a...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then nature is greater than you. Then you are rascal. You have to accept, somebody is greater than you. He knows; you do not know. Learn from him.

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, they say that they can control nature.

**Prabhupāda:**
Again foolishness. That irritates me. When they speak like that, rascal, that irritates me. [laughter] Therefore I simply call them rascal. [break] //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇaḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. They are claiming very, very big man, but as soon as we see that he is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, we reject, "He is a foolish." That's all. [break] There is... That is a fact. One case was going on, and the judge was dozing, like that. So his clerk warned, "Sir, you are dozing. Big, big lawyers, they are talking."

"So let these rascals go on talking. I have already concluded my..., [laughter] what judgment I shall give. Let them..." [laughs] So our is like that. We don't hear these rascals. Our judgment is already there. They are rascals, that's all. Let them talk whole day and night. [laughing] The judge said to the clerk that "I have already made my judgment, so let these foolish men go on talking." [break] ...minister of Orissa, he has promised a land in Jagannātha Purī. So if we get that land, is it not possible to construct another Jagannātha temple?

**Devotees:**
//Haribol.//

**Prabhupāda:**
You'll earn the American money here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If they won't let us into that Jagannātha Purī, we have to make another one.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Jagannātha will come to our temple. Yes. [break] ...selling //prasādam,// we shall distribute free. [break] ...comes, take //prasādam.// [end]
