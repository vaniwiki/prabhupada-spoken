[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Jewish temple?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Deity or not?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, no.

**Jayatīrtha:**
No. They worship their scripture, though, the Toraḥ. They keep it on one altar and then they bring it out...

**Brahmānanda:**
Once a year.

**Jayatīrtha:**
And everyone pays respects.

**Prabhupāda:**
The scripture gives any description of God?

[break] [on walk]

**Prabhupāda:**
...religion, they have got at least.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...spoke to Gargamuni Mahārāja this morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I spoke with Gargamuni Mahārāja this morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm!

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He collected $12,000 this month.

**Prabhupāda:**
Collected.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
But I heard that he is collecting $6,000 daily.

**Brahmānanda:**
Six hundred.

**Prabhupāda:**
Six hundred, oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He collected twelve thousand. But his party is increasing in size.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, he can organize. [laughs] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...Philadelphia to see you at the Ratha-yātrā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] When important talks will be, I shall say. You can record. [end]
