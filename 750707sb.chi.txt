//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] Sixth Canto, First Chapter, verse number 23. [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

[02:33]

"My dear King, Ajāmila, while maintaining his large family of many sons by abominable activities, passed eighty-eight years of his life."

**Prabhupāda:**

> evaṁ nivasatas tasya
> lālayānasya tat-sutān
> kālo 'tyagān mahān rājann
> aṣṭāśītyāyuṣaḥ samāḥ
> [[books:sb:6:1:23|[SB 6.1.23]]]

So his living condition was cheating and stealing and forcing others to snatch away some money. This was his living condition. So he was thinking, "I am very happy. I am begetting children," //lālayānasya tat-sutān.// Every year, one children, and getting money by cheating others, and living very peacefully. But the time factor was waiting, according to one's duration of life. So when //aṣṭāśīti,// eighty-eight years reached, his death was imminent. //Kāla. Kāla// means death. So he did not know that time and tide waits for no man. When time will come, death, then all this my paraphernalia will be taken away. I am very proud of my wealth, prestigious position, family, society. Everything is all right. But what about your death? Do you think that any day death will come and it will take everything, what you possess?

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that //mṛtyuḥ aham sarva-haraś// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]. We are accumulating so many things---big, big buildings, big, big estate, big, big bank balance, big, big family. That's all right, but what is the guarantee that we will be able to enjoy this? That they are not thinking. And it is a fact that death may come at any moment, especially nowadays. So you... There is no guarantee. Even in your ordinary life you are going by the car, there may be accident. "Maybe" not; they are taking place. So many people are dying. He does not expect that "I am going to office. I shall be killed." In aeroplane crash... So there is no guarantee. Any moment we can die. But we are not thinking, because they have made this theory, "There is no life after death. So enjoy. Enjoy life as far as possible." But that is not the fact. After death we will have to accept another body. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. But they try to forget it. And the argument they put forward, that "Even I get one body next life, I shall forget this life. So what is the wrong? Let us enjoy." This is called life of ignorance, passion. But this is not the proper life.

So yesterday we discussed the different grades of life: first class, second class, third class, fourth class, fifth class, sixth class. So this kind of life, without any responsibility, and carried away by the waves of time, is the tenth-class life. This is tenth-class life, ignorance. So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, he sings one song, //miche māyār bośe, jāccho bhese', khāccho hābuḍubu bhāi:// "By the waves of //māyā// you are being carried away, and //hābuḍubu,// sometimes being drowned within the, under the water, and sometimes rising, floating on the water." This is our life, material life. We are being carried away by the waves of nature. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. And sometimes... Just like in the waves of water you will find many straws and vegetables and leaves, they gather together. You will find. And again, by another toss, they are separated. One straw goes this way, another straw, leaf, goes this way, no combination. Similarly we are gathering together: society, friendship, love, community, society, and so on, so on, nationality, family, sons, daughters, wife. The same thing: the waves of water gathering together the straws, leaves and other, and another wave, finished. All society, friendship, love, children, wife, everything, national---finished. This is going on. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]].

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //bhūtvā. Bhūtvā// means taking shape in some particular type of body. The living soul is there within this body, but the outward dress... Just like we are sitting, so many persons---we have got different dresses---similarly, all these 8,400,000's different forms of life, they are coming into existence and again changing. This is called material world. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. But we are hearing from authorities like Lord Kṛṣṇa. He says, //na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit:// "My dear Arjuna, a living entity does not take birth. There is no birth, death, old age, disease of the spirit soul." //Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācin nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. That is understanding, that we, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// we, all of us, we are particle of Brahman; therefore we are eternal. There is no birth, death, old age and disease. So actually, we do not like to die. Why? Because I am eternal, you are eternal, so I want to live forever. But we are put under certain condition of this material world that we have to die.

Die means in this body we are creating some situation for the next life, and in order to accept... Just like one person---especially this Ajāmila //upākhyāna//---his ways of life was not ordinary; most abominable. So abominable, good or bad, in this life we are creating some situation so that we will get next life another body. Therefore there is death. That is material world. And as soon as there is death, there is birth. Death means we enter into the womb of a mother for, say, ten months. That ten months is considered as death. Not ten months, because the child within the womb of the mother returns his consciousness when the child is seven months old. This is human body. At that time he feels inconvenience within the womb of mother. Before that, he is unconscious, sleeping. Now, when the body grows within the mother's womb and it is seven months, then he returns consciousness. He feels inconvenient. And he is very eager to come out. Those who are advanced, they pray to God, "My Lord, somehow or other get me release from this condition. This life I shall devote for rendering You service so that I may be free from this condition." So similarly, at ten months, ten days, he comes out and..., but forgets. //Svajanera kole.// Many relatives, mother, father, takes care, and he forgets that "I promised I shall become Kṛṣṇa conscious this time." But on account of illusory energy, he thought that "I am very comfortably situated. My father is taking care. My mother is taking care. My relatives are taking care. So very happy life." This is called forgetfulness.

So Śukadeva Gosvāmī, therefore, he remained within the womb of his mother for sixteen years. And as soon as he got out from the mother's womb, immediately he left home. You will read in //Bhāgavatam.// So father was going after. After all, father, that this boy, going out, "My dear son, come back. Where you are going? Where you are going?" He didn't care. He didn't care. He went away. There are persons like that. They don't want to be attached to this material affection. //Māyāra vaibhava// [//Vidyāra Vilāse// 3]. These are expansion of the illusory energy. That is sense. That is first-class understanding. Actually, there is no need of this material world. Just like somebody says that "If all the prisoners are become free, how the prison house will go on?" And is it a very good proposal? The prison house, as soon as it is stopped, as soon as it is closed, that is good for the society. Why there should be prison house at all? But they want to maintain the prison house, and very anxious, "If people all are set free, then who will fill up this prison house?" They question that, that "If all people go to back to home, back to Godhead, then how this world will go on?" [laughter] That is their anxiety. But we say the sooner you close this business and all of you go back to home, back to Godhead, then everything is very nice.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya! Jaya,// Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So //kāla,// as it is said. //Kālaḥ atyagāt mahān. Mahān// means very powerful, great. You may be very big scientist and very powerful politician, don't care for anything, but you cannot conquer over the //mahān,// the great, powerful time. Oh, that is not possible. You are independent. You don't care for God. But God will come. You will see. //Kālo 'smi.// When Kṛṣṇa showed the gigantic form, //virāḍ-mūrti,// so Arjuna enquired, "Who are You, Sir?" Because he was dealing with Kṛṣṇa as friend, but after seeing the //virāḍ-rūpa,// the gigantic universal form, so he enquired, "Who are You, Sir?" He replied, //kālo 'smi:// "I am //kāla, kāla.// I have appeared to take away all these sinful demons." So Kṛṣṇa appears still in form of war, big gigantic war, and takes away so many millions of people by one stroke. This is going on. So we should have sense that "We hear from the //śāstras// that we are eternal. Why we are subjugated to these laws of nature, //kāla?// I do not wish to die, I do not wish to suffer, I do not wish to be old man, I do not wish to be diseased, and these things are forced upon me. I have to accept, and still, I am so fool, I am thinking I am independent." Just see. This is called foolishness, rascaldom.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to remove this rascaldom, foolishness. That is the purpose of this movement, that "Sir, you are not independent. You are completely under the grip of material nature, and after death, your all independence finished. You are under the control of material nature, and you have to accept, a type of body will be forced upon you." //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur deha upapattaye// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. So how the next body is formed? //Karmaṇā,// by your activities. You are forming your next body. You are responsible for your next body. Therefore you should not become a tenth-class man like Ajāmila.

Of course, Ajāmila is better than anyone. That will come. But we are creating this tenth class... No. Everyone has the chance to become first-class man and come to the understanding, the value of life, and mold our life so that we can, next life, we can get better chance. The so-called Darwin's evolutionary theory... Some way or other, he brings to the human body, but he has not discussed what is after human body. He has avoided. But after this, that depends on your work. Because your consciousness is developed than the animal, than the cats and dogs, and the //śāstra// is giving you information how you can get the other body, next body. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// you will find,

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtejyā yānti bhūtāni
> mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

Now make your choice. There are different planets. These rascals say that only living entities are in this planet, and all planets are vacant. Just see their scientific knowledge. What the other planets have done? It is made of the same ingredient, five elements, earth, water, air, fire, and we find innumerable living entities within this planet, and why other planets made of the same ingredient and there is vacant? Why? This is not scientific knowledge. The other planets are also filled up with living entities, even in the sun planet. We cannot think, "The sun planet is made of fire. How living entities can live there?" Yes. Why not? You have to little consider about your rascal senses.

What is the fault in the sun planet that there shall be no life? The five elements means earth, water, fire, air, ether. So fire is as good as the earth, one of the elements. Earth, water, fire, air, ether or sky. So we are experiencing that on earth, on the land, there are so many lives. And in the water there are so many lives. In the air there are so many lives. And why not in the fire? What is the reason? You have got some concocted ideas that in fire, nobody can live there. But //Bhagavad-gītā// says, "No, you can live there." There is a verse---I now forget---that "Fire cannot burn it." Can anyone recite that verse?

**Nitāi:**
//Adāhyo 'yam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Adāhyo 'yam. Adāhyo 'yam.// This is the nature of the soul, //adāhya. Aśoṣyo 'yam, aśoṣyo 'yam.// The..., that is the distinction between the soul and the matter. Matter, any matter you take, earth, earthly matter, even the hardest matter, namely the iron, it can be melted, it can be burned. But the soul is distinct from this matter. Therefore it is described, //adāhyo 'yam.// Any material thing can be dried up by the air. But soul, //aśoṣyo 'yam:// "It is not dried up." Any material thing can be moistened. So the soul cannot be. In this way every particular there is. So in the fire the soul cannot be //adāhyo 'yam,// it cannot be burned. And we get information, as there are worms in everything---earth, water, fire... In the fire there are worms. They are called //agni-po//[?]. Where is the scientist? But we get this information from the //śāstra: agni-po,// worms within the fire. And Kṛṣṇa says, above all---this is also Kṛṣṇa's statement---//imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. There is kingdom. There is city. There is, I mean, population. Otherwise, how Kṛṣṇa went there long, long ago, forty millions of years, and He instructed this //Bhagavad-gītā// to the sun-god, Vivasvān? His name is also there. Not fictitious. This is the //paramparā// system. //Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam.//

So we have got picture in our //Bhagavad-gītā:// the sun-god is listening. The sun-god, there is sun-god. Just like here we have got a god, Ford or Nixon, similarly, in every planet there is a god. Therefore it is described, //yānti deva-vratā devān// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]. All these gods, they are demigods. They are not God. God is one. So //deva.// That... If you try to go to the sun planet, moon planet or any other planet, millions and trillions of planet, you can go. Higher planetary system, lower planetary system, that you can go. That is... The description is there in the //śāstras.// They are going to the moon. Of course, I have several times... They have never gone, but anyway... You can go to the moon planet. How you can go, the description is there. So moon planet is not vacant. That is counted amongst the heavenly planets. If anyone can go there, he can live there for ten thousands of years. Ten thousand of years means according to the demigods' years. Their duration and our duration is: our one day..., our six months, their one day. That is admitted by scientists that you go higher, the relative time is different. Just like when the Russians first of all sent that Sputnik, in one hour, twenty-five minutes, they surrounded all over the world. Now it is relative. You have got a speedy vehicle. So generally, the 25,000 miles, this earth, it takes long, long time, even you go by aeroplane But you have got..., when you have got a better machine, it is finished within one hour, twenty-five minutes. So as you go higher, higher, the time duration becomes different. This is called relativity. We hear from the //Bhagavad-gītā// the duration of life of Brahmā, //sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ// [[books:bg:8:17|[Bg. 8.17]]]. Our some millions of years is equal to twelve hours of Brahmā.

So in this way, if you like to go to the other, higher planetary system, there is system how to go there. As we have got system here in this world... If anyone wants to come to America, he has to arrange for visa and passport and so many things. Without going through the system, you cannot enter by force. So these foolish people are thinking that "There is no living entity. It is lying vacant, and by force we can go there." And after spending millions of dollars, we come back with some dust, that's all. [laughter] And become proud that we have gone to moon planet. So the Vedic //śāstra// does not say so. But you can go there. You can live there, a higher standard of comfortable life, higher duration of life. //Yānti deva-vratā devān// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]. You can go there. But anywhere you go within this material world, either the moon planet or sun planet or Brahmaloka, Kṛṣṇa says, //ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]. Even if you go to the Brahmaloka, that is also not permanent settlement. After many, many years, you have to come... //Kṣīṇe puṇye punaḥ martya-lokaṁ viśanti// [[books:bg:9:21|[Bg. 9.21]]]. When your resultant action of pious life will be finished, you will come back again.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that why we shall accept this material body, which is limited, maybe one hundred years or one thousand years or one hundred second or millions of...? The our advice is that take, revive your original, permanent life, eternal life, and go back to home, back to Godhead. That is our program. Don't die like Ajāmila and others. This is our program. Those who are intelligent, they will take advantage of this movement, and... //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. So take advantage of this movement intelligently. And there is no difficulty. You can see practically. We are not in any kind of difficulty. Very easily... //Susukhaṁ kartum avyayam// [[books:bg:9:2|[Bg. 9.2]]]. Those who are devotees executing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //susukham,// they are happy. //Susukhaṁ kartum...// To execute this Kṛṣṇa conscious atmosphere, //susukham,// what is that? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance and take //prasādam.// That's all. Where is the difficulty?

So our request is take advantage of this movement and push it on. Those who are in ignorance, they do not know what is the value of life, what is next life. Just enlighten them. That is a good business. Kṛṣṇa will recognize. Anyone who is pushing on this movement, he is immediately recognized. Because Kṛṣṇa wants... We are all sons of Kṛṣṇa. He wants us back to home, live with Him comfortably, without any disadvantage of conditional life. Freedom. Kṛṣṇa wants. Therefore He comes: //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. That //dharmasya glāniḥ// means... //Dharma// means religious. //Glāni// means pollution. What is that? We are manufacturing so many rascal type of religion. This is //dharmasya glāniḥ.// But real religion is as Kṛṣṇa says. What is that? //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is religion. Religion means the order of Kṛṣṇa. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. You cannot manufacture religion. Religion means you carry out the order of God. That is religion. That is religion. So you do not know what is God, what is the order of God, or even if you know, you do not carry out---then what is the meaning of your religion? It has no meaning. Therefore //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// directly takes it, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavaḥ atra paramaḥ nirmatsarāṇāṁ, vāstavaṁ vastu vedyam atra.//

So this //Bhāgavata// religion is not a cheating religion. This is real religion. Don't be carried away by cheating type of religion. You do not understand what is the value of life, what is the goal of life, how we can revive our eternal life. These things are to be known, and then your life, human life, is successful. And that chance is present before you in this form of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Take advantage of it and be happy.

Thank you very much.
