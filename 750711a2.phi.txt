**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Gurudāsa? I don't see him.

**Jayatīrtha:**
He hasn't arrived yet from the airport.

**Prabhupāda:**
When you have come?

**Bhūgarbha:**
I have come about two and a half weeks ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bhūgarbha:**
About two and a half weeks ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
So thank you very much for your kind reception. The press reporter, they were asking me that we make distinction between man, woman, and black, white. We make distinction not in that way. We say that so long you are on the material platform, artificially, however you may try to keep everyone on the equal level, it will be failure. Just like the United Nation is trying to be united nationally, internationally for the last more than thirty years, but they have not been able to do so. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// there is one verse,

> vidyā-vinaya-sampanne
> brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
> śuni caiva śva-pāke ca
> paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]

//Paṇḍita// means spiritually advanced. A person who is spiritually advanced, he sees on equal level a very learned man, //vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇa, brāhmaṇa,// the first-class man; //vidyā-vinaya-sampanne gavi,// an animal like cow; //hasti,// animal like elephant; //vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini, śuni,// means dog; //śva-pāka,// means the dog-eater, //caṇḍāla//---all of them, they see equal. So what is that seeing? If I invite one learned scholar, and if I ask him, "Please sit down with the dog," will he be pleased? He will feel insulted. But I see that within the dog there is spirit soul, and within the learned scholar there is spirit soul. //Paṇḍitāḥ sama... Sama-darśinaḥ// means from different platform. On the material platform, if I say, "Oh, you may be a learned scholar, and you may think the dog is dog, but I see you are all equal," so it will be insult.

So the fact is that we cannot disturb the equality, er, different position materially; at the same time, we have to understand what is the position spiritual. That is wanted. If we make distinction between man and woman, black and white, then how in our temple we are enjoying together? Because we... Actually, we are equal on the spiritual platform. We do not say that "You are woman. You cannot become my disciple," or "You are black; therefore you cannot become my disciple." No. We welcome everyone. So they may not misunderstand. Just you can issue one statement that "We say that if you want to see everyone equally, treat everyone equally, then you have to come to the spiritual platform, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Materially, it is not possible."

So in the //Bhagavad-gītā// you will find different statement by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In one place He says that //vidyā-vindaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini.// In another place Kṛṣṇa says, //strīṣu duṣṭāsu vārṣṇeya..., varṇa-saṅkaraḥ abhibhavāte// [[books:bg:1:40|[Bg. 1.40]]]. No, //strīṣu dustasu:// "When woman becomes polluted, then there is unwanted population." So if in one place it is stated that //paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ,// man and woman is equal, or //paṇḍita,// or learned, dog and //brāhmaṇa.// In another place He says, //strīṣu duṣṭāsu vārṣṇeya.// So the fact is that in order to make progress towards the end of spiritual realization that we must make distinction, but the aim should be one. If you artificially do not make distinction, that will not stay. Just like in your country the black and white, they have got equal rights, but why they fight sometimes, racial fight? Because it is on the material platform.

So our point is that you come to the spiritual platform, then this equality will be possible. If you keep yourself on the material platform, then artificially you may say, "We are equal," but at last we shall fight. This is our proposition. Therefore we request everyone that you come to the spiritual platform, then everything will be very nice. There will be no distinction, because //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā.// When one was spiritually realized, then he becomes happy. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. There is no more lamentation. There is no more hankering. Just like one man is trying to become another man's position. That is hankering. So in spiritual platform there is no hankering, because he understands that spiritually we are one.

So how that spiritually oneness can be made possible, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We are trying to solve all problems by this one stroke, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Practically, you can see. Here, while you are chanting, dancing, the boy is dancing, the father is dancing, the black is dancing, the white is dancing, the young is dancing, the old is dancing. You can see practically. The woman is dancing. A man is dancing. So dancing everyone. They are not artificially dancing like dog, but by spiritual ecstasy. That is the dancing platform. They are not dancing here for some monetary purpose. No. It is automatic, automatic, realizing God, in relationship with God. Even it is not realized... It is realized, but even if you say that they are not realized, but they are feeling ecstasy, that "We are all servant of Kṛṣṇa." That is wanted.

So despite artificial distinction... Just like a man's body and a female's body, woman's body, the bodily structure is different. How you can say they are equal? No. When you see the external structure of the body of man and woman, there is difference. But despite this difference, when the man and woman think in connection with Kṛṣṇa, they are equal. That is wanted. Our proposition is that artificially you do not try to make equality. That will be failure. It is already failure. Now how you can...? Just like I have seen in London, woman police. So woman police, so I was joking with her, "If I capture your hand and snatch you, what you will do? You are policeman. [laughter] You will cry simply. So what is the use of your becoming policeman?"

Policeman requires bodily strength. If there is some hooligan, you can give him one slap or catch him, but what the woman will do? So we say that be practical. Artificial equality will not endure. We are equal, undoubtedly, because we are all spirit souls. //Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prā...// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. //Asmin dehe,// within this body, there is the spirit soul. That we have to understand first of all. And then, if we cultivate on that platform of spirit soul, then we shall feel equal and there will be no disturbance. Everyone will be peaceful. That is wanted. We are stressing that point, that artificially if you say that "We are all equal," it will not act. But spiritually when you understand equality, that will continue, and that will bring peace and happiness all over the human society.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya...// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
If you have any question? [break] ...statement. Distinction is already there. That I explained today. But we are trying to go above the distinction. But when I say that distinction is already there, they misunderstand that I am making distinction. I am not making distinction. They are already there. Why a woman is differently dressed and a man is differently dressed? Why the structure of the body, woman, is different from the man? Why there is no equal right---I was yesterday talking---that woman also become pregnant and man also become pregnant? [chuckles]

That distinction is there by nature. But if you come to the spiritual platform, then you will understand that "I am not this body. These distinction are on the bodily platform. I am spirit soul. My function is how to serve God." Then it is equality. It is clear thing. But because they do not understand that there is distinction between spirit and matter---they amalgamate or they have no brain that spirit is different from matter---therefore they think that I am making distinction. No. So we should understand the real position, and then automatically there will be equality, there will be no misunderstanding. Yes?

**Devotee:**
What is the best way to deal with skepticism?

**Brahmānanda:**
What is the best way to deal with skepticism?

**Prabhupāda:**
Skepticism---rascalism. [laughter] We are not going to deal with rascalism. We are going to deal with sense. Skepticism means they do not believe in anything. Everything is false. They are so disappointed, they think everything is false. We are not going to deal with such men. What is the use? Is not that skepticism? What is that skepticism?

**Devotee:**
Disappointment.

**Brahmānanda:**
That's all.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why one should be disappointed? We say that "You come to the spiritual platform. You will be happy." We want to deliver him from the platform of disappointment. Sometimes one, being very disappointed, he commits suicide. But will anybody recommend that, that "You are so disappointed. Now you commit suicide"? Nobody will do so. So similarly, the skepticism is disappointed. We say, "Why you are disappointed? You come to the spiritual platform and you will be happy." That is our version. So we are not going to accept his philosophy, skepticism, but we want to deliver him from this fallen condition. That is our mission. He is in false conception, that disappointment. Why? Our Vedic literature says, //ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. The living entity, the spirit soul, is by nature happy. There is no question of disappointment. You see Kṛṣṇa's picture anywhere, how they are happy. The //gopīs// are happy, the cowherd boys are happy, Kṛṣṇa is happy. Simply happiness. Where is disappointment? So you come to that platform. Then you will be also happy. You come to Kṛṣṇa. Dance with Kṛṣṇa. Eat with Kṛṣṇa. And that is information we are giving. Where is the question of disappointment? Come with Kṛṣṇa.

Kṛṣṇa therefore comes personally to show how He is happy in Vṛndāvana, and He is inviting, "Come to Me." //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You just come to Me. I shall give you all pleasure." But we are not going. So that is not Kṛṣṇa's fault or Kṛṣṇa's servant's fault. One who will not come to that platform, that is his fault. We are canvassing everywhere that "Come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and be happy. And see whether you are not..." Otherwise, if they are not happy, how the man, woman, the boy, the child, the father, the mother, the black and white, everyone is dancing. Why? This is the platform of happiness. So we are inviting, "Come to this platform. Why you should remain disappointed?" That is our mission. It is equally good for the skeptics, for the atheist, for the agnostic, for the theist, for everyone. Is that all right?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you.

**Devotee:**
Thank you, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. So? [end]
