[predominantly Hindi throughout]

**Yogi Bhajan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] We have got a picture of Māyāpur.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Upendra? You have a picture of Māyāpur? Sample there?

**Yogi Bhajan:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
From the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [conversation continues in Hindi, with Jain Muni also, discussing Prabhupāda's various centers around the world and Ratha-yātrā] [aside:] What is this?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[bringing picture] Māyāpur. The farm project.

**Yogi Bhajan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation continues between three; more pictures shown, New Vrindaban]

**Jain Muni:**
They will take //prasāda.// [Hindi conversation continues]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi about churches] They have lost interest, the younger generation... [Hindi conversation continues] I am against manufacturing religion. I am totally against. [Hindi continues] Fourth Chapter.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
You can read. Fourth Chapter. //Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
First verse.

**Yogi Bhajan:**
[Hindi]

**Devotee:**

> śrī-bhagavān uvāca
> imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
> proktavān aham avyayam
> vivasvān manave prāha
> manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt
> [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]

Translation: "The Blessed Lord said: I instructed this imperishable science of //yoga// to the sun-god, Vivasvān, and Vivasvān instructed it to Manu, the father of mankind, and Manu in turn instructed it to Ikṣvāku." Purport?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Devotee:**
"Herein we find the history of the //Bhagavad-gītā// traced from a remote time when it was delivered to the royal order, the kings of all planets. This science is especially meant for the protection of the inhabitants, and therefore the royal order should understand it in order to be able to rule the citizens and protect them from material bondage to lust. Human life is meant for cultivation of spiritual knowledge, in eternal relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the executive heads of all states and all planets are obliged to impart this lesson to the citizens by education, culture and devotion. In other words, the executive heads of all states are intended to spread the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that the people may take advantage of this great science..."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ.// [Hindi continues, discussing sun planet and other planetary arrangements described in //Bhāgavatam//]

**Jain Muni:**
[Hindi] Happy, healthy, holy. [Hindi continues]

**Prabhupāda:**
[to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa] Have you got the old pictures when I am acting as priest in Boston, like that? [Hindi continues, talking about //sannyāsa// and different kinds of //daṇḍa//] //...kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ.// [aside:] You can find out this verse. I think it is Second Canto. //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ.//

**Yogi Bhajan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi continues]

**Devotee:**

> kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā
> ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ
> ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ
> śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ
> [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]

"Kirāta, Hūṇa, Āndhra, Pulinda, Pulkaśa, Ābhīra, Śumbha, Yavana, members of the Khasa races and even others addicted to sinful acts can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.."

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] Purport?

**Devotee:**
"//Kirāta:// A province of old Bhārata-varṣa mentioned in the //Bhīṣma-parva// of //Mahābhārata.// Generally the Kirātas are known as the aboriginal tribes of India, and in modern days the Santal Parganas in Bihar and Chota Nagpur might comprise the old province named Kirāta.

"//Hūṇa:// The area of East Germany and part of Russia is known as the province of the Hūṇas. Accordingly, sometimes a kind of hill tribe is known as the Hūṇas.

"//Āndhra:// A province in southern India mentioned in the //Bhīṣma-parva// of //Mahābhārata.// It is still extant under the same name.

"//Pulinda:// It is mentioned in the //Mahābhārata// [//Ādi// 174.38], that is, the inhabitants of the province of the name Pulinda. This country was once conquered by Bhīmasena and Sahadeva. The Greeks are known as Pulindas, and it is mentioned in the //Vana-parva// of //Mahābhārata// that the non-Vedic race of this part of the world would rule over the world. This Pulinda province was also one of the provinces of Bhārata, and the inhabitants were classified among the //kṣatriya// kings. But later on, due to their..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Pulinda, they are mentioned in the Greeks. [Hindi continues] They are not very civilized. The Russians belong to that, Huns. And Mongolians. [Hindi continues, with some interspersed English]

**Yogi Bhajan:**
I wrote in one of my letter, I say, "I love you very much. Is my Motherland. But one dollar sent to you puts down eight Americans in communication. I regret, I can't take that terrible loss. Therefore the sanction [indistinct]." But you are great. You have built lot of temples there. [Hindi conversation talking about Bombay and Hyderabad] Question is very simple. As far as Golden Temple is concerned, that is Delhi's house. [Hindi] They have lot of temples and a lot of good work, and let them learn to by themselves. [Hindi] I have no time to spoil it. He is great. That is what I want to learn, how he can do that. And I don't believe that. My territory, they define. It starts... It ends at the Suez Canal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Suez Canal means whole Mediterranean.

**Yogi Bhajan:**
Yes, Mediterranean. And there I have up to Singapore, Malaysia. So I said, "Well, you have forgotten writing down Burma, and you never wrote a word about India, so goodbye." That is not our territory. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] //Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. [Hindi conversation]

**Yogi Bhajan:**
[Hindi] We have the best attorney here in this area, and you are having a trouble with this temple. If you... Somebody if you can call, because in this area he is the best law attorney.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, you can take the address.

**Devotee:**
We have their phone number.

**Yogi Bhajan:**
We won that... Recently he won a very big case. This is our daily fight, but it comes on you sometimes. We fight it daily. We fight before it happens to us. If I was to buy this temple I would have insured the title in a suit case, and I would have filed the suit myself, but on the neighborhood.

**Devotee:**
Yes, well they had approved our moving in.

**Yogi Bhajan:**
That is something later, but I have talked with. That is simple. I would have sued this area. I have heard that I can be damaged, I would have sued them five million dollars, all this area, vicinity. I could have proved it, because I would have done it. Moment they would have filed the case, proof was there. I had not to prove. Their own document would have proved it. But you know that attorney they had.

**Jain Muni:**
[Hindi, looking at pictures]

**Yogi Bhajan:**
So I think here in this case, because this is one of the typical case. Their plea is very simple plea against which you have to come out with a very strong argument. They say it were the temple, a certain frequency. You have changed the frequency, and therefore you have disturbed the environment and the ecology. I studied the entire case. I got all my information sale and I got it. So that's their main contention. Now what you have to prove is very ticklish. Therefore each paper must be filed very comparatively right, because this is they call invocation of the zonal area. To relieve the pressure on the subsidies of the zones and that lies on a miracle[?]. So if your attorney comes down the defense of it, and then you can get under Amendment One, and then they can't touch you. It's a very, very good fight. We fought it. That's why... And we won it. They got us on the same point. But what we did was, we had already filed a complaint, or we knew it was going to come. That case went out of the court just like that.

**Devotee:**
We will consult with your attorney.

**Yogi Bhajan:**
No, no, he is expert. They have figured it out. Because we are very conspicuous in this some way. You get away with things, you know, you are all right. But with us it is not. "That's the man. Get him."

**Devotee:**
We have legal battles wherever we go.

**Yogi Bhajan:**
We have a battle on every step. We wear a //kapon// [Sikh knife], we have a battle on every step. They say, "It is a knife. You can't carry it." We fight every few steps. Social dangers... We have more social aggressive dangers than you. But if you just channel it on a patterned style, you know, pattern thirteen. Now what we fight is this fight is pattern thirteen. Fight it. We go, we go through. [Hindi continues]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is Nanda Kumāra ready?

**Devotee:**
Nanda Kumāra is... Do you want to take here or...?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Jain Muni:**
In that room. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
World Fellowship...

**Jain Muni:**
World Fellowship of Religion. Kirpal Singh, president. [Hindi continues] Unity of Man Conference. [Hindi continues]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] Therefore we are not anxious to adjust things here. //Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.// [Hindi continues] You ready?

**Upendra:**
Just preparing.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Jain Muni:**
Good is two words, two o's. You have to be God first, then to be good to anybody. [Hindi] Charity begins from home. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] //Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// [Hindi conversation] [aside:] So? We have made?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi, inviting them to take //prasād//] [Hindi conversation] Give him pad. [Hindi] [end]
