**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
[introducing recording; testing microphone] //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// class, Sixth Canto, First Chapter, text forty-two, recorded June 23rd, 1975.

**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse]

> sūryo 'gniḥ khaṁ marud devaḥ
> somaḥ sandhyāhanī diśaḥ
> kaṁ kuḥ svayaṁ dharma iti
> hy ete daihyasya sākṣiṇaḥ
> [[books:sb:6:1:42|[SB 6.1.42]]]

[04:35]

"The sun, fire, sky, air, demigods, moon, evening, day, night, directions, water, land and the Supersoul Himself all are witnesses..., all witness the activities of the living entity."

**Prabhupāda:**

> sūryo 'gniḥ khaṁ marud devaḥ
> somaḥ sandhyāhanī diśaḥ
> kaṁ kuḥ svayaṁ dharma iti
> hy ete daihyasya sākṣiṇaḥ
> [[books:sb:6:1:42|[SB 6.1.42]]]

Sometimes foolish people challenge that "Who has seen? Who has seen?" Sometimes they argue, Christian philosophers, that "If I am suffering the resultant action of my past life, then where is the witness that I have done something wrong in my past life? Where is the witness?" So to them this is the answer, that God has created so many witnesses. The first witness is //sūrya,// the sun. How you can go away from the sunlight? Anywhere you go... We are in this room. Because it is daytime, the sunlight is there. //Sūryaḥ agniḥ. Agniḥ// means fire. We have to touch with fire in so many ways. The factories are working fire, the electric powerhouse, the electricity, the oven, the kitchen, fire. So //agniḥ..., sūryaḥ agniḥ kham ākāśa:// sky. Where you can escape sky? Within the room there is sky; outside, the sky; up, the sky; down, the sky. Everywhere sky. //Sūryaḥ agniḥ khaṁ marud:// air. Where is no air? Every place there is air. //Devaḥ. Devaḥ// means the Supreme Lord. What is that //devaḥ?//

**Nitāi:**
[indistinct] demigods.

**Prabhupāda:**
Demigods or God. God is also situated in everyone's heart. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. //Devaḥ.// And //sandhyā.// In the morning there is sun, in the evening there is moon, and //sandhyā ahanī. Ahanī// means day. And //diśaḥ,// the direction: east, west, north, south, then corner, then up and down. These are called //diśaḥ. Kaṁ:// then water. And //kuḥ,// means the land. //Kaṁ kuḥ svayaṁ dharma.// And the Dharmarāja, Yamarāja, he is present. //Iti,// "thus," //hi,// "indeed," //ete,// "all these," //daihyasya. Daihyasya// means one who has accepted this body, material body. A living entity who has accepted this material body, he has to work. This is called field of work. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is called... What is called?

**Devotees:**
//Kṣetra.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kṣetra,// yes. //Kṣetra-kṣetrajña.// I am //kṣetrajña.// I am the soul. I know this is my body. I never say "I, the body." "My body." Never say "I body." Nobody says. So //daihyasya.// Any sane man, he knows that "I am not this body. It is my body." I never say "I finger." "My finger." I never say "I head." "My head." So this body is mine.

So anyone who has accepted this body, //daihyasya,// and whatever he is doing, it is all being witnessed by so many witnesses. How can you avoid? How you can do something very secretly? That is not possible. Everything is being noted. And so punishment or reward you will have to accept, because you are not independent. We foolishly say independent. "We don't care for anybody. There is no God." But there is death. That you have to believe. So that death is God. Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś ca// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]. One who does not see God during lifetime, so he will see God at the time of death. So there is no question of not seeing God. Here is God, Kṛṣṇa. He is standing. He is so merciful. He has come to this temple so that we can take the advantage of seeing Him. But we are seeing Him still idol or something stone or wood. He does not know that because we cannot see now at the present moment without being wood or stone or something material, so Kṛṣṇa has very kindly come to me so that I can see Him in a form which I can see. That is His mercy. We have repeatedly said this.

Therefore we should never think, //arcye viṣṇu śilā-dhīḥ,// the worshipable Deity, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, as made of stone. In the higher sense, stone is also Kṛṣṇa, because Kṛṣṇa's energy. Just like if you go to the street, you may see the sun in the sky, but when you are within the room, you may not see the sun in the sky directly. But because it is daytime, therefore we can understand there is sun on the sky. Similarly, we do not require to see God directly. We can see Him through His energy. Just like in a telephone hanger, as soon as somebody speaks, immediately see him. How it is possible? By his word, immediately see him. You are in a closed room, somebody knocking, and you say, "Who is it?" He says, "I am." So immediately by his voice, you can see him. So why do you want to see directly? We can see anything by his energy. Just like if you feel heat here, then immediately you becomes alert, "Oh, there must be some fire." If there is some smoke, immediately you can understand that there is fire. So by intelligence and by the energy of God, you can see God. That is intelligence. So Kṛṣṇa says,

> bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ
> khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca
> ahaṅkāra itī me
> bhinnā prakṛtiḥ aṣṭadhā
> [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]

"It is My energy." So stone is also energy of Kṛṣṇa, but you have not eyes to see Kṛṣṇa in the stone. That is your defect. Kṛṣṇa says that "This is My energy." Just like you can see, by energy, you can see the energetic, similarly, by seeing Kṛṣṇa's energy, you can see Kṛṣṇa.

Therefore those who are advanced devotee, for them, there is nothing material; everything is Kṛṣṇa. //Sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhe nā dekhe tāra mūrti// [[books:cc:madhya:8:274|[Cc. Madhya 8.274]]]. Actually, a Vaiṣṇava is factually monist, because he does not see anything except Kṛṣṇa. Anything he sees, he will think, "This is Kṛṣṇa's energy." So why it is not Kṛṣṇa? So Kṛṣṇa also says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]: "I am expanded everywhere." //Avyakta-mūrtinā. Avyakta// means "not manifest." He is in the fire. He is in the water. He is in the land. He is in the sky. Everywhere. He is in the mind. He is in intelligence. He is soul. He's part and... So Kṛṣṇa is everywhere; simply you have to make your eyes how to see Him. That is required. That is //prema. Premāṇjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. Those who are //santaḥ,// saintly person, they always see Kṛṣṇa. Why? //Premāñjana-cchurita,// because he is in love with Kṛṣṇa. Just like you have your beloved child. Although he is out of sight, you can see him in his shoe, in his cloth, in his toy: "Oh, it is my child." That requires //prema.// Similarly, if you have knowledge, theoretical knowledge even, that everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy, and if you have love for Kṛṣṇa, with reference to the context, whatever you see, you see Kṛṣṇa.

That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You cannot see anywhere where there is no Kṛṣṇa. This is for the devotee. For the ordinary person these are the description, that the //sūrya,// the sun, is also Kṛṣṇa, the fire is also Kṛṣṇa, the sky is also Kṛṣṇa, the air is also Kṛṣṇa, the moon is also Kṛṣṇa, the evening is Kṛṣṇa, daytime is Kṛṣṇa. Then how you can avoid Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa says that "I am..." //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. You cannot avoid Kṛṣṇa. Simply on account of your foolishness, //māyā// is covering your eyes to see Kṛṣṇa. So //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. If you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then //māyā's// curtain will be taken away and you will see Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. This is required. Then you become perfect as soon as you learn how to see Kṛṣṇa everywhere. This is the art, transcendental art, spiritual art, how to see Kṛṣṇa. Then you become perfect. That is wanted.

So the devotee of Kṛṣṇa, they know that "Everywhere is Kṛṣṇa, and I cannot do anything, concealing myself from the eyes of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore I should not do anything which is sinful." This is the first step of advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are thinking that "Although we are doing this sinful activity, Kṛṣṇa cannot see." No, Kṛṣṇa will see. You should always know that. Kṛṣṇa will see. And Kṛṣṇa says that unless one is free from all sinful activities, he cannot be engaged in full devotional service of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

> yeṣāṁ anta-gataṁ tu pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇāṁ
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

So we should wilfully try to become... He is seeing, but there are two kinds of seeing. When you act sinfully, that is also being seen by Kṛṣṇa, and when you are serving Him, that is also being seen by Kṛṣṇa.

So we have to be seen by Him that we are actually acting for Him as His servant. Then we will be recognized. You cannot conceal Him. He is seeing. He can see everything. But when you act sinfully, then the //māyā's// curtain prohibits you not to see Kṛṣṇa. But when you actually surrender to Him, then you can see Kṛṣṇa is present. He is seeing everything. That is wanted. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that "Don't try to see Kṛṣṇa. Try to become being seen by Kṛṣṇa." That is wanted. You cannot see Kṛṣṇa so long... //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. So long we have got these material eyes, material senses, we cannot hear... Others may chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, he is enjoying, and others, they are thinking disturbing, the same chanting. So because one has got this material ear, he is thinking it is disturbing, and one who has got spiritual ear, then he is enjoying, "Oh, here is Hare Kṛṣṇa chant." This is the difference.

So we have to purify our senses. Then we shall see Kṛṣṇa. We shall know that Kṛṣṇa is seeing us, our activities, our sinful activities, and we have to suffer for this. We have to accept a similar body. Just Kṛṣṇa says,

> īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati
> bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
> yantrārūḍhāni māyayā
> [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]

So everybody of us, we are getting a new type of body. This is a //yantra.// This is a machine given by Kṛṣṇa through the agency of material nature. This body is made of material nature. I am the owner of the body or driver of the body, and Kṛṣṇa is the giver of the body. We should always remember. Kṛṣṇa is sitting within us, and He knows what kind of body I am desiring. So He is immediately ordering material nature that "You give him such and such body." And she is ready. She can manufacture millions of types of body in a second, material nature. That you have seen, nature, how all of a sudden all the trees become green. Yesterday or day before yesterday, there was no leaf. And the third day, in the morning, you see all the trees are full with leaves. How it is done? So nature is so powerful. Immediately. So therefore... Similarly, our bodies, your body, my body, millions and trillions and numberless body, immediately created. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi...// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. We have to study like that, how //prakṛti// is working. The //prakṛti// is not under your control. That //prakṛti// is working under the supervision of Kṛṣṇa. //Mayādhaykṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram.// As soon as Kṛṣṇa says, "Now make all the trees leafless," immediately leafless. He says, "Make the all the trees with all leafs," immediately with leaves. That is God; that is //prakṛti.// Try to understand like that. Why you compare your silly intelligence with God's intelligence? "I cannot do it; therefore God cannot do it." "I cannot see God; therefore God cannot see me." These rascaldom is going on. Because I am an insignificant creature, //kṣudrad api. Kṣudra. Kṣuḍra// means very, very insignificant---I am comparing myself with the intelligence of God. This is my fault[?].

So we have to give up this nonsense idea as knowledge. We have to understand God as it is said in the //śāstras.// Practically, you have to judge. Then we shall understand God, His intelligence, how He is working. Because in the previous verse it is said,

> yena sva-dhāmny amī bhāvā
> rajaḥ-sattva-tamomayāḥ
> guṇa-nāma-kriyā-rūpair
> vibhāvyante yathā-tatham
> [[books:sb:6:1:41|[SB 6.1.41]]]

Everything is being supplied by the nature. By the order of Kṛṣṇa, according to the modes of nature, we are contaminating //guṇa-nāma.// As we are infected with a certain type of //guṇa,// immediately our body, activities, name... We have contacted, contaminated, with //tamo-guṇa.// There are so many animals in the //tamo-guṇa//---trees, plants. //Tamo-guṇa:// darkness, no knowledge. So similarly, //sattva-guṇa.// If you associate with //sattva-guṇa,// then you get the body of a //brāhmaṇa,// intelligent man, saintly man. Everything is ready. It requires only our association, that's all.

Therefore the advice is that "You all become the topmost qualified man." That is the propaganda of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. "Become first-class topmost men. Don't remain..." //Tamasi mā:// "Don't remain in darkness." This is our only request. Otherwise... But why we are making this propaganda? Because Kṛṣṇa wants. We are all servant of Kṛṣṇa; therefore our only aim is to serve Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa wants that "Save these rascals from //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// Bring them transcendent to //sattva-guṇa,// and they will be happy." This is Kṛṣṇa's desire. //Nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna// [[books:bg:2:45|[Bg. 2.45]]]: "Arjuna, you become above the three //guṇas.//" That is the Kṛṣṇa's desire. "Why you are bothering with these //guṇas,// 'This is my body. This is my family. This is this. This is this. This is this'? You are arguing so much." So therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna:// "These are on the material platform. Come to the spiritual platform." Ultimately He said that "You are My very dear friend. Therefore I am disclosing to you the most confidential knowledge." //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is the whole instruction.

So all these //śāstras,// all these //Vedas,// all this knowledge, they are simply leading to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. But in the Kali-yuga it is very difficult to go step by step. People are so fallen, so much engrossed in //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// Therefore, by the mercy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He has empowered the holy name of God, that simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// you can make equal progress than in other ages. //Kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt.//

> kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ
> tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ
> dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ
> kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt
> [SB 12.3.52]

This is the injunction of the //śāstra,// that in the Satya-yuga people used to live for 100,000's of years. At that time you could meditate upon for sixty thousand years; still, forty thousand years you can live perfectly. But it is not possible now. Therefore the supreme perfection attained in the Satya-yuga by meditation was possible in the next //yuga,// Tretā-yuga, by performing sacrifices. //Tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ. Dvāpare paricaryāyām.// In the next age, by worshiping Deity, //paricaryāyām. Kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt:// the same result you will get. Because Kali-yuga, it is very difficult to be fixed up in meditation or to perform very costly //yajñas// or to perform worship of the Deity. That is also difficult. I am very much pleased that you are worshiping Deity very nicely, gorgeously. But in India you will find there are so many temples. Of course, it requires the energy. Otherwise here also, there are so many churches, now they are being closed. This church..., this was a church. Now it was closed. There was no customer. And now it is filled up. Why? The same church, the same men, the same spot. It is due to real knowledge.

So if you go on simply opening centers, if there is no knowledge, then it will again become a closed church someday. So don't do that. Before opening a center you must have perfect worshiper, perfect devotees. Not perfect; at least those who are willing to become. Then open. Otherwise, simply chant. //Kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt.// That will never be impaired. Anywhere you chant, you will be successful. Anywhere. Sit down. If you chant without any offense, then //kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt// [SB 12.3.52]. But if possible, open nice centers, worship nicely. That will be very good. But if you are unable to do anything, either the meditation or offering sacrifices, worshiping the Deity, in this age, simply if you sincerely chant without any offense, then your life is sure to be successful.

Thank you very much.
