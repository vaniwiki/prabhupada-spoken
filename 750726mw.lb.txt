**Brahmānanda:**
...shortage that they will make processes for eating the seaweed.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are already doing that.

**Rāmeśvara:**
It is considered a health food in many vegetarian restaurants. They import it as a health food.

**Prabhupāda:**
That Ahmedabad, that gentleman in his house, you were guest... You were in Ahmedabad?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Ahmedabad, that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
...homeopathic doctor?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that gentleman, his name I forget now.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Patel?

**Prabhupāda:**
Patel, yes. Not the doctor; the young man in whose house we became guest. He's doing this business.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Eating it.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's mixing with something, making like that Chinese grass and what you call? His business.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The Chinese eat this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Chinese, Japanese.

**Rāmeśvara:**
In Japan, it is very popular.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
They have farms, they call them sea farms, and they specially grow the seaweed for cultivation.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa is very kind. If you want this kind of food, He'll give you facility.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But the Vedic culture, I don't think they like this. They'll prefer the... Do you think, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Vedic culture means //kṛṣṇa-prasāda.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Kṛṣṇa... You cannot offer this to Kṛṣṇa, can you?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. [break]

**Devotee (1):**
...seaweed they eat. It grows out further. This isn't edible, they say.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything is edible, but meant for different living entities. Stool is also edible, meant for the hogs. In the last war, stool was also eaten by human beings. You know that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, the Germans. [break]

**Devotee (1):**
...take the deities on a walk down this way, up to the park, and put them underneath this gazebo there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Park. That is a park?

**Devotee (1):**
Yes, it's a park up there. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...anantaya kalpate. Ananta.// [break] ...the different language. [pause] //Hut// means "go away." [break]

**Devotee (2):**
...that thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Means you haven't got master. [end]
