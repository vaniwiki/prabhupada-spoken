[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...and artificially they construct big, big cities.

**Jagadīśa:**
We made a wrong turn.

**Prabhupāda:**
Wrong?

**Jagadīśa:**
Wrong turn we made back at the beginning of the street. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...coming. Why?

**Brahmānanda:**
This is more pleasant.

**Satsvarūpa:**
In a newspaper report, Śrīla Prabhupāda, about India, it said that the mass of people in the rural areas didn't even know that there was an emergency rule. They don't... It's so peaceful. They're not affected. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...of people, they do not care for these political things. Even in Gandhi's strong civil disobedience movement, out of the whole population of India, only sixty-thousand men joined. What is the India's population?

**Brahmānanda:**
Six hundred million.

**Prabhupāda:**
Six hundred million, and out of that, sixty thousand joined, and it became successful. Sixty thousand joined by statistics. Actually worker, I don't think more than ten thousand people. [pause] Exactly like Indian village. Here there is no business. They simply reside.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

[break] [on walk]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...it's over there somewhere. He's one of the world's richest men, H. L. Hunt. He's a Dallas oil millionaire. Some devotees tried to approach him, but at his house he has servants and... At least the servant took a //Bhagavad-gītā.// They couldn't see the man himself.

**Dayānanda:**
He died.

**Satsvarūpa:**
He's dead?

**Dayānanda:**
A few months ago. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...otogrika?//[?] Similar like that. [break] ...dollars?

**Brahmānanda:**
Daily.

**Prabhupāda:**
Daily.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. That means about four thousand a month. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...of man, why? Why this movement?

**Jagadīśa:**
Because the men are exploiting them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. That is the fact. They are dissatisfied with the treatment of man. The grievance is that they do not get husband, home, children; like loitering on the street. That is their aspiration: they want good home, good husband, good children. That they are not getting. Oh, it is a very big lake. [end]
