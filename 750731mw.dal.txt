**Brahmānanda:**
...hired these gangsters, professional gangsters to do this. So now one of these gangsters, he was to give testimony, and now he was killed. So they're thinking maybe the CIA also is doing that.

**Prabhupāda:**
And who is advising CIA?

**Brahmānanda:**
The president. Nixon used to use the CIA to... If he had any enemy, he would have the CIA investigate that man. He was using it for his personal political purposes. [break] ...testing. In the early 1960s they were testing the effects of LSD, and so they gave LSD secretly into this one officer's coffee drink. And he drank it. He did not know it was LSD, and he went crazy and committed suicide. So now this investigation of CIA has uncovered this information. So now the family of this officer, they are suing the CIA for millions of dollars. [break] ... regular business of breaking into foreign embassies. In New York and Washington they did over 1500 break-ins---photographing documents, stealing coding machines. Sometimes when they would break in at night into one embassy, they would meet agents of another country who also were breaking into the same embassy, and they would salute one another. [laughter] It's a regular business.

**Prabhupāda:**
They will not kill each other?

**Brahmānanda:**
No, they respected one another because they were both after the same embassy. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...black government is going on all over the world. What they will think of people's welfare?

**Brahmānanda:**
They are all against us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply political gain. [break]

**Jagadīśa:**
...go back to the temple we'll be performing //āratik// to Your Divine Grace. And there was not very much time. I was wondering whether during the time we're performing //āratik// to you, whether it's proper to be giving out cookies to the children?

**Prabhupāda:**
As you make convenient.

**Jagadīśa:**
Is that proper?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. So we can go back now. Again program. [break] ...just now?

**Jagadīśa:**
6:30.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] I am not feeling very well. Last yesterday also. Heaviness. I am not clearing my bowels very nicely.

**Jagadīśa:**
Is it due to the heat, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know why, but I am not... Constipation? And now I'm feeling headache, some spasm.

**Jagadīśa:**
Should we cancel the trip this morning? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...very hot place. So every year I used to resolute, "Now I shall give up this place," every year. I was going Kashmir, Darjeeling. Bhavani, that is near Nainital. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...just in the hot climate. In the hot climate it is more difficult to digest?

**Prabhupāda:**
Maybe.

**Brahmānanda:**
Because here it is much hotter than it was in California.

**Jagadīśa:**
The //prasādam// you're getting is all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not very all right. Constantly change of hand is not good.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. So Upendra can cook for you? Can Upendra cook? Just like Śrutakīrti, he used to use the cooker. He would put up the vegetables and then give massage. And then after massage he would just //chaunce// the vegetables. He was able to do everything ourself.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everyone was doing that. So we shall go or wait?

**Satsvarūpa:**
After New Orleans, all your stops are in northern. Detroit and Canada. It won't be so hot.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, now what is the time?

**Devotees:**
Twenty to seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we shall wait or shall go?

**Jagadīśa:**
Well, I've sent the others on ahead to let them know that we'll be early. So it should be all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the scheduled time?

**Jagadīśa:**
The Deities usually are opened at 7:10.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So we shall wait, or go?

**Jagadīśa:**
Either way.

**Brahmānanda:**
What about we go and have the //āratik// first?

**Jagadīśa:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
And then after the //āratik,// the curtains can be opened. Then Prabhupāda could speak. And after speaking, give out the beads. Because we have to leave... [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
Can we go now?

**Jagadīśa:**
Yes.

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
Why money? "No. Because I will be able to satisfy my senses more and more." This is the whole civilization. They have no other aim, no other ideas. "How to get money?"

**Brahmānanda:**
Another thing that is difficult for health is the constant flying in jet plane.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [end]
