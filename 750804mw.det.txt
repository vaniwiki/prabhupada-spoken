====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Big fish? [laughter]

**Ambarīṣa:**
That's a catfish.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Ambarīṣa:**
A catfish.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cap?

**Ambarīṣa:**
Cat. Catfish.

**Brahmānanda:**
A very low class fish. It eats the stool of the other fish.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Black? It is black?

**Mādhavānanda:**
Yes. Black. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
We call //magur mach.// One who cannot digest anything, he is recommended to eat this fish, //magur mach. Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam// [[books:sb:1:13:47|[SB 1.13.47]]]. One living entity is the life of another living entity. [//japa//] [break]

**Mādhavānanda:**
Is it wet?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Ambarīṣa? Is there another way we can go? It's wet.

**Ambarīṣa:**
We can go back around on the road and then walk along that road over there. [devotees chanting //japa//] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Grass is coming out. Where is the chemical? How the grass is coming out from the stone side? //Harer nāma harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. [break] ...he will go?

**Śrī Govinda:**
Around the island. Right around the island.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very fast going, but where he will go? [break] ...victory?

**Brahmānanda:**
Admiral Perry.

**Satsvarūpa:**
He defeated the British in 1812.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, he was an American.

**Prabhupāda:**
Admiral Perry.

**Brahmānanda:**
Admiral Perry. He defeated the British in the War of 1812.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break] ...church tower?

**Brahmānanda:**
None of our men have ever been here, I don't think.

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall go that way? [break] ...piece of grass coming out. Another [indistinct]. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...Canada.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where is Canada?

**Mādhavānanda:**
Right there.

**Prabhupāda:**
That side. [end]
