====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...tree you collected the //dantana.// Huh?

**Brahmānanda:**
Which tree did you collect this..., twigs from?

**Ambarīṣa:**
Oh, over by your apartment.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. What is that tree?

**Ambarīṣa:**
It was a fir tree. Fir. Fir wood.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Brahmānanda:**
Fir. F-i-r.

**Ambarīṣa:**
It's a type of pine tree.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. It is good.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Okay. //Jaya.// [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
This tree is very common?

**Ambarīṣa:**
Yes. There are quite a few around Michigan.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you have seen the tree?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You collect the wood. [break] ...monkey in this country?

**Ambarīṣa:**
No, no wild monkeys.

**Brahmānanda:**
Only civilized monkeys. [laughter]

**Ambarīṣa:**
We are living in the cities.

**Prabhupāda:**
At least civilized man's forefather.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...bigger this monkey. You remember? We were walking in that park?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. Oh, yes. Many were in the trees, jumping. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...birds who eat monkey. You know that? I have seen in Los Angeles zoo, monkey-eating bird. They capture the monkey by the neck and drop it. And when it falls down it dies, and meat. And I have seen one statue in the Central Park. They are catching goats---eagle. And there are big eagles, they catch up elephant. [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
Just some person who wants to glorify himself. Dudder.[?] [break] A boy will write his name and his girlfriend's name on some tree.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Brahmānanda:**
So their love will live as long as the tree. Maybe they will also become trees. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...thinks of woman at the time of death, he becomes woman. And if a woman thinks of man at the time of death, she becomes man. [break] ...afraid of men?

**Ambarīṣa:**
I don't think that they will let you go too close, but I don't know... Someone told me yesterday that people come out here and shoot them with bows and arrows and take them home and eat them. So they are not safe even here. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...interested to see us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...deer. They are just off the road.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. "No standing"?

**Brahmānanda:**
For the cars. The cars should not remain here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Car is "parking," they say? Or "standing"?

**Brahmānanda:**
"Standing" means if the person remains inside. [break]

**Ādi-keśava:**
I spoke to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa on the phone the other day, and he asked me to tell you that we're sending 64,000 to your book fund for this month. And he said also he promises you 100,000 per month by the end of the year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good news. [aside:] Good morning. [break]

**Ādi-keśava:**
...and to tell you that he will be distributing over fourteen thousand of your big books every month: 125,000 of your //Back to Godheads,// and at least ten thousand of your medium size books, like the //Kṛṣṇa// trilogy book or the //Beyond Birth and Death,// those books.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he is going over Tripurāri?

**Ādi-keśava:**
Well, Tripurāri is also with us.

**Brahmānanda:**
Includes Tripurāri.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Including both.

**Ādi-keśava:**
Yes, both. Now, what is happening, Tripurāri is training some of our men in the airports. He is training nine new men to distribute big books in the airports, men who were before distributing only the magazines. Now they will go to the airports and learn how to distribute the big books. And also some of Tripurāri's men have taken over the leadership of our parties to help the new men to distribute also. So that way they are cooperating. [end]
