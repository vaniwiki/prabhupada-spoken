**Prabhupāda:**
Translation? You have got? English or Hindi? Hmm?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
English or Hindi?

**Prabhupāda:**
We are now discussing the story of Ajamila. He was a Brahmin boy with all //brahmanical// qualities. The qualities are described as, //aya hi sruta-sampanna.// This man was in his youth and married, //śruta-sampannaḥ//

//Sruta// means ‘Vedic knowledge’. Veda is called //sruti// and the knowledge obtained from hearing the Vedas that is called //srotrayam// and //sruta.// It is the Vedic knowledge heard from the spiritual master. It is a thing to be heard. First hear. We are having these //satsangs// or spiritual meetings, the aim is that all of you should come and listen to this Vedic knowledge. By constant listening you will acquire the knowledge. It is not necessary to read it. If one does not know how to read and write then how will he acquire knowledge? By hearing! God has given him ears to hear. In the earlier days this Vedic knowledge was acquired by hearing from the spiritual master. 

There were no written books. Vyasadeva wrote books at the beginning of //Kaliyuga// when he realized that the remembering power of humans would decline in this //yuga// and so they will not be able to acquire knowledge only through listening. There must be books to read and keep. That is why I am printing so many books. You come hear listen and then go away but this will not work. Read all these books as you will then acquire Vedic knowledge. Why this Brahmin boy Ajamila is in such a bad position is being explained by the messengers of Yamaraja. This person had all the //brahmanical// qualities. What are those qualities- //sruta//-saimpannah He had heard //sruta-sampannah,// the Vedas very nicely. //Sampannah// means he had heard all the four Vedas till the end. And //sila-vrtta-gunalayah,// in his social dealings he was of good character, well mannered. //Dhrta-vrata// means full determination. The Lord says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha
> daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ
> bhajanty ananya-manaso
> [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]

The word is //Dhrta-vrata. Dhrta-vrata// means definite. To get up at four in the morning is definite, there is no compromise on that. Someone gets up and someone doesn’t, No! You have to get up at four in the morning every day that is called //dhrta-vrata// and //dhirah-vrata.// Not that you occasionally get up at four in the morning, No! every day one must get up. That is the duty of a Brahman. //dhrta-vrato mrdur,// he had a very mild nature. //Dantah,// to keep the senses under one’s control, this is the duty of a Brahman. //Sama, dama,// to keep the mind steady, to keep the senses steady. //Sama, dama, titiksha,// we must learn all this. So it is said, //mrdur dantah satya-van. Satya-van// means one who is always truthful. //mantra-vit,// he knew how to chant all the //vedic// hymns. //Sucih//- very neat and clean, taking bath thrice, keep clothes and body very clean. And //guru-agni-atithi-vrddhanam,// To respect these three things We must offer our prostrated obeisances on seeing the spiritual master //Dandavat.// And fire, we must do fire sacrifices every day. And guests, we must serve the unexpected guests when they visit our home. And //vrddhanam,// And specially old man we must satisfy and honor the old persons very nicely. These are all the qualities. And then //susrusur anahankrtah,// this Brahmin boy was doing all this despite having so many good qualities had no false prestige about this, //anahankrtah. sarva-bhuta-suhrt,// and he was friendly to all living entities and was the well-wisher of all living entities, //sarve sukhino bhavantu.// These are the good qualities of a human being. And //saduh,// each word here can be given a detailed meaning but I am explaining in short. So //saduh,// means devotee of the Lord. Just like the Lord has said in the //Bhagavad gita, sadhur eva sa mantavyah.// Who is a sadhu? 

> api cet su-durācāro
> bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
> sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ
> samyag vyavasito hi saḥ
> [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]

For one who is a devotee of the Lord, there is no service other than serving the Lord. Such a person is a sadhu. All these sadhus who are here do not talk unnecessarily. It is appropriate for a devotee to talk and chant Kṛṣṇa’s names only. Unnecessary talking will result in loss of life span only, no benefit in that. That is why the scriptures say, //vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanuvarnane.//

If you talk it should be relating to the Lord residing in //Vaikuntha.// Not about some cinema actresses. //sravanam kirtanam visnoh,// if you want to hear about someone, hear about the topics relating to Lord Vishnu. And if you want to talk about someone then talk about the pastimes of the Lord only. //Sravanam kirtanam visnoh.// 

> sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor
> vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane
> [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]

This is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness, "//Kṛṣṇa Bhavanamrta//". To keep the mind always engaged at the lotus feet of the Lord. And the Lord himself says,

> man-manā bhava mad-bhakto
> mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru
> [[books:bg:9:34|[Bg. 9.34]]]

This is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness, these four things. Always remembering the Lord, that is why we ask people to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa so that the mind is engaged in the Lord. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa when you listen to this, your mind will be engaged in that and that is meditation. 

//Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare. Man-mana,// and who will do that? //Mad-bhakto, man-mana bhava mad-bhakto.//

Without being a devotee why will he chant Hare Kṛṣṇa?

> man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī

"Worship Me" That is why the Lord has come to the temple, decorate Him nicely, offer flowers, offer foodstuffs, honor //prasadam.// These are the injunctions of the scriptures.

> man-manā bhava mad-bhakto
> mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru
> [[books:bg:9:34|[Bg. 9.34]]]

And if you can’t do any of these then come into the temple once and offer your obeisances. It is a very simple process not difficult. But we do not want to do it! We say what is the use of going to the temple, let us go to the restaurant and have a cup of tea, smoke a //bidi.// So why will we not suffer? When we discard the laws given in the scriptures, so can we ever be happy? No!

> yah s'a-stra-vidhim utsr.jya
> vartate ka-ma-ka-ratah.
> na sa siddhim ava-pnoti
> na sukham' na para-m' gatim

Such a person will never achieve happiness. We discard the scriptural injunctions and then expect to be happy, this is not possible! 

So this Brahmin boy who was about twenty to twenty five years old, he had learnt everything. What is the advantage of taking birth in a Brahman family. The others have to learn this but he can learn by seeing the behavior of the parents by virtue of his being born in a Brahman family, you learn automatically. This is the advantage. But having been born in a family of Brahmans and if the parents are not //Brahmanical// then how will the children learn? And these things are not taught in the schools and colleges. That is why there is degradation? So there are a number of reasons for this degradation and one of the reasons they are telling us here is, //ekadasau.// This Brahmin boy Ajamila once upon a time, //vanam yatah,// went into the forest. Actually not one day but it is the duty of the Brahman to go into the forest to collect flowers for offering to the Lord. The Lord says,

> patram pushpam phalam toyam
> yo me bhaktya prayacchati

To worship the Lord does not require much money. Those who can afford to spend must do so nicely. For one who does not have the money and so cannot spend, the Lord is still ready to accept a little leaf or some flowers. The Lord does not say feed me exotic foods (//loochi, poori, kachauri//) in a golden plate, He has enough on his own. There is no scarcity of food for Him. It is said,

> cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-
> lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
> lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ
> [Bs. 5.29]

The Lord is being served by hundreds and thousands of goddess of fortune. They are ready to serve! There is no shortage for the Lord. The Lord has not come to sit in Juhu, Mumbai as He does not have enough to eat and has to ask for some foodstuffs from you. This is not the case! He has appeared out of His causeless mercy so that we can perform

> man-mana bhava mad-bhakto
> mad-yaji mam namaskuru

He has given us the opportunity to serve Him. But you don’t want the Lord to be here nor do you want a temple to be built here under any circumstances! That is your pledge! The Lord has appeared out of his causeless mercy and you are hell bent on making sure that no temple is built here. When kirtan is performed you give an application to the police department that this kirtan is a nuisance! This is the situation. This is called //kaliyuga.// The Lord says,

> yada yada hi dharmasya
> glanir bhavati bharata
> abhyutthanam adharmasya
> tadatmanam srijamy aham

Whenever there is a decline in religious practices, then I descend Myself or I send one of My pure devotee out of My causeless mercy. But even if this happens we do not let Him be installed. This is the situation.

This Brahman boy had acquired all the good qualities. But one day when he was going to the forest. //Ekadasau vanam yatah.// Why do we go to the forest? //pitr-sandesa-krd dvijah.//

The father of this boy was at home worshipping the Lord and asked the boy to get flowers, grass etc from the forest. Being a Brahman he did not have much money. But the Lord says, "give me leaf or flower, what if you don’t have money?" You can get a leaf or a flower anywhere, inside the house or outside the house. It is not that the Lord is satisfied when only palatable dishes like //puri, halwa// etc are offered to Him. No, the Lord says,

> patram pushpam phalam toyam
> yo me bhaktya prayacchati
> aham asnami! 

"I eat the offerings." And once the Lord eats the foodstuffs offered by you then what shortage will you ever have? Then you are the richest man in the world! There are examples of this. Once the Lord eats out of the hands of someone, he will never face any shortage in his life. This is mentioned in the scriptures. Today everyone asks me what is the use of doing devotional service? People are poor and need to have food to eat. We advertise that people who do not have food to eat, clothes to wear and place to stay, please come to us. We are making good houses in Mumbai, come and stay there but no one comes. I have to get people from abroad to run the temple. Nobody comes! This is very sad indeed that no Indian comes for the Indian temple. They go to the mill but don’t come here. What should we do? We are requesting them to come and stay here, eat Kṛṣṇa //prasadam,// chant the Holy names and then you will get everything. The Lord himself says,

> teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ
> yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham

**Prabhupada:**
What is the first line.

**Devotee:**
//ananyāś cintayanto māṁ//

> ananyāś cintayanto māṁ
> ye janāḥ paryupāsate
> teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ
> yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham
> [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]]

**Prabhupada:**
If your mind is constantly engaged in the Lord, //ananyas cintayanto.// Like this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement where we teach //ananyas cintas,// twenty-four hours of the day the mind is engaged in the Lord. No other thoughts. Whatever is done is done for the Lord. You can actually see this happening here. We do not just sit around or sleep. No! We clean the temple, worship the Lord, decorate Him, offer Him //bhoga// and in order to do that we maintain a good kitchen and to run the kitchen we get the foodstuffs, we write books for the Lord. We get them printed from the press and once it is well done we try to sell them. So that is why twenty-four hours of the day we are engaged. Twenty-four hours! We do not have a single minute to spare. 

This is called //ananyas cintayanto.// No other thoughts, only about the Lord. Just like an ordinary person is worried about the household affairs, how to maintain it, how to educate the child, how to earn money- these are their thoughts. We are also thinking on the same lines but for the Lord!! How will the temple of the Lord be built here, why are we fighting so much for it? We are having 108 temples worldwide and if this one here is not built then we still have 107 temples for sure! So there is no loss for us in that but we think that Bombay is such a big city so why not have a grand temple here for the Lord. This is our thinking. But they are posing impediments- no, we will not allow. Let these impediments be there but we will not stop trying. 

We will keep trying, this is our job! Whether we are successful or not, that is not our worry. If He so desires we will be successful and if not then it is the Lord’s temple which we were not allowed to build. So there is no loss for us in this. This is man-//mana bhava mad-bhakto.// All these efforts who will do other than a devotee? Any other person would quit not wanting to take on so much trouble. Forget it! We could have spent this money on speculation in the share market and earned profit! Only a devotee can do this. That is why the Lord says man-//mana bhava mad-bhakto,// become My devotee! Because his thoughts will always be with the Lord and he is the greatest yogi who by any means engages his mind so, //yena tena parkarena.// This is the philosophy of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, //yena tena prakarena manah krsne nivesayet.// Engage your mind in the Lord by any means. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy. So there is a variety of service available here, you can take up any and Kṛṣṇa is the centre of that service. That is why, //man-mana bhava mad-bhakto,// he becomes a devotee and the mind is always engaged at the lotus feet of the Lord. For this the Lord himself says this kind of a person who is always thinking of Me, will never be in want of anything. "I will look into his wants Myself!" 

> tesam nityabhiyuktanam
> yoga-ksemam vahamy aham

Whatever necessities they have got, Kṛṣṇa is giving, " here you take it" personally. And actually you can see we have 108 temples all over the world and in each of them never less than 50 devotees but between 200,250 to 300 devotees are there. So you can estimate how many devotees are there in these 108 temples. We have a temple in London, New York. We have two temples in London. Edinburgh, Los Angeles, Boston have our temples. We have 40 temples in America, we have temples in Australia, Canada, everywhere. You can go to any temple and you will see that there is no shortage of any kind. //yoga-ksemam vahamy aham.// This is practical. This is not theoretical that we tell things that are not true. You can go to Bombay and see that although we are under so much pressure, worship and service is going on unhindered. Even if we are not allowed to build a temple, still our worship and service is going on! There is no loss for us but the people who are obstructing will be at a loss, this is definite! This the Lord will never tolerate. 

This must happen in India especially as this is India’s heritage, devotional service. Devotional service is especially found in India that is why even the demigods pray to the Lord that they may take birth in the land India. This is there in the scriptures. India is such a sacred land that those who are born here are ‘naturally devotees’. He is forced to become a non-devotee. Whenever we have performed this //sankirtan// movement in any city, you would have seen like in Bombay What is that place in Cross Maidan we have organized two or three times, around 30000 to 40000 people attended, so is the case in Calcutta and Hyderabad and Madras. So up until now the people of India have not forgotten the devotional service, they are being forced to forget. Do not forget, do not let go otherwise the purpose of your human life will be nullified. If you want to be successful in the human life then we must accept devotional service. 

> bhagavad-bhakti-hinasya
> jatih japas tapah Kriyah
> apranasya hi dehasya
> mandanam loka-ranjanam

For those who are devoid of devotional service, their caste, and //japas tapah austerity,tapasya// and ritualistic activities is like //apranasya hi dehasya mandanam loka-ranjanam,// like decorating a dead body. What is the use of decorating a dead body? Nothing for him nor for anyone else! //Loka-ranjanam,// people watching clap and say look how nicely they have decorated the dead body! But there is no value of this! Similarly you may belong to a high caste, or become a great industrialist or some such thing but if you are not engaged in devotional service then it is like decorating a dead body, that’s all! That is why we must never give up devotional service. 

This Ajamila who was following the instructions of his father //pitr-sandesa-krd dvijah.// This is the quality of a Brahman that the father is performing worship of the Lord and orders the son to organize some flowers and fruits to offer them in the service of the Lord. //Dvijah,// this is the duty of a //dvijah.//

> adaya tata avrttah
> phala-puspa-samit-kusan

And according to the instructions of his father this boy was bringing flowers, fruits and //samit// means Kush (grass) etc from the forest. What did he see on the way? //dadarsa kaminam kancic,// he saw a lusty man. Kami means //sudra.// A //sudra// is lusty. And a Brahman is //sanyami//[?] ...to control the lusty desires. //Shamah// and //Damah,// If a person cannot control his lusty desires then he is a //sudra// and the one who can control is a Brahman, he is a swami, he is a //goswami.// Swami means master and //goswami// means master of his senses. Normally we are the servants of our senses. The tongue is a sense organ and it tells me to smoke a cigarette, as the tongue is dry. So at that very moment I smoke a cigarette. This means that I am the servant of the tongue. 

The tongue is asking for a cigarette and I am also giving it. This means that though I am thinking myself to be independent and master actually I am the servant of the tongue. And if you are not the servant of the tongue then when the tongue tells you to give it a cigarette you will not. Then you are not the servant of the tongue, //godasa// but the master of the senses, //goswami.// Such a person is called a //goswami.// Tongue is a sense organ and it is called ‘go’ and when you are the servant of your senses then you are ‘//godasa//’ and when you are the master of your senses then you are ‘//goswami//’. Goswami does not mean that for name sake you are called a //goswami// but you are the servant of the cigarette. This is not acceptable. Goswami means one who is the master of his senses. The title //goswami// given to //sanyasis// means he is the master of his senses not servant. Here it is said,

> adaya tata avrttah
> phala-puspa-samit-kusan
> dadarsa kaminam kancic

//kaminam!// Lusty man. That means //sudra.// He saw a //sudra.//

> kaminam kvachit shudram
> saha bhujisyaya
> pitva ca madhu maireyam
> madaghurnita-netraya

He saw a lady, //sudrani,// both were drunk, //madaghurnita.// Mad means liquor and the brain was puzzled because of this. 

> pitva ca madhu maireyam
> madaghurnita-netraya

Even the eyes were rolling. They were very drunk on liquor. This kind of activity is encouraged nowadays, please come here to the liquor shop! But these are all activities of a fourth class person. This is the activity for a //sudra// only not the activity of a Brahman. 

> mattaya vislathan-nivya

Their clothes were also loosened.

> vislathan-nivya
> vyapetam nirapatrapam

And they were embracing and kissing each other on a public road, //nirapatrapam,// without any shame.

> kridantam anugayantam

They were thus indulging in these kind of activities and singing songs from the movies. In those days there were no cinemas so they were singing lust invoking songs. And //hasantam,// laughing and smiling and //anayantike,// there were no impediments to their activities. So he saw a //sudra// and a //sudrani.// This Brahman boy was so qualified but despite his qualifications when he saw this scene in front of his eyes, then his mind is perturbed. He is a youth and we shall see in the future verses how this boy will fall down just on account of seeing this scene. And we see this every day. If not in the streets. It is on the streets also and we can see it in the movies. How will the youth be able to stay determined in the //Brahmacharya ashrama?// Impossible! Just by seeing once Ajamila had such a fall down. He became a thief, a dacoit, a cheat and whatever else he could have become he did. Just by seeing once a //sudra// and a //sudrani// embracing each other and we watch this every day in the cinemas and how much we are fallen and how much we are going to fall down, please try to understand this. This is //kaliyuga// so our Indian culture and Vedic traditions, to protect them ordinarily is very difficult. So //kaliyuga// is a disease and we have a medicine for that also! The scriptures say, //kaliyuga// is an ocean of faults, so many faults. This is mentioned in the 12th canto of the //Śrīmad Bhagavatam.// So what is the medicine for this? That is also mentioned. What is that medicine?

> kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann
> asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ
> [SB 12.3.51]

Maharaj Parikshit, the //kaliyuga// is full of faults but there is one great benediction also. What is that? 

> kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya
> mukta-bandhaḥ paraṁ vrajet
> [SB 12.3.51]

Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahamantra// we can be liberated from all our sins and go to Vaikuntha. This is the essence of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. All this degradation that has taken place,

> prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ sabhya
> kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ
> [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]

In Kaliyuga mostly people have short lives and it is further reducing. Slowly it will be so little that if a person lives till he is 20 yrs or 30 yrs he will considered to be an old man. This is written in the scriptures. Now it is 50 or 60 yrs. In India the average age is 35yrs old or something like that. So, //prayenalpayushah,// in this //kaliyuga// men will have short lives. They will not endeavor for liberation or gaining knowledge. So in this situation the scriptures say

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

In //Kaliyuga// if you want any spiritual progress, liberated! Liberated means that this birth, death, old age and disease is not natural phenomenon but unnatural. A living entity is //nitya sasvatam.// He is eternal, everlasting, he will never die. //na hanyate hanyamane sarire,// the destruction of this material body does not result in the destruction of the soul. The soul gets another material body. //Tatha dehantar prapti,// So If me and you all are eternal and the Lord is also eternal, //nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam.// The Lord is also eternal and spirit and we are also eternal and spirit. So the Lord wants that, you who are eternal and do not have any birth and death are now entangled in the cycle of birth and death and need to get out of it- this is called //mukti// or liberation. 

> muktir hitva anyatha rupam sva-rupena vyavasthitih.

This is the explanation of //mukti.// We have forgotten our original constitutional position. Our constitutional position is that we will never die and now we are dying. We give up one body take another one then give that up, among 8400000 species of life. We keep moving about in them. This is our bondage and to get freed from this bondage is //mukti, sva-rupena vyavasthitih.// Constitutional position is that we will never die. 

> janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-
> duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam 
> [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]

Therefore, The Lord says you have solved all other problems but your real problem is birth, death, old age and disease. Solve this! We get 10, 20 or 50 or 100 years maximum and then we have to die and accept another body, this is our real problem. And once we are liberated from this problem then we will not be born nor will we die. One who is not born will not die either! No old age also. Only if we are born will we have these problems. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, this is the teaching of //Bhagavad-gītā,// that you can all be liberated from this birth and death. And how? Only understand Kṛṣṇa, that’s all! This is our only job.

> janma karma ca me divyam
> evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

And Kṛṣṇa, //ajo 'pi sann avyayâtmâ// The Lord says, "Although I am unborn, I am Devakinandana, I am Yasodanandana. There is a reason for this." If we can understand this reason,

> janma karma ca me divyam
> evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

And Kṛṣṇa, //ajo 'pi sann avyayâtmâ// The Lord says, "Although I am unborn, I amWhy does the Lord take the human form and become Devakinandana, Yasonandana and performs His pastimes- try to understand this! //Divyam,// this is //divyam// [transcendental], this is not ordinary. So if anyone understands this

> janma karma ca me divyam
> evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

And Kṛṣṇa, //ajo 'pi sann avyayâtmâ// The Lord says, "Although I am unborn, I amIn reality! So what is his advantage? He is liberated.

> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti mām eti so 'rjuna
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

Then he does not get another material body on leaving his present one. Then where does he go? //Mam eva,// they come to Me in Vaikuntha. Then once you go there,

> yaṁ prāpya na nivartante
> tad dhāma paramaṁ mama
> [[books:bg:8:21|[Bg. 8.21]]]

Once you go to //Vaikuntha// then you do not have to take on another material body, nor come back to this material world. Then his life is full of knowledge and bliss, //anandamayo abhyasat.// So we should try to imbibe this, that is why we have a human body. The human form of life is not Like dogs and sheep for eating, sleeping, enjoying and then dying. This is not the aim of human body. The human body is given so that we can understand God. One day someone was asking me, what is the aim of human life? The aim of human life is to surrender at the lotus feet of the Lord. That’s all. Everything else will be done!

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja

And what is the benefit of doing this?

> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

A person suffers because of his sins, and if one surrenders unto the Lord then he has no suffering.

> ananyāś cintayanto māṁ
> ye janāḥ paryupāsate
> teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ
> yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham
> [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]]

The aim of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that you somehow surrender unto the lotus feet of the Lord. Then all your suffering will be removed and you will have no shortage of anything. We are all working hard to overcome our shortages.

To meet the shortages or wants we work with our mind and senses. //manah-sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati.// This will not work in the material world. Just like there is a man in the jail if he pleases the jail superintendent then his job will not be done and he will not be released till the Government does not give his release orders. So all this struggling we are undergoing in this material world //manah-sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati.//

The Lord says the living entity is a part and parcel of Me, but they want to enjoy this material world with their mind and senses. //manah-sasthanindriyani prakrti-sthani karsati Karsati,// means struggling but he is not happy. How can he become happy? Not by using his intelligence to struggle and try to be happy. Then how will this happen?

Those who by mental concoction plan to find ways to be happy, will never be successful. Because that is the plan of the mind and not of the Lord! And in this material world the plan of the Lord works not my plan or your plan. I have planned that I will have a nice house, big bank balance and that I will never die and I will enjoy all these but the Lord’s plan is you have to die and leave all this behind. So what can you plan? Nothing can be planned! //Sarva haram mrtyuh aham,// the Lord says as death I will snatch everything from you. That’s all! Nothing will go with you. You came like this, you will go like this. You have a material body now and you will get another one, that’s all. This is our plan.

This is Maya’s plan, you cannot overcome it. It is not possible. You may try your best struggle but it is not possible!

> mām eva ye prapadyante
> māyām etāṁ taranti te
> [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]

Those who are devotees of the Lord do not plan. They leave everything to the Lord as his plan alone works and they surrender at the lotus feet of the Lord and leave the planning to the Lord as He wills. 

Thank you very much! Hare Kṛṣṇa!
