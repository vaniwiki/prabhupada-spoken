**Dhanañjaya:**
This morning, the Deities, greeting will be at seven o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Dhanañjaya:**
We will greet the Deities at seven o'clock this morning, so there will be no delay.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I said in America, in nearly all temples, the Deities are greeted at seven o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm. [break] ...speak, why he is purchasing? They will cheat.

**Dhanañjaya:**
He speaks a little Hindi. This is Asita.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[calls to him] Asita. [man talking in Hindi in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
Go on. What is the trouble? See. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
They stop everyone so they can extract taxes from them. They want to stop every single person, even the buffalo carts. [break]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[to Life Member] There was no trouble. It's okay now.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// Thank you.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's a Life Member from Nellore.

**Indian Life Member:**
Nellore, Andhra Pradesh.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He has come to live in our temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he has come?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Indian Life Member:**
I am very fortunate that Swāmījī has come from America. I was inquiring about you all these years. I wanted to come here in April also, when the temple was being opened. At that time I had some work; therefore I couldn't come.

**Prabhupāda:**
What you are doing there?

**Indian Life Member:**
I am retired labor officer in the state government.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So you can live here, retired life?

**Indian Life Member:**
By the grace of your..., and the blessings of your...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You are welcome.

**Indian Life Member:**
I'll be staying here for ten days.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why ten days? Live here for ten years. [laughter]

**Indian Life Member:**
If you please, I have no objections.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we want many educated men to understand this philosophy and preach. People are... Whole world, they are in ignorance, the value of life. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13]. They are accepting this body as self. The whole trouble is there. So-called scientist, philosopher---everyone is thinking, "I am this body," and therefore there is so much trouble. They do not know what he is and what is his goal of life, how life should be molded. No knowledge. Therefore vigorous preaching is required. Our Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is that, that all people are suffering. There is little knowledge in India. So anyone who has taken his birth in India, he should make his life perfect by studying this Vedic literature and then spread the knowledge all over the world. Because they are in ignorance. Here also now they are ignorant. They do not know what is the value of life, thinking like cats and dogs. What is your idea about the value of life?

**Indian Life Member:**
Unless it is very towards God, it is useless.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian Life Member:**
Constant thinking of Him, His lotus feet, it is the only way by which we can get the real benefit of getting this human life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And where is that education?

**Indian Life Member:**
That is real education.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is... But where is that education? There is no such education all over the world.

**Indian Life Member:**
Only great //gurus// like you can enlighten the whole world. Only very rarely such people comes only for the benefit of the people...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right, but those who are leaders, those who are leading the people, they are not interested. They are misleading.

**Indian Life Member:**
You can beg them interest, only if everything nice with you.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside, about fan?] Sometimes this side, sometimes that side. Near the head.

**Indian Life Member:**
I not praising of Swāmījī... I think no..., so many saints are in India, so many great //ṛṣis// are there. Nobody were able to propagate or bring this consciousness among the people of the worlds as you did. It is a great credit to India. That is what I feel personally.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do you think like that?

**Indian Life Member:**
Yes, I feel. In the heart of hearts I feel like that. I am very happy to see you and to have your blessings. And I think that the whole world will be blessed or be benefited by your presence. I think we must take opportunity of utilizing your service and get benefit. That is what I feel.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that every Indian should do like that. I am only one Indian. If I can do as, according to your estimate, so much, so if every Indian does like that...

**Indian Life Member:**
Unless he has been directed by God. He must be [indistinct] His direction.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, God is directing. This is the direction of God.

**Indian Life Member:**
Only through you they will get that. Only people like you can relate with... It is dormant. The soul is there, and it is in a dormant stage. Unless it is kindled, it cannot have light. People like you can kindle it. And it is really our fortune that we are having Swāmījī with us. There was some //ṛṣi.// Even our Samanja Ācārya[?] or his //guru,// they were not able to carry this to outside India. But you are able to, with all your... I think you are... Is it not said that you are an incarnation of God or you are deputy of God, is it?

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Don't say like that.

**Indian Life Member:**
You are deputy of God, and He is making you true. Swāmījī will be staying here for another two months?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I wish to.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Have you seen that land which has been given to us in Nellore?

**Indian Life Member:**
Yes, it is very near to me. You see, in Nellore, one lady has donated about ninety acres of land.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
With a house.

**Indian Life Member:**
With a house which will cost nearly four or five //lakhs// or even more. Yes. Very costly. And they also ...

**Prabhupāda:**
Which season is good? I shall go there.

**Indian Life Member:**
Yes, sir. You are welcome.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When is a good time? When is the weather the best?

**Indian Life Member:**
Best time is September, October. Of course, there will be little rain. In December generally it will be little chill, but not as chill as in the other parts.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what is the best season?

**Indian Life Member:**
Best season, from August to September. That is the best season. And I wish our //gurujī// to visit our temple, Lord of Samhis[?], and you must see.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is that temple?

**Indian Life Member:**
Lord Veṅkaṭeśvara temple. That is the richest temple in the whole world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bālajī?

**Indian Life Member:**
Bālajī.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have seen it.

**Indian Life Member:**
Oh. When did you see?

**Prabhupāda:**
I think when...

**Indian Life Member:**
Last year or...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not two years. A little more than one year. Hmm? [everyone talking at once about rain]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's starting to rain, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we shall return?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can be near the temple...

**Indian Life Member:**
I think rain will not come. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There is one house on that land, isn't there?

**Indian Life Member:**
Yes, yes, one house on the land. And she wants to dedicate all of the property to the author of that books. That is the will.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we shall organize it very nicely.

**Indian Life Member:**
And our Mahāṁśa Swami is taking very much interest. He is often coming to Nellore. [Hindi] Last month the land was registered and the registration took place.

**Brahmānanda:**
In the name of ISKCON?

**Indian Life Member:**
ISKCON.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. It's already done.

**Indian Life Member:**
Registration already done.

**Prabhupāda:**
So in September let us go there.

**Indian Life Member:**
And in October about 16th[?] you can see about Bālajī's festival, about ten [seven?] days.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. It is near?

**Indian Life Member:**
It is about eighty miles from Nellore.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rain is coming?

**Devotees:**
Yes.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We've had a lot of rain this last year, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [heavy wind on microphone] [sound of heavy rain] [indistinct comments by devotees] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
It was raining? That's it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...parikramā?//

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That was to the old Yamunā trail.

**Prabhupāda:**
We can go?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes.

**British devotee (1):**
The Yamunā's only five minutes walk from Raman Reti now, Prabhupāda. It's very nice for swimming. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...able to walk with us, why you have brought him? It will be strain for him.

**Brahmānanda:**
The other day he came on the walk, the first day. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
The sands of Raman Reti where Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma would enjoy Their pastimes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Therefore we have established Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple.

**Dhanañjaya:**
The sands are very fine and soft here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sands are always soft. [break] ...old house. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
...been all jungle like this at one time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Gardens, not jungle.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Not jungle. Forest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Vana// means forest. What is this?

**Dhanañjaya:**
This is garden.

**Prabhupāda:**
Acala-vihāra Gosvāmī. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
...and down here where they're growing about two acres of //tulasī.// They just grow //tulasī// plants for the temples, for Bankibehari and other temples. The fragrance is so nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...built. Nobody living. Only locked.

**Dhanañjaya:**
This is where the gardener keeps his tools. [break] ...in there, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, there. [break] Tired. [break] Now you can take him back. [child crying]

**Dhanañjaya:**
Did the Yamunā River used to...

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know.

**Dhanañjaya:**
...flow in this part?

**Prabhupāda:**
How this building could be constructed? [break] ...a strong-built wall, and the tree has grown from there.

**Dhanañjaya:**
That means it must be very old wall, because now they are not building such strong walls. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Rādhāballabha. [break] Real reminiscence of Vṛndāvana.

**Brahmānanda:**
It's a real what?

**Prabhupāda:**
Reminiscence.

**Brahmānanda:**
In this area? [break] ...in the //Kṛṣṇa// book are like this. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
It's a colony of birds.

**Prabhupāda:**
Babui. They create such nest, hanging nest. It is very nice fiber, fabricated. They know the art, simply by beaks. They have no hand. They want... They work only with the beaks, and you see the workmanship. Is our men going?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes. Because the Yamunā is just close.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Very close down that way. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
Fertile. Very fertile land. [break] ...used for mooring boats.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Perhaps it was used for mooring boats when the river was there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, it is said that Yamunā was navigable river. Hmm?

**Brahmānanda:**
I was just wondering how they were mooring boats to this thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is well.

**Devotee (2):**
There's a frog that lives down there.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think we shall return. I am getting tired. [break] But how strongly built it is. You see? What was the mortar? Mortar, it is called? That is Madana-mohana temple. [break] ...also good //dantana.// They use.

**Dhanañjaya:**
What do they use?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dantana.//

**Dhanañjaya:**
For cleaning teeth?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is good... For those who are soft gum, it is good medicine.

**Devotee (2):**
//Nim// leaves?

**Dhanañjaya:**
No, the sticks, twigs. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...auspicious to see a calf drinking milk?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But there is no milk. [laughter] [break] Somebody should give me daily one fresh //nim// stem. Ask somebody. [break] Everything you have to do?

**Dhanañjaya:**
I can learn from Brahmānanda Mahārāja. I can learn from Brahmānanda how to break it and make it ready.

**Brahmānanda:**
No, no, just bring... Prabhupāda will arrange that. You just bring the branch.

**Dhanañjaya:**
All right.

**Prabhupāda:**
There are so many //nim// trees.

**Harikeśa:**
You were telling us last year about //nim// leaves being very good for the stomach.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Harikeśa:**
Would you like some? We can bring you some //nim// leaves?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, little paste I can take.

**Harikeśa:**
Mash it in like a //nim// chutney.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Mortar and pestle.

**Harikeśa:**
Put anything else in it?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. A small pill. It increases appetite. Which way? This way?

**Harikeśa:**
This way. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...know how to make //khicuṛi?//

**Harikeśa:**
Yes. I made for you in Hawaii.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. So do it today. //Khicuṛi// and eggplant, fried, and some vegetables. That's all. I'll take between one, half past one. So begin about...

**Harikeśa:**
Twelve-thirty?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I shall go this way or that way? Whose, this garden? Where is our temple?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Our temple is behind the trees. [break] Two trees in one. One tree is growing out of the other tree.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Why they have become two? Not from sentiment, but scientific?

**Dhanañjaya:**
The seed must have been deposited in the bark and then taken root.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they are different seed, different tree.

**Brahmānanda:**
Individual.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Individual. And the specific individuality is there in the seed. Even if you grow together they will come differently.

**Brahmānanda:**
Same earth is there, same water, everything same. But the seed is different.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they will say "by chance." Chance theory. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Harikeśa:**
There is also that phenomenon, they say "identical twins." When two brothers are born together they say "identical twins."

**Dhanañjaya:**
Why does that happen, that there are two brothers who are identically looking the same in features?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not difficult. In the same tree, the same semen.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Because the living entity had the same desire? Two living entities having the same desire for the same body?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Hare Rāma. [many people passing by] They are going to take water from Yamunā or some from well?

**Dhanañjaya:**
From a well. There's just a well around the corner.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. They are all going to Yamunā. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
That lady was from Manipur.

**Harikeśa:**
Viśvambhara lives here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...can... Very nice blackboard.

**Brahmānanda:**
//Hut! Hut!//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, just... Why it is thrown away?

**Viśāla:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda.

[children greet Prabhupāda]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
