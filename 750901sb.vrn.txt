**Prabhupāda:**

> tām eva toṣayām āsa

> grāmyair manoramaiḥ kāmaiḥ
> prasīdeta yathā tathā

So, after seeing the woman, he was meditating always, twenty-four hour, about the subject, lusty desires. //Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]. When one becomes lusty, then one becomes lost of all intelligence. The whole world is going on on the basis of these lusty desires. This is material world. And because I am lusty, you are lusty, every one of us, so as soon as my desires are not fulfilled, your desires are not fulfilled, then I become your enemy, you become my enemy. I cannot see you are making very good progress; you cannot see me making very good progress. This is material world: envious, lusty desires, //kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mātsarya.// This is the basis of this material world.

So he became... The training was that he was training to become a //brāhmaṇa, śamo, dama,// but the progress became checked on account of being attached to a woman. Therefore according to Vedic civilization, the woman is accepted as hindrance to spiritual advancement. The whole basic civilization is how to avoid the... Woman... You do not think that only woman is woman. The man is also woman. Don't think that the woman is condemned, man is not. Woman means enjoyed, and man means enjoyer. So this feeling, this feeling is condemned. If I see one woman for enjoyment, so I am man. And if woman also sees another man for enjoyment, she is also man. Woman means enjoyed and man means enjoyer. So anyone who has got feeling of enjoyment, he is considered to be man. So here both sexes meant for... Everyone is planning, "How I shall enjoy?" Therefore he is //puruṣa,// artificially. Otherwise, originally, we are all //prakṛti, jīva,// either woman or man. This is outward dress.

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said,

> apareyam itas tu
> viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām
> jīva-bhūtāḥ mahā-bāho
> yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat
> [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]

The //prakṛti...// We are //prakṛti,// nature, I mean to..., spiritual nature, //parā prakṛti.// The material nature is //aparā prakṛti,// and we living entities, we are trying to enjoy this //prakṛti.// Therefore sometimes the living entity, either man or woman, he is described as //puruṣa. Puruṣa// means the one who keeps the feeling of becoming enjoyer. That is //puruṣa.// So this material world is //prakṛti// and //puruṣa.// It is said in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the instruction of Ṛṣabhadeva, //puṁsaṁ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etat// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. The whole basic principle of materialistic civilization is the attachment between man and woman. //Puṁsaṁ striyā mithunī-bhāva. Mithunī-bhāvam// is sex. And //tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim āhuḥ:// on account of this sex relationship, the man or woman is bound up. //Hṛdaya-granthi. Granthi// means knot, and //hṛdaya// means heart. So the man is thinking of the woman, and the woman is thinking of man. //Hṛdaya granthim āhuḥ.// Then we require material possession: //ataḥ gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This is our material, conditional life.

So this man, although he was being trained up as a //brāhmaṇa,// his attention was diverted all of a sudden by seeing one //śūdra// and //śūdrāṇī// embracing, kissing, talking. So that became his meditation. Instead of meditating on Viṣṇu, he began to meditate on that //śūdrani. Svayam eva toṣayām āsa.// In the first verse, //tan-nimitta-smara vyāja-graha-grasto vicetasaḥ// [[books:sb:6:1:63|[SB 6.1.63]]]. He became mad, //vicetasa,// bewildered, as if haunted by ghost. //Tām eva manasā dhyāyan.// Always meditating, "How shall I get that woman? How shall I please that woman so that she may satisfy my lusty desires?" Therefore //tām eva toṣayām āsa:// "His only business was how to please her." Now they require money. So he was not earning money, but //pitṛyeṇa,// whatever money he inherited from the father's earning... The son generally inherits father's property, and he was the only son. So he was squandering the father's money in that way, just to please that //śūdrāṇī-tām eva toṣayām āsa pitṛyenārthena yāvatā//---as much as possible. If he could get more money, then he would have spent them only for that women. //Grāmyaiḥ. Grāmyair manoramaiḥ.// This word //grāmya// is very significant. //Grāmya// means external, material. //Grāmyair manoramaiḥ.// By the sense gratification, whatever we find very pleasing, that is called //grāmya manorama.// Actually that is not pleasing; that is entangling. But he became entangled. So //grāmyair manoramaiḥ kāmaiḥ.// The basic principle is lust. //Kāmaiḥ prasīdeta yaḥ.// Wanted to satisfy the woman here and there as soon as meets. We can see these examples very often.

Then next step was,

> viprāṁ sva-bhāryām aprauḍhāṁ
> kule mahati lambhitāṁ
> visasarjācirāt pāpaḥ
> svairiṇyāpāṅga-viddha-dhīḥ
> [[books:sb:6:1:65|[SB 6.1.65]]]

There are three kinds of women: //kāmiṇī, svairiṇi// and //puṁścala. Puṁścala. Svairiṇi// means free, freedom. Nobody is controlled. That is called //svairiṇi.// And //kāmiṇī// means to attract, very much attract. And another, //puṁścala//---living with woman, er, man for some time; giving up; again another; again another. That is exemplified by the lightning. You have seen the lightning---immediately, within a second, from this cloud to that cloud, that cloud to that cloud. So they are called //svairiṇi.// So three divisions. Similarly, there are divisions of men also.

So in this way the material world is very, very entangled. And if we become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then we become free from this entanglement. All these criticisms or the divisions are there for //grāmyaiḥ.// Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has advised, //grāma-kathā nā śunibe, bhāla nā khāibe nā bhāla nā paribe.// This is //vairāgya//---"Don't indulge in //grāmya-kathā.//" Therefore we always advise, "Don't read newspaper. Don't read any other book," because it is full of //grāmya-kathā, grāmyaiḥ.// So to avoid it as far as possible. There is no need. What is the news of a //grāmya-kathā// newspaper? The same thing repeated: here there is flood; where there is train disaster; where there is accident; and political, and one politician is giving speech, another politician is giving speech. These are the //grāmya// things.

So we should save ourself. //Grāmyair manoramaiḥ.// These externally very attractive news, we should avoid it completely. We shall simply talk of Kṛṣṇa. That is the safest method. We shall simply talk //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// And //kṛṣṇa-kathā// means what Kṛṣṇa has said. That is //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// Or what is spoken about Kṛṣṇa. So //Bhagavad-gītā// means //kṛṣṇa-kathā// what Kṛṣṇa has said. And //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is also //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// because everything said about Kṛṣṇa. So we don't... We should not indulge in //grāmya-kathā.// That will mislead us. And if we do not indulge in //grāmya-kathā,// but if we make advancement on //kṛṣṇa-kathā,// then we are always situated on transcendental position. We are no more affected by the modes of material nature. //Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. So we should stick to this principle, then we shall be saved. Otherwise, either I become man or woman, we are all condemned because we are implicated with //grāmya-kathā.//

So //grāmya-kathā// should be avoided. The temple is specially meant for //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// Here there is no other business than Kṛṣṇa. Therefore a temple is always transcendental, //nirguṇa. Nirguṇa.// If you live in the forest, that is //sattva-guṇa.// If you live in the city, that is //rajo-guṇa.// And if you live in the brothel or liquor house or gambling house, that is //tamo-guṇa.// But if you live in the temple, that is //nirguṇa. Traiguṇya-viṣaya-vedā nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna.// This is the advice of Kṛṣṇa. The whole world is complicated with the three modes of material nature, and you have to become above this material nature. //Nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna.// So //nistraiguṇya,// how you can become? //Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. Who... [break] [end]
