**Prabhupāda:**
...get money, they will spend it for spoiling himself.

**Nayanābhirāma:**
So I was just wondering if it wouldn't be better if we gave them food and clothing instead of paying them.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they will not work. [break] ...gradually. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [break] Who does not deviate from the instruction of the Lord, he is Āryan. All others, non-Āryan. The Āryans will take the words of God as it is, without any deviation. That is Āryan. An Āryan means advanced, advanced in knowledge, and one who is advanced in knowledge, he is advanced civilized. Rascal fools, how they can be civilized? Everyone is claiming "Āryan," but he does not know what is the business of Āryans. Simply by some bodily feature... The same ignorance---"I am this body." So by the bodily features they settle up: "This is from Āryan family; this is from non-Āryan family." That is good. That is external. Real Āryan means one who is advanced in knowledge and goes by the order of Kṛṣṇa, or God. [aside:] //Jaya.//

**Brahmānanda:**
Adolf Hitler adopted the idea of Āryan, but his criteria for Āryan was one who had blond hair and blue eyes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is bodily. [chuckles] That is another foolishness.

**Nayanābhirāma:**
Also the Iranians, they are saying...

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like we have dress. So this dress of //sannyāsī// is not all. I must be real //sannyāsī//---in knowledge, in education, in behavior, not that... Hitler studies by the dress. That is the foolishness. It is not by the dress, but by the quality. Dress is also required. As I am //sannyāsī,// I cannot dress otherwise. That is also essential. But if one judges, "Here is a //sannyāsī,//" then he'll misled. That is being done. People are being exploited in the dress of a //sannyāsī,// although actually he is not //sannyāsa.// That is also stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:// "A //sannyāsī// or a //brāhmaṇa// will be accepted by the outward feature." If somebody has got a thread only, two paisa–worth, he becomes a //brāhmaṇa.// And when one takes a //daṇḍa,// he becomes a //sannyāsī.// This will be the identification in the Kali-yuga.

**Brahmānanda:**
So the Ramakrishna philosophy...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ramakrishna philosophy is nonsense.

**Brahmānanda:**
I know. [laughter] They say it doesn't matter what kind of dress you wear.

**Prabhupāda:**
But "they say..." They are rascals. They can say anything. //Chagale ki na khaya pagāle ki na bale:// "A madman, what does he not say, and a goat, what does he not eat?" [laughter]

**Brahmānanda:**
That's their philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We have to take philosophy from the //ācāryas. Ācāryopāsanam.// They are not //ācāryas,// neither they follow the //ācāryas.// They do not follow any //ācāryas,// either Śaṅkarācārya or Madhvācārya, Rāmānujācārya. They have their own philosophy. //Ācārya// the Ramakrishna, he used to worship Goddess Kālī. But even they do not do that. Eh?

**Brahmānanda:**
No. They don't even have deity worship even to Goddess Kālī. They are so advanced...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So where they stand? They have no platform.

**Guṇārṇava:**
What do they do, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know.

**Brahmānanda:**
They have one candle.

**Guṇārṇava:**
Oh, yes. I went to that one temple, and they were just playing...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why they have established Ramakrishna's //mūrti?// If they worship candle, then why they install Ramakrishna? That is the flaw. They have no standard of knowledge.

**Guṇārṇava:**
Ānanda Prabhu was mentioning that he was speaking to one of the //sannyāsīs// from the Ramakrishna mission, and they were very concerned, because a lot of their disciples were leaving the mission and joining our Society. They were very concerned. Their Society is not at all expanding. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That was begun long ago. For their hospital, formerly... [bell ringing]

**Viśāla [in distance]:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Retired medical practitioners, they used to join. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. But nobody is joining now. What is this?

**Viśāla:**

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

**[Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth.]**
