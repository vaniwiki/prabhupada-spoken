**Prabhupāda:**
"...bring my property. My property." [laughter] [laughing] "We are one." He thought that he is very good gentleman. [indistinct] property is for //īśvara?// No, he says that "We are one. Your property is my property and my property is my property." [laughter] Dīkṣita's argument is like that: "We are one." So your room is my room; my room is my room. [end]
