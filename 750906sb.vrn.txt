**Prabhupāda:**

> śrī-viṣṇudūtā ūcuḥ
> aho kaṣṭaṁ dharma-dṛśām
> adharmaḥ spṛśate sabhām
> yatrādaṇḍyeṣv apāpeṣu
> daṇḍo yair dhriyate vṛthā

So the conversation between the Yamadūta and Viṣṇudūta... So this material world is for Yamaduta, and the spiritual world is for Viṣṇudūta. We have discussed all these points. So in the material world, more or less, we are susceptible for being punished by the Yamadūtas or Yamarāja. Not all. Who are punishable? They are nondevotees, those who are sinful. So anyone who is not following the principles of religion, they are to be punished, because the human form of life is meant for executing religion---not the animals.

So if we do not follow religious principle, then we are punishable. You cannot escape. Exactly if you do not follow the state laws, then you are punishable, criminal. Similarly, the original law or original controller, the original king, is Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. These rascals, those who manufacture religion, they do not know that religion can be given by Viṣṇu, and we have to satisfy Viṣṇu. Therefore there is //varṇāśrama-dharma:// four //varṇas// and four //āśramas.// The //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// and //brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// This is the conception of human civilization, Āryan civilization. There are Āryans and non-Āryans. //Āryan// means who follow the //varṇāśrama-dharma.// They are Āryans. In India they were following strictly this //varṇāśrama-dharma;// therefore they are Āryans. Not now; formerly they were. Why? By the //varṇāśrama-dharma// one can please the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu.

> varṇāśramācāravatā
> puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān
> viṣṇur ārādhyate puṁsaṁ
> nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]

The aim of human life is to satisfy Viṣṇu. That is Vedic civilization.

> ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā
> varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ
> svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya
> saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam
> [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]

//Saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam.// You are //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha... Varnāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ.// But what is the aim of life? Aim of life is to satisfy the Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu.

But they do not know it. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. At least at the present moment, nobody knows that he has to satisfy the Supreme Lord. That is the aim of life. He does not know. He does not know even what is God. Just like animal. The animal does not know what is God. They are making research what is God, the theosophists, the theologists, making research. God is canvassing, "Here I am, Kṛṣṇa." He comes. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmi// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. When these rascals forget what is God, He comes. And still, they are making research. He is acting as God; He is instructing as God; He is accepted by the //ācāryas// as God; still, these rascals are searching out God. This is their position. Why you are searching out? Here is God. God says, //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ mattaṁ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]], //aham ādir hi devānāṁ maharṣīṇāṁ sa saptasaḥ// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. And still you are searching God? That is the folly. Even God comes before you, and if you are demon, then you cannot understand what is God.

Therefore we have to follow the //ācāryas.// We are ignorant. To become ignorant is not any fault. But when the ignorant thinks that he knows everything, then he's fault. Therefore the ignorant people are advised in the //Vedas, tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham// [MU 1.2.12]. "So I am ignorant, I am fool, I am rascals. I shall remain like that"? No, that is not human life; that is animal life. Animal is also ignorant. A dog, he cannot go to a //guru.// That is not possible. But a human being, he must. //Abhigacchet:// it must. It is not optional, that "I may go or I may not." No, you must. That is the injunction. That is the Vedic injunction. //Ācārya-paramparā. Evam paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. //Rājarṣayaḥ.// Formerly the king was responsible, responsible king. Responsible government means responsible king. So what is the responsibility of the king? The responsibility that all the citizens, all the inhabitants of the state, they should live very comfortably and develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the responsibility of the king. He has to see that everyone is free from anxiety, everyone is feeling secure, everyone has no disease, no mental anxiety, and in peaceful condition they are executing //bhāgavata-dharma.// That is real //dharma, bhāgavata-dharma. Bhāgavata-dharma// means to understand the science of God. That is //Bhāgavata.// And it is advised, //kaumāram ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. //Kaumāra,// from the very boyhood, childhood, one should be instructed and educated about //bhāgavata-dharma.//

//Dharma// means //bhāgavata-dharma.// Otherwise it is not //dharma;// it is cheating. Otherwise, why Kṛṣṇa said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]? Because that is //bhāgavata-dharma.// Bhagavān is speaking. Therefore, what Bhagavān is speaking, that is in relationship with Bhagavān. Therefore it is called //bhāgavata-dharma. Bhāgavata// means in relationship with God, or Bhagavān. //Bhāgavata-śabda// and then //bhāgavata.// That is //dharma.// So //bhāgavata-dharma. Dharma// means //bhāgavata-dharma. Dharma// does not mean I manufacture at my home some religion and it becomes //dharma.// No. That kind of religion is rejected. //Dharmaḥ projjhita kaivato 'tra:// "That kind of cheating religion is rejected." //Projjhita. Prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa ujjhita.// That is not religion. Religion is for... Religion means the relationship between Bhagavān and me, or everything. //Bhāgavata-dharma.//

So the //Bhāgavata-dharma// is spoken by Bhagavān Himself, //Bhagavad-gītā.// So He says that //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. The human society must be divided into four classes: //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// He says. That is //bhāgavata-dharma.// If you abolish this, everyone is //śūdra,// no //brāhmaṇa.// That //brāhmaṇa// means //guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ---guṇa,// quality, and action, not by birth. He never says "by birth." Anyone who is qualified... Just like in ordinary life, any man who is a qualified medical man, he is given the title "doctor," medical practice, not that a doctor's son is necessarily a doctor. Even if he is a son of a doctor, still, he has to be educated as a medical man; then he will be accepted as doctor. This is //bhāgavata-dharma. Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. And in another place it is stated, //yasya hi yad lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ varṇābhivyañjakam// [[books:sb:7:11:35|[SB 7.11.35]]]. It is said by Nārada Muni to Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, //yasya hi yad lakṣaṇaṁ proktam.// There are symptoms that he has... Here are the symptoms of a //brāhmaṇa: satva śama dama titikṣa ārjavaṁ, jñāna-vijñāna āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. So then Nārada Muni said that //yasya hi yad lakṣaṇaṁ proktam:// "In the //śāstra,// as the symptoms are described, if such symptom," //yadi anyatra vidṛśyeta,// "if such symptoms are visible in other place," //tat tenaiva vinirdiśet// [[books:sb:7:11:35|[SB 7.11.35]]], "if the symptoms of a //brāhmaṇa// is found in a place, other place than, either in the //śūdra// family or //vaiśya// family or //kṣatriya// family, then he should be accepted as a //brāhmaṇa.// Similarly if somebody in a //brāhmaṇa// family, his symptoms are like //kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// or //śūdra,// then he should be designated like that." So this is //bhāgavata-dharma,// strictly following the words and the injunction of God. That is //bhāgavata-dharma.// And that is real //dharma.//

So this man deviated from //bhāgavata-dharma.// Therefore he was to be arrested by the Yamadūta for purification. That was his external affair. But by chance, by the grace of the Lord, at the time of his death he chanted "Nārāyaṇa," not exactly meaning the Supreme Lord Nārāyaṇa, but his son's name was Nārāyaṇa. He was thinking that "I am being dragged by the Yamadūta. So my son will save me." Therefore he exclaimed, "Nārāyaṇa, please save me." So he meant his son, but Nārāyaṇa, actual Nārāyaṇa, heard it---"O Nārāyaṇa, please save me." This is the... Nārāyaṇa is so kind that although the name of Nārāyaṇa was called by Ajāmila, meaning his son, still, because he has chanted the name, holy name of Nārāyaṇa, it was immediately taken seriously by Lord Nārāyaṇa, and His order carriers, the Viṣṇudūtas, were sent to save this man. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]].

So this process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice that //svalpam apy asya dharmasya,// even slightly executed in due time... Because the process is we are educating people to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa to practice, so in due time, Hare Kṛṣṇa at the time of death especially, if we can chant this holy name of God, Hare Kṛṣṇa, then our life is successful. So unless we practice, how it will be possible to chant at the time of death? Because at the time of death the whole system, anatomical-physiological system, becomes disturbed, in bewilderedness, in coma, in unconsciousness. But still, if one has practiced, there is possibility of chanting the holy name of the Lord, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa. Then that is success of life. In Bengali there is a proverb, //bhajana kara sādhana kara mūrti jānle haya[?//], that "Whatever you are executing as a //bhajana, sādhana,// that's all right, but it will be tested at the time of your death." It will be test. Just like a parrot is chanting "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa," but when some cat comes in, "//Kaw-kaw-kaw.//" No. Then missing. So parrot life will not help you. You must be really chanting, without any offense. Then it is possibility that at the time of death... Death will be there. You may be very proud of your body, that "I am permanent." No. "As sure as death." And after death you have to change your body. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. That we do not know, what kind of body I will enjoy. "Now I have got //sevjī's// body," that's all right. But your //karma// will decide the next body.

So intelligent person, they should be Kṛṣṇa conscious, //kṛṣṇa-karma,// always engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. Then it is //mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, "One who is always engaged in My service, activities," Kṛṣṇa says, "he comes back to Me." //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. So practice that. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. This life will be finished, and you do not know what kind of body you are going to get next. The best guarantee is that you execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// constantly, remain pure by following the regulative principles, and //satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. Then everything is assured, and your life is successful. At the time of death you go back to home. Just see how Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa, is so kind that because he feelingly chanted at the time of his death, "O Nārāyaṇa, please come and save me..." But he was meaning his son. But Kṛṣṇa did not take that. Just like Pūtanā. Pūtanā wanted to kill Kṛṣṇa. That was his [her] plan. But Kṛṣṇa, because He sucked the breast of Pūtanā, He took him [her] as His mother. This is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa never takes the bad side. Kṛṣṇa takes always the bright side. Pūtanā, although she came to cheat Kṛṣṇa, but how Kṛṣṇa will cheat? Kṛṣṇa thought that "I have sucked her breast, so she is My mother. She should go to the same place where Yaśodāmayi is going." This is Kṛṣṇa.

So we should always remember that Kṛṣṇa is very, very kind, and a slight devotional service to Him will please Him. Therefore He is begging, //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. What you will give to Kṛṣṇa? He is self-sufficient. But if you give something to Kṛṣṇa, your life becomes successful.

Thank you very much.
