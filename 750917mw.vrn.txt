**Dhanañjaya:**
...at midday. He said we should also fast this morning. In fact, he said we should really fast all day and break the fast at moonrise.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Harikeśa:**
He said that?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Is that right? Until this evening?

**Harikeśa:**
No. He didn't say that.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Oh. What did he say? He said fast all day.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, no. Harikeśa said that.

**Brahmānanda:**
On our calendar it says tomorrow is //Vāmana...//

**Harikeśa:**
Tomorrow is //Vāmana-dvādaśī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
You can come back, half past six, in my room.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
