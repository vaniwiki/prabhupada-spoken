**Prabhupāda:**
All right. //Sāṅketyam,// "indication."

Everyone should know, //viduḥ.// Generally we do not know what is the power of //vaikuṇṭha-nāma.//

Caitanya Mahāprabhu regretted that the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that all the potencies or all the energies in the Absolute Person, the same thing you'll find in His name, in His form, but these things are not understood by less intelligent class of men. To understand these things means to know Kṛṣṇa in truth.

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

This is //tattva,// truth, that Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person, His holy name, His form, His attributes, His pastimes, His paraphernalia, His //dhāma...// Just like we are in Vṛndāvana-dhāma. So why Vṛndāvana-dhāma is worshiped? Because the Vṛndāvana-dhāma is not different from Kṛṣṇa. When you take little dust of Vṛndāvana-dhāma and take it, that means you are taking the dust of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, and you take it. Vṛndāvana-dhāma, so important.

So Vṛndāvana-dhāma, ordinary man cannot see. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says,

> rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhabo śrī yugala-pīriti

> viṣaya chādiyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana
> kabe hāma herabo śrī-vṛndāvana

Vṛndāvana, if you come from anywhere by the train and aeroplane and see Vṛndāvana, that is not seeing Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana-seeing means,

> viṣaya chādiyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana
> kabe hāma herabo śrī-vṛndāvana

When we shall be free from //viṣaya... Viṣaya// means //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. So who can give up //viṣaya// unless it is a great devotee? Others cannot. //Viṣaya,// it is very difficult. But if one is advanced devotee---//paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 2.59]]]---they can give up. So if you come to Vṛndāvana and arrange for a //viṣaya-bhoga//---//āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam//---then Vṛndāvana is far away. //Viṣaya chādiyā.// The whole Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is on the basis of //viṣaya chādiyā.// And Śrī Locana dāsa Ṭhākura also sings, //viṣaya chādiyā se rase majiyā, mukhe bolo hari hari. Viṣaya chādiyā.// If... Of course, in the beginning it is not possible, but the ultimate goal of life is to give up //viṣaya//---no more //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna.// That is called //viṣaya chādiyā.//

Just like Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī did. He came here, lived in Vṛndāvana. He was a very, very rich man's son. Five hundred years ago his father's income was twelve //lakhs// of rupees. Now it may be //crores// of rupees. Five hundred years... He was such a rich man's son. And very beautiful wife. Because Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī was restless, he was always trying to go with Caitanya Mahāprabhu, so his father and uncle---he was the only son of these two brothers---so they thought that "This boy is very restless. He wants to go away with Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Let him have a very nice, beautiful wife and he'll be attracted." But he was not attracted. He was not even going inside the house. He was lying down outside the house, young man. He had no taste for //viṣaya. Viṣaya chādiyā.// Therefore later on he became Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. Formerly he was simply Raghunātha, and when he joined Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then he became Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī.

So he was eating... He was living in Rādhā-kuṇḍa, you know, all //vṛndāvana-vāsīs.// He was eating every alternate days a little butter. That's all. So //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna. Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau.// This is... The more you have become free from //nidrā,// means sleeping; //āhāra,// eating; and //vihāra,// sex; and... //Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi.// And so far //bhaya,// a devotee is not fearful of anything.

> nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve
> na kutaścana bibhyati
> svargāpavarga-narakeṣu...
> narakeṣu api tulyārtha-darśinaḥ
> [[books:sb:6:17:28|[SB 6.17.28]]]

A devotee is not interested whether he is going to hell or heaven. Everything is, for him... He knows hell is also kingdom of God and heaven is also kingdom of God. There... A devotee's kingdom of God means where he gets the chance of serving the Lord. That is wanted.

So //sāṅketyam.// Therefore in the Hindu families they keep the name of the children with the God's name. Just like this Ajāmila, although he was a very, very sinful man, still, because the culture was there, he kept his son's name Nārāyaṇa. He did not lose the culture, although he was so much sinful. The culture is so important. Still in India, as there is very, very good propaganda to make the people godless atheist, still, you see, find, in Vṛndāvana thousands and //lakhs// of people are coming. It is their birthright. Not only in Vṛndāvana; we have seen wherever we held that Hare Kṛṣṇa festival, thousands of men were coming, even the so-called educated. When we held that ceremony in Delhi, L.I.C. Ground, many, many secretaries, officers, they came, and they were dancing with their hat-coat-pant. So it is so nice. So some way or other, if you be in touch with this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, then your life is successful.

//Sāṅketyam.// You keep your children's name just like he kept, "Nārāyaṇa." He actually became delivered because he kept his son's name Nārāyaṇa. //Sāṅketyaṁ pārihāsyam.// Joking. Sometimes they joke: "Oh, these people are chanting 'Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa,' " and they joke also, "Hare Kṛṣṇa!" sometimes seriously, sometimes joking. So joking, they are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa---that is taken to their credit, although he is joking; he is not serious. //Sāṅketyaṁ pārihāsyaṁ stobham.// Sometimes we make fun. To complete one sentence sometimes we, "Hari," "Kṛṣṇa," we add it. So that is also accepted. And then //helanam eva vā. Helanam eva vā.// Just like sometimes in the Western countries there is propaganda, as it was in Germany. Now they are going in Japan: "These Hare Kṛṣṇa people are very bad." But he's chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. While saying that "Hare Kṛṣṇa people are very bad," but the "Hare Kṛṣṇa" is chanted. The //helanam eva vā.// And that is going to their credit. Although they are going to say... Just like "//Rāma chor nāhe,//" and somebody heard, "//Nāhe Rāma chor.//" So "//Rāma chor,//" but because he uttered the name Rāma, even he says, "//Rāma chor,//" he gets the benefit. Sometimes they joke, "Kṛṣṇa is Mākhanchor." So he is accusing "//chor,//" but because he is chanting "Kṛṣṇa" he is getting the benefit.

So some way or other... //Yena tena prakāreṇa manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet// [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.4]. This is the process. Somehow or other, you engage your mind in Kṛṣṇa. //Yena tena prakāreṇa.// Without any regulative principle? Yes. //Sarve vidhi-niveṣedhāḥ syur etayor eva kiṅkarāḥ.// If you some way or other think of Kṛṣṇa, then the //vidhi-niṣedhā, vidhi-niṣedhā,// regulative principle and forbidden things... Just like we have got our regulative principle that "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// at least sixteen rounds." This is called //vidhi.// And //niṣedhā:// "Don't have illicit sex, don't eat meat, don't have intoxication, don't indulge in gambling." These are //niṣedhā.// So //sarve vidhi-niṣedhāḥ syur etayor eva kiṅkarāḥ.// As soon as you go on chanting the holy name of the Lord, //vidhi,// sixteen round, this //niṣedhā// will automatically follow. //Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. This is the process.

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛt-satām
> [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]

This is the process. Somehow or other, //yena tena prakāreṇa,// you think of Kṛṣṇa, you chant Kṛṣṇa's name, you just offer your obeisances, and...

This temple is here. There are many temples. What is the process? Process... If somebody comes here, he immediately think of Kṛṣṇa. By seeing Kṛṣṇa's Deity... Kṛṣṇa's Deity and Kṛṣṇa is not different. So even if he thinks that it is some stone Deity, but Kṛṣṇa's stone Deity... Therefore "Kṛṣṇa's," he says---that will benefit him. Some way or other, he is chanting "Kṛṣṇa." "Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma is very nice in this temple." So that "Kṛṣṇa" and seeing Kṛṣṇa, thinking of Kṛṣṇa, chanting Kṛṣṇa... //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. And if you worship Kṛṣṇa, offer //ārātika, bhoga,// decorate with flowers: //śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan mandira-mār// Even you wash this temple, you get the benefit. Somehow or other be in touch with this temple, with the holy name, with the Vaiṣṇava. In this way, by constant association---//saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ//---by association of devotees, you become a Kṛṣṇa devotee.

Actually it is happening. In your country, the Europeans and Americans, say, ten years before the beginning of this movement, you did not know Kṛṣṇa, every one of you. That's a fact. How you are now mad after Kṛṣṇa? It is simply because by association. So association is so important thing. You boys and girls in your country, you were so luxuriously living. Why you have left everything and you are after a beggar //sannyāsī?// It is the association. The association is so strong. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says,

> tāṅdera caraṇa-sevi-bhakta-sane vās
> janame janame mor ei abhilāṣ

"Let me engage myself in the service of the Gosvāmīs and associate with the devotees. I do not want anything." //Janame janame mor ei abhilāṣ.// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura said that //kīṭa-janma hau, jathā tuwā dās.// This association. "Let me become a worm---not a devotee, even worm." //Kīṭa. Kīṭa// means worm, insignificant ant, worm. "Better to remain as an ant with the association of devotees than to become a Brahmā without any devotee's association." //Brahmā-janme nāhi mora āś. Bahir-mukha brahmā-janme, nāhi mora āś, kīṭa janma hau, jathā tuwā dās.// This is Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's hankering. So some way or other, we are propagating this association, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. Why? Why we are establishing so many centers? Just to give the people in general the chance of association. It is very important thing, association. //Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ.//

So either //kāma// or //lobha// or //bhaya// or enviousness, some way or other connect with Kṛṣṇa. Just like the //gopīs.// The //gopīs,// they liked Kṛṣṇa. They did not know that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. They did not know. They liked Kṛṣṇa. He was a very funny boy, young boy, very beautiful, and these girls were attracted. They went to Kātyāyanī: "Mother Kātyāyanī, please give Kṛṣṇa as our husband." Their only prayer was that. They did not go to Kātyāyanī for begging //dhanaṁ dehi, rūpaṁ dehi, yaśo dehi//---no. "Give me Kṛṣṇa. Give me Kṛṣṇa." So there is no harm to worship the deity, I mean to say, other demigods. But that is not possible for anyone. That was possible only for the //gopīs,// because they did not know anything except Kṛṣṇa. Wherever they go, they want Kṛṣṇa.

But we worship demigods not for Kṛṣṇa---for my sense gratification. //Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñāna yajanty anya-devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]. When we worship any other demigods... Just like you worship Gaṇeśa for //siddhi, ṛddhi-siddhi.// You will find in mercantile shop, //namo gaṇeśāya namaḥ ṛddhi-siddhi kurdan mile//[?]. So similarly, we worship Goddess Durgā for beautiful wife. These are prescribed in the //śāstras,// that "If you want this, then you worship this deity. If you want this, then you worship this deity." So different worshipers of demigods, they are meant for satisfying the senses. But Kṛṣṇa is not that. You cannot satisfy your senses by worshiping Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Kṛṣṇa is not order-supplier: "My dear Kṛṣṇa, please give me this. Then I shall worship You." Kṛṣṇa does not accept such worship. Kṛṣṇa said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You first of all surrender to Me. I am not your order-supplier." This is Kṛṣṇa's worship. So those who are not taking Kṛṣṇa as order-supplier, those who are accepting Kṛṣṇa as order-carrier, he will be successful. Otherwise, it will take time. Don't take Kṛṣṇa as your order-carrier..., order-supplier. You become. //Hṛṣīkena-hṛṣīkeśa sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Bhakti// means when you engage your senses for satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. That is //bhakti.// And if you take Kṛṣṇa for satisfying your senses, just like you worship other demigod, that is not //bhakti.// That is not //bhakti.//

So //helanam eva vaikuṇṭha-nāma-grahaṇaṁ aśeṣāgha-haraṁ viduḥ.// So some way or other, if we are engaged in chanting the //vaikuṇṭha-nāma... Vaikuṇṭha-nāma.// Vaikuṇṭha is Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu. //Vigata-kuṇṭhād yasmād iti vaikuṇṭha.// Here in the material world you are always filled up with //kuṇṭha,// anxieties. And if you go to Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa, then there is no more //kuṇṭha//---full freedom, without anxiety. Because even if you realize yourself that you are part and parcel of Para-brahman, when you realize Brahman yourself, not this body, immediately you become jolly. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. There are many //sannyāsīs// who are //brahmavādī.// So as soon as they feel "//Ahaṁ brahmāsmi,//" they are no more in anxiety of this material world. And if you increase that---Brahman, Paramātmā, Bhagavān... That simple Brahman realization, it is knowledge that "I am not this, but I am that." //Neti.//

But that knowledge will not be sufficient. You have to make progress further, because we are by nature //ānandamāya. Ānanda-mayo 'bhyāsāt.// Our nature is to search after //ānanda.// So simply Brahman realization will not give you //ānanda.// Therefore we see sometimes big, big //sannyāsīs,// they gave up this world as //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā,// but because they could not get //ānanda,// they come down again. Again they become busy in opening hospital and school and philanthropic work, politics, because they could not get //ānanda.// That is the defect of the impersonalist. They can simply understand //ahaṁ brahmāsmi:// "I am not this body. I am not matter. I am spirit." But that much understanding will not help. It may be helpful for some time, but because he is bereft of //ānanda,// he will fall down. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]].

//Ānanda// you cannot get without being a servant of the Supreme Lord. That is //ānanda,// reciprocation. That is Vṛndāvana. There is //ānanda, cinmāya, ānanda,// because everyone is engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa. The cowherd boys, the calves, the cows, the birds, the beasts, the trees, the water, the father, mother, playmates---everyone---Kṛṣṇa is the center. That is //ānanda.// And if you make Kṛṣṇa minus, then there is no //ānanda.// You may be Brahman realized, you may be seeing the Paramātmā, but there is no //ānanda.//

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
