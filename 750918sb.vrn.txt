**Prabhupāda:**

> patitaḥ skhalito bhagnaḥ
> sandaṣṭas tapta āhataḥ
> harir ity avaśenāha
> pumān nārhati yātanāḥ
> [[books:sb:6:2:15|[SB 6.2.15]]]

These are the..., some of the practical examples. There are persons who criticize chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra. Nāmnād artha-vāda.// Because the glories of the holy name are described here, that one can become free from the sinful reaction of life simply by chanting the holy name of the Lord, so sometimes those who are not in the line, they think, "It is too much. It is too much." So the next verse, the... It is advised... Not it is too much. You can test it. Test it. What is that test? //Patita.// When you fall down from a high place... Suppose from the roof you may fall down, //patitaṁ. Skhalita:// you may slip and fall down. //Bhagnaḥ:// by falling down you may break your bones. Then //sandaṣṭaḥ:// you may be bitten by some animals---cats, dogs, a snake. There are so many, domestic. Then //tapta:// you may be burned. And //āhata:// you may be injured from others. Then during this time you can test, practical. What is that test? //Harir ity avaśena aha.// Try to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Pumān.// If anyone does so, //na arhati yātanāḥ.// You'll immediately feel that from the injuries you are not feeling pain. This is practical seen. Even a snakebite, you may be saved. The author says..., never says that you may be saved from death, but the suggestion is that you may not feel much pain. This is practical.

Because this material world is full of dangers, these symptoms of dangerous position, //patitaṁ skhalito bhagnaḥ...// Especially in the modern age, in the Western countries, accident, motor accident, and die is very common thing nowadays. Here also it is becoming. On the whole, even there is no motor accident, there are so many accidents. In every step there is danger. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām// [SB 10.14.58]. This material world means every step there is danger---there is no question of safety---at any moment. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja recommended, //kaumāraṁ ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha.// Why in the beginning of childhood one should learn //bhāgavata-dharma? Durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma.// Somehow or other, we have got this body, human form of body, //durlabham,// after many, many births. They do not know. The foolish person, they do not know what is the value of this human form of life. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāni sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati, kṛmayo rudra-saṅkhyatāḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. In this way 8,400,000 different forms of life we have to pass through. Then we have got this... Especially a civilized human being. The human race, they are also 400,000, 400,000 types. Out of them, those who are civilized, they are called Āryans. Āryan means civilized. Āryan means those who are making progress. They are called Āryans.

So amongst the Āryans there is the division---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha.// The Āryans, they do follow it, these Vedic principles, //varṇāśrama-dharma. Varnāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān, viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. What is the purpose of //varṇāśrama?// Now, //viṣṇu ārādhana.// "Why Viṣṇu //ārādhana?// There are so many other demigods." That is also answered by Lord Śiva. When he was asked by Pārvatī, "What is the best form of worship?" he recommended, //ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣām:// "There are many different types of worship." //Sarveṣam. Viṣṇur ārādhanaṁ param.// He never said, Lord Śiva, that "My //ārādhana// is..." Kṛṣṇa says, //mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], but no other demigod has ever said. No. You'll never find. Here Lord Śiva says, //viṣṇur ārādhanaṁ param.// Then again he stresses, //tasmāt parataraṁ devī madīyānāṁ, tadīyānām ārādhanam// [Padma Purāṇa]: "//Viṣṇu-ārādhanam// is the best, but better than this best there is another //ārādhanam.//" What is that? //Tadīyānām ārādhananam:// "To worship Vaiṣṇava." //Viṣṇu-ārādhana// is the topmost, but //vaiṣṇava-ārādhana// is still more. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore says, //chādiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā, nistara payeche kebā.// The //vaiṣṇava-ārādhana// is so important.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ
> jñāninās tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

//Tattva-darśi.// This word //tattva// is very important. Unless one is //tattva-darsi,// there is no use to take instruction from him. Useless waste of time. //Tattva-darśi// means... Kṛṣṇa says in another place, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. //Siddhi// means liberated, means who has no more the bodily concept of life. This is the Vedic meaning of //ahaṁ brahmāsmi. Aham:// "I, the spiritual spark, I am not this matter. I am a spirit soul." That is //brahmāsmi.// So long we are in the bodily concept of life, that is called //jīva-bhūta//---//mamivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ//---conditioned soul. And when one understands //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// that is called //brahma-bhūta.// There are two words. The conditioned soul is called //jīva-bhūta.// He is thinking, "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //kṣatriya,//" "I am cat," "I am dog," "I am this," "I am that." That is called //jīva-bhūta.// And in the human form of life, when he studies //athāto brahma jijñāsā,// when he is inquisitive to understand Brahman, spirit, that is real life. //Jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.//

In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said that //dharmārtha-kāma-mokṣa// [[books:sb:4:8:41|[SB 4.8.41]]]. So //mokṣa// means //tattva-jijñāsā. Jīvasya tattva-jijñāsa na yas ceha karmabhiḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:10|[SB 1.2.10]]]. So that //tattva-jijñāsā// means to understand Kṛṣṇa. You'll find in the //Bhagavad-gītā, kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. The same. //Tattva-jijñāsā...// Who will inquire about //tattva?// Those who are //siddha.// So that //siddha// stage, //brahma-bhūta// stage, is not for everyone. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye.// Out of many millions of persons, one may be interested how to become //siddha,// to understand //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// That is called //siddha.// And //yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. This is called //tattva-jijñāsā.// So //tattva-jijñāsā// is meant for the //siddhas,// not for the fools and rascals. They cannot. They are inquiring, [Hindi?]. You find in the market, big, big merchants, they have got exchange in Calcutta, Bombay. The inquiry is //ke apa haya.// So not that inquiry. //Ke apa haya,// share-cut //ke apa haya, cao ke apa haya, dal ke apa haya.//[?] Not... That is not //tattva-jijñāsā. Tattva-jijñāsā// means "What is Brahman?" That is //tattva-jijñāsā,// because //Vedas// indicates that "Try to understand //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// 'You are Brahman.' " //Tat tvam asi. So 'ham.// So this is the Vedic injunction.

So the Vedic injunction, //tattva-jijñāsā,// that is the first aphorism in the //Vedānta-sūtra. Athāto brahma-jijñāsāḥ:// "The human form of life is meant for inquiring about the Absolute Truth." Therefore //Bhāgavata// explains, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.// That is the explanation of //Brahma-sutra.// Therefore you will find at the end of each chapter of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, śrīmad-bhāgavate mahā-purāṇe brahma-sutra-bhasye.// The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the real comment on //Brahma-sutra, Vedānta-sūtra. Vedānta-sūtra// was compiled by Vyāsadeva. He summarized all the Vedic knowledge, summarized all Vedic knowledge into //Brahma-sutra,// in nutshell. Then he was not satisfied, although he made so many //Purāṇas, Mahābhārata, Brahma-sutra, Upaniṣads// and... Means these were correct. He wrote into letters in the book. Being compassionate on the people of this age, all fools and rascals---they have no good memory---therefore he compiled all these //Vedas// into writing. Before that, there was no writing. People were so sharp in memory, simply by hearing from the //guru,// they will remember. Simply. The education and the brain and the capacity was so nice. So that is not possible in the age. Everything is diminishing. The strength, bodily strength, is diminishing. The memory is diminishing. The duration of life is diminishing. Man's propensity to be merciful is diminishing. At the present moment, even in the civilized world, so-called civilized, if one man is being killed on the open street, nobody will go and help him, because the tendency for showing mercy to others, that is diminishing. And bodily strength is diminishing. Memory is diminishing. //Dharma,// the principle of religion, that is diminishing. This is calculated. Therefore //brahma-jijñāsā.//

When Caitanya Mahāprabhu was questioned by Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī at Benares, follower of Śaṅkara philosophy, that... There was meeting between Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like to meet the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs.// He used to live alone. But sometimes these Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// they were criticizing Him that "This Bengali //sannyāsī// comes from Bengal, and He does not indulge in reading //Brahma-sutra// or //Vedānta-sūtra.// He dances and chants with some ecstatic people. What kind of //sannyāsī// He is? A //sannyāsī// is meant for studying //Vedānta-sūtra,// Sāṅkhya philosophy." Some of them were very learned scholars. There's no doubt about it. But when Caitanya Mahāprabhu was inquired by Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, "Sir, I learned that in Your previous life..." He was a learned scholar. He was known as Nimāi Paṇḍita. "And You have taken //sannyāsa.// So instead of reading Sāṅkhya philosophy and //Vedānta-sūtra,// You are simply chanting and dancing with some fanatics. What is this?" This was the question. Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied that "Sir, if I reply your question candidly, please do not be sorry." "No, I am not sorry. We are prepared." "Because My Guru Mahārāja saw Me: I am the greatest fool." //Guru more mūrkha dekhi, karila vedanta nāhi tava adhikāra// [[books:cc:adi:7:71|[Cc. Ādi 7.71]]]. He became a fool. The purpose was that at the the present moment they are simply fools and rascals. What they will understand about //Vedānta?// Therefore the śāstric injunction is //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam.//

So there was very long discussion, and all the //sannyāsīs,// sixty thousand //sannyāsīs,// they were convinced about Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy, His explanation of the //Upaniṣad.// So it is not that the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //sampradāya// is simply chanting and dancing. If required, they are prepared to answer all Vedic discussion. They are prepared. We have got so many books, all Vedic discussion. Not that we are simply indul... But this is sufficient. Simply chanting is sufficient. But if one thinks like Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, that "These people simply chant and dance..." Sometimes one //sannyāsī// accused us like that. Germany or some...? That Bharati? So we answered them that "Come on. We have got at least seventy-five books, four hundred pages each, to teach you Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Come on." So we are prepared. It is not that. We are the followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He was chanting and dancing, but when there was Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, when there was Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, He discussed //Vedānta// very elaborately, not with fools and rascals. A //paṇḍita// like Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, a //sannyāsī// like Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī who knew what is //Vedānta,// what is //Vedas//---then we are prepared, because we know certainly. Kṛṣṇa says, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. If anyone understands Kṛṣṇa, it is to be understood that he has studied all the //Vedas.// There is no doubt about it. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam.//

> bahūnāṁ janmanām ante
> jñānavān māṁ prapadyate
> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti
> sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ
> [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]

So everything is explained there. We are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness not with empty hand. We are prepared to talk on //Vedānta.// We are prepared to talk on //Upaniṣad.// And the conclusion is, //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam. Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaṁ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. This is the conclusion. Kṛṣṇa also confirms that //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjayaḥ, praṇava// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. Sometimes they take //praṇavaḥ// as the Supreme. Kṛṣṇa says, //praṇavaḥ ahaṁ sarva vedeṣu:// "This //praṇava, oṁkāra,// in all the //Vedas,// that is I am. That is My sound representation." So this holy name of Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that simply by chanting, one can become liberated. This is the blessing of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He said, //ihā haite sarva siddhi haibe tomāra.// All //siddhis. Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. //Siddhi// means to cleanse the heart. That is //siddhi.// Because we are now materially obsessed, we are thinking, "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am this and that," all material---//upādhi.// And //bhakti// means when you are freed from the //upādhi,// then //bhakti// begins.

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

Then //bhakti// begins. //Bhakti// is not for the person who is not liberated, because as soon as you begin //bhakti,// devotional service, you immediately you come to the liberated platform. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> māṁ cāvyabhicāriṇi
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇan samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

//Bhakti,// beginning of //bhakti,// means immediately he is on the Brahman platform. We are trying to understand //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// but if you take to devotional service you are immediately on the platform of //brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.//

So this is the scientific understanding of //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage, or //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// and... Everything is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So therefore this name is Brahman. The holy name of Lord is Brahman, Brahman's name. Brahman's name means Brahman. Because Brahman is Absolute, He is not different from His name, He is not different from His form, He is not different from His quality. Otherwise how we are worshiping this form of Kṛṣṇa here? This Kṛṣṇa and that Kṛṣṇa... There is no "this" and "that." Kṛṣṇa is one. But even if we think that this is the statue of Kṛṣṇa, that is our misconception. It is not statue. It is Kṛṣṇa. But we have to prepare our eyes to see. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. When He entered Jagannātha temple, He immediately fainted---"Here is Kṛṣṇa. Here is Kṛṣṇa"---because He had the eyes to see Kṛṣṇa. So we have to prepare our eyes to see. That eyes is also explained in the //Brahma-saṁhitā: premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38], to develop your love of Kṛṣṇa. Then Kṛṣṇa will be revealed. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [Brs. 1.2.234].

So you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa by argument or by your these staring eyes. No. You have to prepare your eyes, you have to prepare your ear, you have to prepare your nose, you have to prepare your tongue, you have to prepare your hand, you have to prepare your leg---all the senses.

> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalaṁ
> hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

These senses, now it is //upādhi.// I am thinking, "I am American; therefore my hand is American, my leg is American, my eyes are American." No. You have to become free from these "American eyes" or "Indian eyes" or "brahminical eyes" or... No. Pure eyes. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.// When your eyes are purified from all these designation, when your senses are purified, then //nirmalaṁ. Nirmalam// means purified. That senses... Purification does not mean that you are senseless. No. Just like cataract operation of the eyes does not mean pluck out the eyes. No. The eyes will remain; the cataracts will be taken away. Then you will see. So when your material conception of life is finished, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// That is called //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// And to simply realize //ahaṁ brahmāsmi// will not stay. You have to go further.

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

If you make further advance, then your Brahman activities will begin, and that is called //bhakti, parā-bhakti.//

Thank you very much.
