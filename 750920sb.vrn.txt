So yesterday we have explained that we are put into such position in this material world that we have to commit sinful activities. This is our position. Even if I do not want to do it... Just like a man accustomed to steal, he is dictated from within, "Don't steal." Otherwise why he goes at night to steal? He knows that "This is not good." He does not steal openly. Secretly, without any knowledge. Because he knows that "What I am going to do is not good." That's a fact. Therefore sometimes it is called black. So he is forced to do it.

It was questioned by Arjuna to Kṛṣṇa that "How one man is forced to commit sinful activities?" So Kṛṣṇa replied, //kāma eṣa krodha eṣa rajo-guṇa-samudbhavam// [[books:bg:3:37|[Bg. 3.37]]]. There are three modes of material nature: //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// So those who are in //tamo-guṇa// and //rajo-guṇa,// they are forced to commit sinful activities, forced. There is no alternative. Therefore we have to come. Just like we go to school, college for education. What is the purpose? That "We are ignorant. We are illiterate, uneducated. Therefore I must go to school to learn, to become enlightened." Similarly, from the lower animal status we are coming by evolution, and in the human form of life, especially in the civilized human form of life, the enlightenment is that one should come from this //tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// to //sattva-guṇa.// That is required. Therefore the brahminical culture is so much adored in India to make one from the lower status of life to the higher status of life. And that is very easily done simply by devotional service.

That is stated here: //na adharmajaṁ dhṛdayam.// Our heart is filled up with all dirty things, //adharmajaṁ.// And it is very difficult to purify the heart. But it is possible, //tad api.// Even the hard-hearted, stone-hearted, //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa,// can be melted, can be reformed. How? //Īśāṅghri-sevayā. Īśa. Īśa// means the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa; //aṅghri// means His lotus feet. //Sevayā.// This is possible. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also, Kṛṣṇa says the same thing. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. //Pāpa-yoni. Puṇya-yoni// means according to the infection of the heart with different qualities of these material modes of nature. That is called //pāpa-yoni.// One whose heart is too much engrossed with //tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa,// they are lower grade, //pāpa-yoni.// And gradually, one who is free from the //tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa...// Even //sattva-guṇa.// Of course, //sattva-guṇa// is taken the platform of goodness. That is the only hope in this material world, that one has to come by endeavor to the //sattva-guṇa// platform. Then the heart disease, //kāma..., hṛd-roga-kāma.// It is a heart disease. //Kāma// means lusty desires simply to enjoy senses. This is called //kāma. Hṛd-roga-kāma āpṛṇoti.//

So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to cure the heart disease full with lusty desires. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And the perfection comes when //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ// [Brs. 1.1.11]---no more any material desire. That is possible. //Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ// [[books:bg:6:20-23|[Bg. 6.22]]]. If you get something, that something, //yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ,// you are full satisfied that "I don't want anything more." //Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]], Dhruva Mahārāja said. He went to the forest to undergo severe austerities so that he can see Nārāyaṇa and beg some benefit, to get a greater kingdom than his father. He was insulted by his stepmother, so the boy, son of a //kṣatriya,// he determined that "I shall have a better kingdom than my father." So he got it. By Kṛṣṇa's grace he got it, that Dhruvaloka, the polestar. It is very big star. So he went for this purpose. //Arthārthī. Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino arjuna// [[books:bg:7:16|[Bg. 7.16]]]. //Arthārthī. Ārto arthārthī.// So he was in search after money, Dhruva Mahārāja, and therefore at five years old he went to the forest. His mother advised that "Kṛṣṇa can help you only." Others cannot help.

So he was simple boy. He decided, "Where is Kṛṣṇa?" "Now, my dear child, I know that He is found in the forest." So he went to the forest, and he very severely... Nārada Muni tried to persuade him, "No, no, you are simply a small child. Why you are so much infected with the insult given by your stepmother?" So he said, "No, I don't want your advice. If you can give me God, just talk of that. You don't talk of compromise. I am not going." This is determination. This is determination. So he, actually, within six months he saw Nārāyaṇa. But when he saw Nārāyaṇa, then his all material desires finished. He said, //svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]]: "I came to ask You for some benefit, material benefit. Now, by seeing You I am so satisfied that I have no more any desire to ask for." This is the ultimate stage: no more desire. We may begin with desire, but perfection is that when there is no more desire. That is the beginning of //bhakti.//

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ
> bhaktir uttama
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

That is //bhakti,// no more desire.

So here, //na adharmajaṁ tad-dhṛdayam. Adharmajam.// So long our heart is compact with material desires, we have to take birth after birth to fulfill that desire. It is automatical. So how to become desireless? Not desireless, but no material desire. There is desire---to go back to home, back to Godhead. That is natural. That is natural. To become a devotee, to desire like that, that is wanted. We cannot stop our desires, but desires have to be purified. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. So this is the process of //bhakti.// Therefore even one is infected with these lusty desires, //kāma-lobhadayas ca ye, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa... Rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa// means lusty desires and greediness, //kāma-lobha.// So, so long we are influenced by the two material modes of nature, //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// then we will be pushed for fulfilling our lusty desires and greediness. And that will help us to become implicated in sinful activities. The people are becoming implicated in sinful activities only for this //kāma-lobha.// He is never satisfied, and his greediness increases and we create sinful life.

So there is prescription in the //śāstras// that "If you are sinful, you do this //prāyaścitta,// atonement." //Tapo-dāna-vratādibhiḥ. Tapo, tapasya, dāna,// and observing some //vratās,// vows, ritualistic ceremonies, recommended. But here the Viṣṇudutas says that actually, by these processes, //tapasya, dāna... Na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat// [[books:bg:18:5|[Bg. 18.5]]]. Kṛṣṇa also says that... What is that verse? I just forget. That //tapasya, dāna, vrata...// Just like one has taken //sannyāsa. Sannyāsa// means he has given up all these obligatory ceremonies. But Kṛṣṇa says that "Even if you have taken //sannyāsa,// you cannot give up these processes." What is that? "//Tapasya, dāna// and //vrata.//" It is //pāvanāni manīṣiṇām.// Even if you have become //manīṣi,// very exalted great sage, still, you should continue this //tapasya.// And //tapasya// means voluntarily accepting some miserable condition. That is called //tapasya.// Just like they used to perform austerity in winter season, to go deep into the water. When one tries to avoid water, //tapasya// means one goes... You have seen many persons, they are standing within the water and chanting Gāyatrī //mantra.// This is //tapasya.// And in summer season they ignite fire all around and sit down.

So these things are not possible at the present moment in the Kali-yuga. But little //tapasya// required. Without //tapasya// you cannot be purified. That little //tapasya// we have prescribed, that "Rise early in the morning at half past three." But they are so downtrodden, they cannot do it. "Let me sleep five minutes more. I'll enjoy." You see? Such downtrodden. They were performing austerities, standing in the water in winter season, and we are recommending, "Please rise early in the morning at half past three. Be prepared for //maṅgala-ārati//"---it is very difficult job. Just see how much we are fallen. We cannot sacrifice, say, fifteen minutes or half an hour's sleep. We consider, "Sleeping is very good enjoyment." I have seen in the Western countries, they want to sleep so much. That is enjoyment. Up to twelve o'clock in daytime. There are many Indians also, they sleep up to twelve o'clock, and then they prepare for going to the office, big man. He goes to the office at four o'clock, when the office is going to be closed. That is their enjoyment. "I have slept so much. That is my life's success. I have eaten so much. That is my enjoyment. I have enjoyed sex life so much. That is my..." He does not know... The rascal does not know that he is becoming implicated for the next birth. If you are too much sleeping, then you become owl. You know? The whole day they can sleep, the owl. If you want to be naked, all right, you become a tree. Stand five thousand years naked. If you want sex, all right, become a hog or a monkey. Nature is prepared to give you facilities.

So purification means to stop this low-grade life. And low-grade life is there. Otherwise wherefrom they are coming? These cats and dogs and other lower animals, wherefrom they are coming? //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur deha upapatti// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. We are creating the facility for the next body, //karmanā.// Therefore it has to be purified. That is called //tapaḥ. Tapo divyaṁ-putrakā yena śuddhyet// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. This is the... "My dear boys..." Ṛṣabhādeva instructed His children, hundred sons, "My dear boys, just prepare yourself for //tapasya.//" That is the whole Vedic civilization, //tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ. Tapasya// for realizing God. This is the only business of the human life, not any other business. Any other business will not help you. Otherwise everyone would have been very rich man. Everyone is trying, whole day and night working. Does it mean that everyone is becoming Birla and like that? No. That is not possible. You can get only what is destined to you, not more than that. You cannot get more than that. Therefore //śāstra// says, //tasyaiva hetoḥ prayeteta kovido. Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayeteta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]]. We are, by the impelling of the material nature---//prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]---we are wandering throughout the whole universe in different types of bodies, in different planets, but we are not getting released. Therefore our only business is to get released from this repetition of birth and death. //Śāstra... Tapo... Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayeteta kovido.// You have become the inhabitants of the higher planets, and you have become an ant, a small insect. This is going on. But you haven't got that release. Now you have got sense; you are human being---//tapo divyam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. Now you engage yourself in that //tapasya. Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriya na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat. Yajña, dāna// and //tapasya.// Kṛṣṇa says, "These things are not to be given up." That is human civilization. //Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriya na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat:// "It must be done." So if we do not do that, then you are not human being. We are not... We are losing the chance of becoming purified, and again implicated in the cycle of birth and death.

So these things can be very easily done, as it is said here, //tad api īśa āṅghri-sevayā,// simply by dedicating yourself at the lotus feet of Īśa, the supreme controller. //Īśa// means controller. Jagadīśa. God's another name is Jagadīśa. He is the controller of the whole universe. So //īśāṅghri-sevayā.// That is the only way. So that //seva// begins from tongue. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau// [Brs. 1.2.234]. You can begin //īśa-seva// by the tongue, service. Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, that is also by tongue, and eating //prasādam.// Very easy. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given us this easy program. So don't deviate from this. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take //prasādam.// Make life simplified and be happy. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
