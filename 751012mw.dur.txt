**Indian man (1):**
...regarding this //Candi-patha.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Candi-patha// means you..., if you properly read, you get some material profit. That's all. No spiritual profit.

**Indian man (1):**
There is no special significance in it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You get material profit. [break] //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //alpavat tu phalaṁ teṣām:// "The result of material profit is for a short duration of time," //tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]], "and these things are desired by less-intelligent class of men." His real need is how to gain his spiritual life. That is his real need. But he does not want that. He wants some material profit for the time being. This is less intelligent. Suppose if somebody gives you some money and he says, "Tomorrow I shall take it away," will you... [laughs] So, //tad bhavaty alpa-medhasā.// [break] //...kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajanty anya-devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]: "They worship demigods, bewildered by lusty desires." And so long we have got lusty desires, we have to change our body, and that we do not know, what kind of body we are going to get next birth. Therefore, without knowing this, if we become mad after material profit, then less intelligent.

**Indian man (1):**
Yogendra, you wanted to ask Swāmījī a question?

**Indian man (2):**
Yes. If we become completely Kṛṣṇa conscious...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Indian man (2):**
If we follow the Kṛṣṇa conscious path... Now, take for example our wedding ceremonies. Now, the first thing that we take, the Gaṇapati, there is //Ganasyainava//[?], and various other deities that we have to respect. Now, what happens in his case?

**Prabhupāda:**
If you are actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, then to worship Gaṇapati, there is no harm. But if you take Gaṇapati as independent God, then your Kṛṣṇa consciousness is hampered.

**Indian man (2):**
But in certain ceremonies these things are...

**Prabhupāda:**
Any ceremony. If you know the constable is constable and the president is president, then it is all right. But if you think constable is president, then you are misguided.

**Indian lady:**
[Hindi exchange with Prabhupāda and other Indians] [break]

**Indian man (3):**
...this country, what do you think is the best way of establishing the //āśrama,// or the centers, and which way we can help in this matter?

**Prabhupāda:**
We have got so many //āśramas.// You can see how we are doing. We have got hundred and two temples all over the world. You come to India?

**Indian man (3):**
Yes, I have been to India.

**Prabhupāda:**
So this time you come and see our temple in Vṛndāvana. We have got, India, four, five temples. We have got in London, New York. In London we have got two temples, big, big. One is very big. In New York we have got. Los Angeles. Everywhere we have got. Here also, yesterday's paper, there was some advertisement, one Mr. Desai.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayanti Desai.

**Indian man (3):**
Jayanti Desai, yes. Yes, he wants to give some charities.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why not give us? Then we can make a nice...

**Indian man (3):**
I think we could approach him and see what... They are asking for applications from various charitable organizations.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I have come temporarily. Why don't you approach?

**Indian man (3):**
Yes, we will...

**Prabhupāda:**
If he is known to you, you can approach, that "Here is a good cause, International..."

**Indian man (3):**
Yes, that's right. I will send a message to him to come and see you this evening.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, that will be very nice. Then I can talk. Yes. When you will bring him?

**Indian man (3):**
I think you are meeting the officials of various organizations this evening?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They've been invited.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, right.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Different organizations in Durban. Six p.m.

**Indian man (3):**
Six p.m. Yes. I will send a message to him today.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Also Dr. Desai, his brother.

**Indian man (3):**
Yes. Dr. Desai has been very helpful in establishing societies and schools and charitable organizations. Yes, I will also send a message to Dr. Desai to come and see you. Dr. Desai sacrificed all his medical practice and all for the people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Indian man (3):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[heavy wind blowing] //Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā śreya-ācaraṇaṁ...// [break] ...by words, by intelligence, everyone should serve Kṛṣṇa, then life is successful. //Pranair arthair dhiya vacaḥ.//

**Indian man (1):**
Lot of meetings, religious meetings, especially here in South Africa...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Indian man (1):**
In South Africa, here especially, number of religious meetings and so on, they start off with the Gāyatrī //mantra// three times, and at the end of the meeting they have a //śantipat.// Now is there any real necessity for a religious meeting to start off with the Gāyatrī //mantra// and end with //śantipat?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's not bad.

**Indian man (1):**
But I don't see that being practiced in the...

**Prabhupāda:**
We chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That includes everything. It is called //mahā-mantra.// It includes all //mantras.// Gāyatrī //mantra// is not to be chanted in the public loudly. That is not the system.

**Indian man (1):**
Not to be chanted.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
In the public loudly. No.

**South African devotee (1):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, in this country we have to do army training, and on a Sunday we have to attend a church service. We have to attend it. Is it all right to say that we won't attend it because we follow Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or must we go anyway? It's sort of a Christian denomination service on a Sunday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is good. Those who are doing nothing, for them to attend the church at least for one hour, that is better than... Something is better than nothing, you see. That is good. People have completely forgotten God. They are doomed. So better to remember at least for some time. That is good.

**Indian man (3):**
We would like you to stay more longer in this country.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Indian man (3):**
We would like to request you to stay more longer in this country.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if you start a good center I will stay and see that things are going on. [aside:] Just take this stick.

**Indian man (3):**
Then I could... I think we would be able to benefit from you much more. See, your arrival in this period in Durban, with so many functions that we are carrying on today in this whole week, that people were sort of distributed, and quite a lot of them were unable to even come to your meetings.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. No, our meetings were well attended.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. We have had full house all the time.

**Indian man (3):**
Yes, I know your house, but you could have had even more than full house.

**Indian man (1):**
There are about four hundred thousand Indians alone here.

**Indian man (3):**
Yes. The reason of that Navarātri festival these Ārya-samājīs they have had, well in advance. They had their celebrations and all, so a lot of people were unable to come. Do you think it will be possible for you to come back to Durban from Johannesburg, after your Johannesburg stay?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I can come back. There is no harm. [break]

**Indian man (3):**
And when you have these //āśramas// and all, and how to serve the poor people in the way of welfare?

**Prabhupāda:**
Give them //prasādam.// Give them //prasādam.// We are giving two thousand, three thousand men each center //prasādam.//

**Indian man (3):**
And also to rehabilitate them against their...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We are giving them shelter also---food, cloth, everything---giving them proper chance to live peacefully and be God conscious.

**Indian man (3):**
And in the way of hospitals?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hospitals, there are many, but real hospitals, to cure the material disease, there is no hospital. They are... There are hundreds and thousands of hospitals for curing the disease of the body, but there is no hospital to cure the disease of the soul. That is the defect. So we are opening hospital for curing the disease of the soul. They have no information about the soul throughout the whole world. Even so-called religious organizations, they have no information about the soul. They go to religious ceremonies for material profit.

They do not know what is the necessity of the soul and what is the disease of the soul. They do not know. [break] //...nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam// [[books:bg:7:13|[Bg. 7.13]]]. What is the goal of life, these people, they do not know. //Mūḍhas. Mūḍha// means rascals, //gādha.// They do not know what is the goal of life. They take calculation of the duration of life, that fifty, sixty or hundred years, that's all. Beyond this, after this, they do not know. Yes. That is the defect. [break] Now, in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that this temporary attempt to become happy---//antavanta phalaṁ teṣām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]---it will end with the end of the body. But they do not know beyond this. Therefore //alpam-medhasām,// they are less intelligent. Just like a child playing. He likes to play and does not go to school. So do you think that is all right?

**Indian man (3):**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
So therefore we are doing like that. We are concerned that "I have got this body. Let me enjoy to the fullest extent, and don't mind what I am going to have in future. It doesn't matter."

**Indian man (3):**
You get attracted by a lot of side attractions.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And the education is so defective that even university students, if I say that "You are going to be a dog," they say, "What is the harm if I become?" They say like that. The education is so defective, they don't mind to become a dog. They think, "It is a facility to become a dog, because I can have sex on the street without any restrictions."

**Indian man (3):**
Yes. I mean they have lost their self-respect for that.

**Prabhupāda:**
No consideration. They are actually like cats and dogs. This is going on. [break] Nobody knows what is soul; nobody knows what is the goal of life; nobody knows what is the necessity of the soul. These things are not discussed, neither they know it. So-called religious institution or so-called..., they do not know. It is only mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// and that... They do not take care of this //Bhagavad-gītā.// They manufacture their own ways of...

**Indian man (3):**
Is there any other books before //Bhagavad-gītā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //Vedas// there are. Yes. But what is the purpose of //Veda?// The purpose of //Veda// is to understand God. If you do not understand God... Just like the Ārya-samājīs. They are concerned with //Vedas,// they say. But they do not know what is God. They say, "I am God." This is their knowledge. If he is God, who is going to worship him? Nobody comes to kick on his face, and still he says, "I am God." This is going on. How you become God? Who worships you? But still he will say, "I am God." You see. Such foolishness is going on. //Ārya. Ārya// means advanced, and this is their advancement. //Ārya// means advanced, and this is their advancement that they think, "I am God." Just see. Everyone can think like that. Then what is the use of advancement? This is going on. [break] //...sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. //Veda// means knowledge. So the ultimate knowledge is to know God. But if you do not know God, then what is the value of your knowledge?

**Indian man (3):**
Quite right.

**Prabhupāda:**
If you say like a rascal that "I am God," is that knowledge?

**Indian man (3):**
It's no knowledge at all.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Still they claim they are advanced Āryans.

**Indian lady:**
And Vallabhācārya?

**Prabhupāda:**
Vallabhācārya, he was a Vaiṣṇava. He worships Kṛṣṇa, Bāla-Kṛṣṇa. That's all right.

**Indian lady:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes.

**Indian man:**
[Indian man asks Prabhupāda if he speaks Gujarati in Gujarati or Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Na Gujarati, ne.// Hindi I can. [break] ...the four //sampradāyas:// Rāmānuja, Madhvācārya, then Viṣṇu Svāmī. Vallabhācārya belongs to the Viṣṇu Svāmī group, and we belong to Madhvācārya, so there is no difference.

**Indian man (3):**
She's a very staunch believer in Vallabhācārya and Devaputi Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Mostly Gujaratis are Vallabhācārya follower. I know that. That is good. So you are worshiping Bāla-Kṛṣṇa? You are worshiping Bāla-Kṛṣṇa?

**Indian man (3):**
Bāla-Kṛṣṇa, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. [Hindi] ...there one opinion of the Vallabhācārya //sampradāya...// [break] [end]
