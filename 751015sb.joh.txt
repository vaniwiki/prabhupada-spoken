**Prabhupāda:**
[//prema-dhvani//]

Thank you very much. [devotees offer obeisances]

> yayā sammohito jīva
> ātmānaṁ tri-guṇātmakam

> tat-kṛtaṁ cābhipadyate
> [[books:sb:1:7:5|[SB 1.7.5]]]

So our present position is like this, that //sammohita,// bewildered, puzzled by //māyā.// We are eternal part and parcel of God, but on account of being enchanted by this material energy, or external energy of God, we have forgotten ourself, and we are now entangled. We have forgotten our goal of life. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. The conditioned soul... Conditioned soul means the living being, the spirit soul who is conditioned by these laws of material nature. The laws of material nature is that you have to accept a certain type of body according to your propensity. We create propensity. And Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He gives you the facility: "All right." Just like the tiger, he wants to suck blood. Or any man, if he wants to suck blood, then he will be given the facility of a tiger's body. If a person has no discrimination in eating---whatever available, he can eat---then he will be given facility of become a pig. Up to stool, he can eat.

So this is stated very clearly in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati
> bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
> yantrārūḍhāni māyayā
> [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]

This is very significant. //Yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.// We are riding on a machine. This body is a machine, but we are accepting machine as myself. This is called //sammohita,// "bewildered." If you are running on a car, if you think, "I am the car," as it is foolishness, similarly, I have got this //yantra,// machine, body, and it is running on on account of my presence, or I am driving, or Kṛṣṇa is giving me intelligence how to drive. But if I identify myself with this body, exactly like a foolish man---he is driving the car, and if he identifies himself with the car, he is a foolish man---so this is called //sammohita. Yayā sammohito jīva.// Therefore the example, as I was citing yester..., last night, that we do not see the driver, and when the driver goes away, then we see that the car is not moving, and then I can understand, "Oh, the driver, my father or my son, has gone away." We sometimes cry, "My father has gone away" or "My son has gone away," but because we are //sammohita,// we actually never saw the father and the son. We accepted this coat-pant body as father and son. This is called //sammoha,// bewildered.

//Yayā sammohito jīva ātmānam:// the spirit soul, //ātmānaṁ tri-guṇātmakam...// This body is //tri-guṇātmakam.// The body is made according to the modes of material nature: //kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. Everything is very clearly explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// This is further development. //Bhagavad-gītā...// If you understand //Bhagavad-gītā,// and if you actually surrender to Kṛṣṇa... The last word of Kṛṣṇa is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. If you actually understand //Bhagavad-gītā,// this will be the result. And in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, //tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ hareḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:17|[SB 1.5.17]]]. //Sva-dharma.// Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya.// So that means every one of us... //Dharma// means occupational duty. That is //dharma,// characteristic. So Kṛṣṇa orders, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. If we accept it, even by sentiment... That is confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ hareḥ patet tato yadi, bhajann apakvo 'tha.// Nārada Muni says that "If somebody, even by sentiment---'All right, Kṛṣṇa says //sarva-dharmān parityajya.// Let us stop any other business, become Kṛṣṇa conscious'---even one accepts by sentiment, not thoroughly understanding, he is also fortunate." He also fortunate because he accepts the real thing. Therefore Nārada Muni said that "Even one accepting by sentiment, and later on," //bhajann apakvo 'tha,// "his execution of devotional service not mature and he falls down, then," Nārada Muni says, //yatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kim,// "where is the loss for that person? And the other hand, the other person who has not accepted this---he is very regularly executing his respons..., material responsibility---what does he gain by that?" This is the opinion. "If Kṛṣṇa consciousness is accepted even by sentiment, and after that, even he falls down, there is no loss. And if we are very faithful to our material duties, then," Nārada Muni says, "what do we gain by that?"

So this is very important thing. We do not gain anything. We gain only another body---again begin chapter, the same struggle for existence. And that also, there is no guarantee. According to our //karma,// we shall have to accept a body. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. As we associate... Just like we develop a certain type of disease as we contaminate the germ. If you contaminate the virus of smallpox, then you have to suffer from smallpox. Nature's law is so strict; you cannot avoid it. If you have been attacked by the mosquito carrying malaria germ, then you have to suffer from malaria. So //kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya.// As we take precaution that "I may not be attacked with malaria or smallpox or this or that"---so many, we take precaution---similarly, we have to be very precautious for our next body. If we become precautious, then there is chance of being promoted, //ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ// [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]. If you keep yourself in the //sattva-guṇa,// the brahminical qualification, //śamo damas titikṣā ārjavam, satyaṁ śaucaṁ jñānaṁ vijñānam, āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam...// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. Similarly, there are //kṣatriya// qualities, there are //vaiśya// qualities, there are //śūdra// qualities, and there are //śūdrādhama// quality, less-than-the-//śūdra// quality. So in any quality, in any position, even by sentiment, //tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ hareḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:17|[SB 1.5.17]]], if we take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is the greatest profit from any position. It doesn't matter in which position he is, either he is on the //brāhmaṇa// position or //kṣatriya// position or //vaiśya// position or //śūdra// position or //caṇḍāla// position.

That is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā: māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. //Pāpa-yoni,// lower class, very, very lower class. //Pāpa-yoni,// their description in the //śāstra, kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. So these //pāpa-yoni,// these black, they are also considered //pāpa-yoni,// but for everyone Kṛṣṇa consciousness is open. //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda. Hūṇa, kirāta, andhra, pulinda, pulkaśa, ābhīra, śumbha, yavana, khasādaya...// Mongolia, those who do not develop mustaches, //khasādaya, ye 'nye ca pāpa,// and lower than that, //yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ//---if he takes sincerely the shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa or His devotee, //yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ śudhyanti,// he becomes very purified. There is no, I mean to say, bar for anyone. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// the same thing is confirmed:

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]

So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice. If we take to it as our goal of life, then our life is successful. Otherwise---//yayā sammohito jīva ātmānaṁ tri-guṇātmakam// [[books:sb:1:7:5|[SB 1.7.5]]]---we shall continue the life of changing this body. That we have to do. We cannot be independent. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. If we think that we are independent, that is due to our ignorance. We are not independent. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.// He is simply //sammohita,// by false prestige. He is not independent at all. We should always remember this. We are dependent on the laws of nature. We cannot say, "Now I invented some scientific discovery. We shall not going to die." That is not possible. You must die. That is the law of nature. You must die, you must take birth also, and you must be diseased and you must suffer from old age. These are the four disadvantages of material existence.

So if we want to get out... This is //anartha.// That will be explained in the next verse. Read it.

> anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād
> bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje
> lokasyājānato vidvāṁś
> cakre sātvata-saṁhitām
> [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]

This //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is //sātvata-saṁhitām,// spiritual knowledge. It has nothing to do with anything material. Simply spiritual knowledge. So //vidvān. Vidvān// means the most learned, Vyāsadeva, not ordinary. //Śrīmad-bhāgavate mahā-muni-kṛte// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. He is //mahā-muni. Muni// means thoughtful philosopher, and he is //mahā-muni.// He is greater than any thoughtful philosopher, Vyāsadeva, Veda-vyāsa. His name is Veda-vyāsa. //Veda-vyāsa// means he compiled all this Vedic literature. And at last he summarized the whole Vedic knowledge into //Vedānta-sūtra, Vedānta-sūtra,// a small aphorism: //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]], //athāto brahma jijñāsā, ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt...// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. In short aphorism. And it has got very deep meaning. That is //Vedānta-sūtra.// And this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is commentary on the //Vedānta-sūtra// by the author himself under the instruction of his //guru,// Nārada Muni. Therefore we began this that according to the advice of Nārada Muni, that "You write about the Supreme Personality of Godhead." So he began... We began this:

> bhakti-yogena manasi
> samyak praṇihite 'male
> apaśyat puruṣaṁ pūrṇaṁ
> māyāṁ ca tad-apāśrayam
> [[books:sb:1:7:4|[SB 1.7.4]]]

By //bhakti-yoga...// The //bhakti-yoga// is also mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā// is //bhakti-yoga,// but about //jñāna-yoga, karma-yoga, haṭha-yoga// and other //yogas// there are description, but at last Kṛṣṇa advises that "The most confidential part of knowledge I am speaking to you, Arjuna, is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]." This is real gain.

So this is //bhakti-yoga.// To surrender unto the Supreme Lord, that is //bhakti-yoga.// So here Vyāsadeva began his realization, //bhakti-yogena manasi samyak praṇihite amale// [[books:sb:1:7:4|[SB 1.7.4]]]. By //bhakti-yoga// you can cleanse your mind without any contamination, immediately. If you want to be liberated from the contamination of material existence, or material modes of nature, then immediately you take to //bhakti-yoga.// That is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

You want to realize yourself as Brahman. We are Brahman---there is no doubt about it---but we have no realization because //sammohita, yayā sammohitaḥ:// the //māyā// has captured us. So immediately if you want to be liberated... //Mukti// means, //mukti... Muktir hitvānyathā rūpam. Muktir hitvānyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. This is //mukti, svarūpa.// Our //svarūpa// is our spiritual life. When we give up other activities, //anyathā,// which is not spiritual... Material activities, that is not our actual business. Actual business is spiritual activity. Material activity means this body, to keep this body in comfortable position. And the body is changing. Now, today, I am Indian---I am very great Indian leader or very good philanthropist. Now, tomorrow, or the next life, I may not be Indian; I may be Chinese or I may be European. Then my whole business program changed. Again another nationality, another feeling. So in this way... And if I become cats and dogs, then another mentality. This is going on.

So I am forgetting that my identification is spiritual---//ahaṁ brahmāsmi//---and I am accepting all these unnecessary things, //anartha.// So //anartha...// If you want to stop this //anartha,// if you want to keep yourself in your original position of spiritual identity, then you have to take to //bhakti-yoga.// This is the conclusion of the //śāstra. Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣāt.// Directly, not indirectly. //Anartha.// These //anartha...// I am not this body, but I have to change this body after hundred years or ten years or fifty years, according to the size. The dogs and cats, they change ten years. The cows, twenty years. And human being, utmost hundred years. And the demigods, many millions of years. But death is there. You have to change that body. When Hiraṇyakaśipu executed very severe austerity, so Lord Brahmā came to him: "So what do you want? You are executing so severe austerities. What is your desire?" "I want to become immortal." So Brahmā said, "That is not possible. Nobody is immortal within this material world. I am not immortal. How can I give you the benediction of immortality? That is not possible."

So nobody... Everyone is under the laws of nature. It may be... The duration of time may be little more or less, but everyone must die. This is... And if we want to stop this business of material existence, then here is the recommendation, //anarthopaśamam... Anartha.// "Why we shall die?" This question does not arise. If I am immortal, as it is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre... Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācin nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ..., na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. So this question does not strike us, that "If I am immortal---I have no birth, I have no death...," //na jāyate mriyate vā kadācit// "...at any time. Not that sometimes I was dying. No, never." //Nityaḥ śāśvato yaṁ na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.// This is the position. "Then why I am accepting this birth and death and old age, disease? This is my problem." So we do not think that, neither we are educated how to stop it. But there is process. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// If you simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa... //Janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ.// Not Kṛṣṇa ordinarily---factually, //kṛṣṇa-tattvataḥ. Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ,// actually, in fact, in truth. Then what is the result? //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti:// "His, the cycle of birth and death, old age, and dis..., stopped." //Tyaktvā deham.// We have to give up this body, that is certain. But after giving up this body, no more material body. Then what happens? He is finished? No, he is not finished. //Mām eti:// "He comes to Me, back to home." And when you go there, then you must possess the same body as Kṛṣṇa has got. Kṛṣṇa has //sac-cid-ānanda-vig...// Just like if you want to enter into the sun planet. The sun planet is made of fiery elements. Everyone there, their body is made of fire. So if you want to enter into the sun planet, then you must also make your body made of fire. Just like this body is made of earth, so similarly, there are different types of bodies made of air, made of water, made of fire, these five elements, material. //Kṣitir āpas tejo marud vyoma.// So in different planets... So if you go back to home, back to Godhead, then you have to gain your original, spiritual body.

There is spiritual body. That we do not know. There is no education. We have got spiritual body. That spiritual body is covered by this material layer, just like your body is covered by shirt and coat, //vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya// [[books:bg:2:22|[Bg. 2.22]]]. Everything explained. We are simply giving up. One dress is now old and rotten; we throw it away and accept another dress. Similarly, this body, when it is not workable---it is old enough; the physiological function is not going on nicely---then there is change of body. Arjuna was advised that "Why you are lamenting for your old grandfather? Better kill him. He will get a new body. He will get a new body." Of course, it was spoken jokingly because grandfather... So, but the fact is that. Fact is that, that the, after the old body... Just like we have got several types of body: babyhood to childhood, child to boyhood, youthhood, old body. Then after this, he is... //Vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya// [[books:bg:2:22|[Bg. 2.22]]]. When we give up this body as dress, old and rotten, we get another. This is going on.

But this is //anartha. Anartha// means unnecessarily we are undergoing this change of body. //Anartha.// If you want to stop it, //anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣāt,// directly, immediately, what is that? //Bhakti-yogam. Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]. And Kṛṣṇa also confirms. This is statement of Vyāsadeva, and Kṛṣṇa also says,

> māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena ya sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

So, //bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.// This is real purpose of life. This is real purpose of religion. //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.// The same thing. That is first-class religion. It doesn't matter what kind of religion you are following, but if the religious system teaches you how to become a devotee to Adhokṣaja---//adhokṣaja// means beyond our sense perception, the Supreme Lord---then your life is perfect. Then you will be happy.

> sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo
> yato bhaktir adhokṣaje
> ahaituky apratihatā
> yayātmā samprasīdati
> [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]

If you want satisfaction, if you want real life, then you accept this, //yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.// Here the same thing, //anarthopaśa...// This business, struggle for existence, "Survival of the fittest," they say. But nobody is fit to survive. Everyone has to die. Nobody, even big, big scientists or big, big philosophers and..., they cannot survive. They talk of millions of years, but personally they live only fifty or sixty years, that's all. This is their position. They simply cheat people: "Maybe," "Perhaps," "Millions of years." And you are going to live for fifty years. Why you are talking of millions of years? So this is //anartha.//

So //anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣāt.// If we want to stop this unwanted business... If you don't want, go on with your business: //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. Now take this life, this body of human being or Indian and then American, then cat, then dog, then hog, then tree---so many, eight million---you go on if you like. But if you are actually intelligent, if you are disgusted, that "This is not very good business. This is //anartha,// unwanted business. I have been forced, //yayā sammohitaḥ...// Being bewildered, being illusioned, misdirected by this material energy, I am trying to be happy here in this material..., and it is not my business." If one comes to this sense... That is stated in the //Bhagavad..., bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]: "After many, many births. After many, many births, //jñānavān,// one who is actually in knowledge, wise..." Then what does he do? //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate:// He surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. The same thing, as Kṛṣṇa says, "Surrender to Me." If we do not do it... We have to do that, but if you want to wait //bahūnāṁ janma,// after many, many births, you have to do the same business, why not do it now? This is intelligence. If after //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]], when I actually become wise, why not become wise immediately? Kṛṣṇa says; Kṛṣṇa is canvassing. Why not take it up? And if you take it up, you are successful. //Tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ hareḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:17|[SB 1.5.17]]]. Even by sentiment you take it, you will be successful, it is so nice.

So Vyāsadeva recommends that //anartha,// this unwanted business of repetition of birth, death, old age, disease... And there is no certainty what kind of body I shall get. So this is our position. If you want to stop it, //anarthopaśamam.// If you stop this business, //bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje...// So how to execute //bhakti-yogam?// So //lokasyājānata:// "The people in general, they do not know it." There must be... For everything there must be education. //Lokasyājānato vidvān.// He compiled this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām// [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]. For your eternal life, here is the //saṁhitā,// Vedic literature. You take it and study it and follow it and be happy.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
