**Prabhupāda:**
//Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā mano-rathenāsato dhāvato bahiḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. Nondevotees, they are simply pulled on by the mental speculation: "This will be very nice. This will be very nice." //Mano rathena,// on the chariot of mind... //Asataḥ,// material. //Asat// means material, "that will not exist." They will be busy in such things. Real, eternal necessity, they'll not be interested. They do not know. "Now this beautiful city, it is my city, my country. Everything all right." But he has no knowledge that "After fifty years, when I shall die, where will be my city next?" That he does not know. For the time being, I shall be able to live here for twenty-five years or fifty years. That's all right. And next time, where I am going... A commonsense affair.

**Cyavana:**
That's a third-class mentality, to be satisfied with that city...

**Prabhupāda:**
Temporary...

**Cyavana:**
Simply to have a city and be satisfied.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Cyavana:**
Third-class mentality.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He's eternal. He does not know his eternal necessity. This is called ignorance. [break] You brought that sitting mat?

**Brahmānanda:**
No. Use our //chaddars.// [end]
