**Harikeśa:**
//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Canto Three, Chapter Twenty-eight, text number twenty. [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> tasmiû labdha-padaṁ cittaṁ
> sarvāvayava-saṁsthitam
> vilakṣyaikatra saṁyujyād
> aṇge bhagavato muniḥ
> [[books:sb:3:28:20|[SB 3.28.20]]]

[01:17]

Translation: "In fixing his mind on the eternal form of the Lord, the yogī should not take a collective view of all His limbs, but should fix the mind on each individual limb of the Lord."

**Prabhupāda:**

> tasmiû labdha-padaṁ cittaṁ
> sarvāvayava-saṁsthitam
> vilakṣyaikatra saṁyujyād
> aṇge bhagavato muniḥ
> [[books:sb:3:28:20|[SB 3.28.20]]]

So as we have explained many times, that this //arcā-mūrti...// The rascal class of men, they cannot understand //arcā-mūrti.// They think that "They are worshiping idol." Even amongst the Hindus there are so-called followers of //Vedas,// they also say that "What is the necessity of worshiping Deity in the temple?" They made very vigorous propaganda in India to stop temple worship. For a short time it has got some reaction, but now it is finished. That rascal propaganda not to worship the Deity in the temple is finished. Nobody cares for that. They think that God is everywhere---except in the temple. [laughter] That is their view. And God is everywhere; why not in the temple? No. That is their poor fund of knowledge. They cannot accommodate. No. God is everywhere, but not in the temple. This is their intelligence, rascals. So we have to follow therefore //ācārya. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.14.2]: one who has accepted //ācārya...// One who knows the //śāstra// and practically behaves according to the regulation of //śāstra,// he is called //ācārya. Acinoti śāstrārthaḥ.//

So all the //ācāryas...// In India there are many thousands and thousands of temples, very, very big temples, especially in South India. Some of them you have seen. Each temple is like a big fort. So all these temples were established by the //ācāryas,// not that the people whimsically established. No. Still there is very prominent temple, Bālajī temple, Tirupati, Tirumalai. People are going, and the daily collection is more than one //lakh// of rupees still. Although they have been propagated so vigorously not to visit temples, but people... That is the birthright in India---they are automatically Kṛṣṇa conscious. Automatically. Therefore all the demigods, they also desire to take birth in India. Automatically.

So the temple worship is essential. So those who are against temple worship, Deity worship, they are not very intelligent class of men---foolish, //mūḍha.// Again, the same word.

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuri bhāvam āśritāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

//Māyayāpahṛta jñānāḥ.// They are talking very big, big words, that "God is everywhere," but they are forbidding temple worship. //Apahṛta-jñānā.// The knowledge is imperfect. A common man can say, "If God is everywhere, why not in the temple?" And if we have to worship God, why not in His original form? The original form, Kṛṣṇa, when He was present, the original form so many people have seen. They have got photograph..., not photograph; paintings. And it is confirmed in the //śāstras,// in the //Brahma-saṁhitā, veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam// [Bs. 5.30]. Kṛṣṇa is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,// from so millions and millions of years ago described by Lord Brahma, that //veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ.// He is always playing His flute, //veṇuṁ. Venu// means flute. //Kvaṇantam.// And eyes are like the petals of lotus flower. //Veṇum kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ barhāvataṁsam// [Bs. 5.30]. And on the head He has got the plume of peacock feather. In this way the description is there in the //śāstra.// And when Kṛṣṇa came... [aside:] Let him... Why do you disturb? Let him do that. Sit down. So //śāstra// says Kṛṣṇa is like this. And when Kṛṣṇa appeared on this planet the exactly the same description was there in His form.

So we have to accept the form of the Lord as confirmed in the //śāstra// and as confirmed by the //ācārya.// Then it is perfect. //Sādhu śāstra guru vākya tinete kariyā aikya.// We have to understand something very rigidly by three things, the... It must be confirmed by the //śāstra,// and it must be confirmed by the //ācāryas// and by the spiritual master. Very simple thing. We have description of Kṛṣṇa in the //śāstra, Brahma-saṁhitā,// the treatise given by Lord Brahma. And this //Brahma-saṁhitā// was collected from South India in handwriting by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and He delivered to His devotees. So the //sādhu...// Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa. Still, He is playing the part of a //sādhu. Sādhu// and //śāstra, Brahma-saṁhitā.// And because we have received from Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we are delivering to our disciples: "Here is Kṛṣṇa's form." The //sādhu, śāstra, guru,// it must be confirmed. Then we can accept. Not that whimsically if some rascal comes and becomes God by concoction. We cannot accept. It must be confirmed by... [aside:] Why do you bother? Let them. No, no. As he likes. That's all.

So //sādhu, śāstra, guru.// This is the way. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu was instructing Sanātana Gosvāmī in various subject matter, and he also described the incarnation in Kali-yuga from //śāstra// that,

> kṛṣṇa-varṇam tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ
> sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
> yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ-prāyair
> yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ
> [SB 11.5.32]

He quoted from //Bhāgavatam,// "This is the incarnation of Kali-yuga." So He is Himself //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ-prāyaiḥ.// So Sanātana Gosvāmī was prime minister, very intelligent man. So he had inquired from Caitanya Mahāprabhu that "How we can accept the //avatāra?//" So Caitanya Mahāprabhu also said, "From the //śāstra.//" And Sanātana Gosvāmī got it confirmed that Caitanya Mahāprabhu was... He stopped, of course. When he inquired that "Shall I accept this personality who is now preaching //saṅkīrtana// movement and along with His associates, He is the Supreme Lord?" Then Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Let us go on further. We don't..."

So this is the way, not whimsically accept any rascal as //avatāra.// No. That is not the process. Or any rascal as God. This rascaldom has killed the whole human society to become atheist. You should be very, very careful of these rascals. As soon as somebody says that "I am God," you shall immediately take him as dog, not God. So God is not so cheap. In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// the description of God, Kṛṣṇa, is given, and it is said there,

> yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya
> jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ
> viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣo
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.48]

Govinda, the //ādi-puruṣa,// His plenary representation is Mahā-Viṣṇu. And what is the description of Mahā-Viṣṇu? //Yasya eka niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya:// from one exhaling of the breath, then, //yasyaika niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya,// all these innumerable universes. We are seeing... We are in one universe. There are many millions of universes. That we cannot see. We are within this universe compact. We can see it is packed up, just like a ball. But there are many such. So all these different universes controlled by one Lord Brahma, they are coming during the exhaling period of Mahā-Viṣṇu's breathing. That is God. Who can imagine it? //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ.// And universes are coming from the..., what is called? Hole?

**Devotee:**
Pores.

**Prabhupāda:**
Pores. Pores of the body. From breathing in this way. Then just imagine how many pores are there in the Mahā-Viṣṇu's body and how many universes are coming. And this is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> athavā bahunaitena
> kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna
> viṣṭabhyā idaṁ kṛtsnam
> ekāṁśena sthito jagat
> [[books:bg:10:42|[Bg. 10.42]]]

"This material manifestation is one fourth-part of My energy, so many innumerable universes." And this is the plenary portion of God, Govinda---not full, but plenary, one part only. And do you think God is so cheap, anyone can become God? You don't take so cheaply that "Here is a God, incarnation. Here is a God." All bogus. Immediately reject them. //Sādhu śāstra guru vākya.//

So this //arca-vigraha// which you are worshiping, it is recommended by //sādhu,// by //ācārya,// by //śāstra.// It is not poetic imagination. Don't think that Kṛṣṇa's form has been carved by the sculptor by some poetic imagination. No. //Sādhu śāstra guru vākya.// It is confirmed by the //sādhu,// by //śāstra,// by //ācārya.// So why? To give us facility. Give us facility. We cannot see God by this blunt, materialistic eyes. Materialistic eyes means everything we think in the..., with reference to our sense gratification. That is materialistic eyes. "Everything belongs to God"---that we cannot believe or neither we have got the power to understand it. Kṛṣṇa says, God says, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]: "Everything belongs to Me." Still, we are fighting: "No, this Africa is mine," "This America is mine," or "This India is mine." They are simply fighting, simply fighting on this misconception. It is clearly said, and is a fact. How this land becomes yours? It does not belong to you. You have come for the time being, for, say, fifty years, hundred years. But the land is lying for millions and millions of years. So before your coming, the land was there, and after your going away the land will be there. How it becomes yours? But they have no common sense, these rascals. They have no common sense. They are fighting---"nationalism." Therefore they are described as //go-khara, go-khara,// animals, cows and asses. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kunape tri-dhātuke svā-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma-ijya-dhīḥ// [SB 10.84.13]. //Bhauma-idya-dhīḥ,// this is nationalism, worshiping the land of birth. This is called nationalism.

So everyone is becoming very great personality by //bhauma-ijya-dhīḥ.// The land in which he has taken birth is worshipable, not this Deity. Deity is impersonal, but the land is personal. This is their intelligence. Therefore in //śāstra// it is said, //yasyātma-buddhiḥ kunape tri-dhātuke.// The mistake begins from this misunderstanding that "I am this body." Therefore all other mistakes... What are those? //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kunape tri-dhātuke..., svā-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu:// family. "My wife. This is my wife. This is my children. This is my father. This is my mother. We are in a family." //Svā-dhīḥ:// "They are my kith and kin. Others, they are all my enemies." So this crippled thought. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kunape tri-dhātuke svā-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu.// Because they have no knowledge that "Nobody is my father. Nobody is my mother. I am nobody's son. We are simply assembled together under certain condition, just like some straws gathered together by the waves of the river, and again, by the same river, it is tossed here and there, and then the straw remains one."

So we can study our history of life, that someone was born in India; someone was born in America; someone was born in Africa, Canada. So we have come together. We did... There was no idea that we shall have to give up our family relationship and come into this society of Kṛṣṇa conscious. So similarly, we mix together, intermingle, by chance. Not by chance---by the arrangement of the Supreme, by providence. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. So we play the part of the son, the father, the wife, the children, but it is exactly the same---a straw gathering by the waves of the river. So just like sometimes in a foreign country we make some relationship, brother, father, but that is not actually the fact. The real father is Kṛṣṇa. //Sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūrtayoyaḥ// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]].

So this is understanding. So we have to return to that understanding. Therefore it is advised how to make our relationship stronger with Kṛṣṇa. That is recommended here. //Tasmiû labdha-padaṁ cittaṁ sarvāvayava-saṁsthitam.// Don't think that Kṛṣṇa, or God, has no head, no tail. No. //Sarvāvayava saṁsthitam. Virāṭa-mūrti.// They are repeatedly said in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// But His //avayava,// different parts of the body, they are different from our, this material, at the present moment the material conception. That is different. He... Just like we can pick up our foodstuff by this hand. This hand is not just like Kṛṣṇa's hand. Kṛṣṇa's hand appears to be nonmoving. I think my hand is moving, but Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that even He has got the so-called statue hand, a metal hand or a stone hand, He can capture food which you offer. That you have to understand. When Kṛṣṇa is described as "He has no hand," that means He has no that limited hand as we have got. He has got... He appears before us just like a stone idol or statue, but He has got all the capacity of the limbs of the body, //sarvāvayava.// He has kindly appeared before us so that we can see. Here it is recommended that //saṁyujyād aṅge.// You have to see each and every part of the body, limb of Kṛṣṇa. That is meditation.

This //arca-vigraha...// By offering worship to the Deity, you see the lotus feet is there, the ankle is there, the mark in the sole is there. Everything is there. So each and every part you study and understand, "Kṛṣṇa is here. Kṛṣṇa is there." This is meditation. It is not that the rascal's theory that God is everywhere except in the temple. No. It is not like that. He is everywhere. Now He has appeared in this temple specifically to show His mercy how we can study very analytically: "Here is feet. Here is hand. The feet is marked with these symptoms. His hand is like this. His flute is like this. His hair is like this. Eyes are..." Study everything minutely. Then that is meditation, and this will help you to think of Kṛṣṇa constantly, and that will be trance, //samādhi, samādhi,// practical. It is not to be imaginary. The Māyāvādīs, they think that it is imagination. No, it is not imagination. It is confirmed by the //śāstras, sādhu śāstra guru vākya.//

So don't be misled by the Māyāvādīs. As we have got our //ācāryas,// they are instructing, as //Bhāgavata// is instructing, //Bhagavad-gītā// is instructing, we have to follow. And if we cannot follow, then we should see the //ācāryas,// how they are doing. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. In this way we have to make our life perfect.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...on this subject matter, not bring the whole list of questions.

**Girl devotee (1):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that the demigods, they want to take birth in India, but is there not the same Vedic culture in the heavenly planets? Why do they want to [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
They are missing the opportunity. That is their misfortune. They do not take advantage of the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā, Bhāgavatam.// They are taking to technology. What can be done?

**Brahmānanda:**
Her question was of the demigods, that you said that they wanted to take their birth in India, but is not the Vedic culture in the heavenly planets?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, heavenly, they... By pious activities they go to the heavenly planets, but they find there inconvenience in God consciousness. Therefore they desire that "By our pious activities we have come to this higher planetary system, and as soon as our reaction, or the resultant action of pious activities will be finished, we shall have to go again to the material, or this Bhūrloka. So if remaining little balance of our pious activities, instead of going anywhere, let us take birth in India." They desire like that. Just like Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, //janmāobi more iccha yadi tora kīṭa-janma ha-u..., dāsa tuara,// like that. He is praying, "My Lord, I do not know whether I am sufficiently fit to go back to home, to Godhead, but my only prayer is that if You think that I have to take birth again, so kindly give me this opportunity that I may take birth in a place..." //Kīṭa janma hau yathā dāsa tuyā:// "Let me become an insignificant ant in the house of a devotee. If I am going to take birth at all, so give me this concession, that let me take birth as an ant even in the house of a devotee." So Bhārata-varṣa, the //devatās,// the demigods, they desire to take birth in India because here is the opportunity. Still, so much broken, you will find, you have seen, that when we hold this Hare Kṛṣṇa festival, twenty thousand, fifty thousand men come automatically. You will find never in any other country. Still in India you will find that. Why? Because they have taken birth in India the facility is there. So it is very unfortunate that Indians are trying to forget Kṛṣṇa. Very unfortunate. //Kṛpaṇa.// If you have got money, if you don't utilize it properly, that is your misfortune. Similarly, in India, those who have taken birth, they have got the opportunity. //Bhagavad-gītā// was spoken in India, but they are reluctant. They're reluctant. This is their misfortune.

**Jñāna:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it sometimes more appropriate to worship //arca-mūrti// of Śrī Śrī Gaura-Nitāi than Śrī Śrī Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
That will be recommended to you by your spiritual master according to your position. There is no stereotyped idea. That you have to take instruction from your spiritual master, or you have to do according to the instruction of spiritual master. That will be done[?].

**Girl devotee (2):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we chant //japa// in front of //arca-mūrti,// do we then therefore, by this verse, meditate on Kṛṣṇa limb by limb?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Brahmānanda:**
When we chant //japa// in front of the Deity, does that correspond to this verse of meditating on the Lord limb by limb?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You can see. The Lord is everywhere. You can... Anyone can think. All right. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
