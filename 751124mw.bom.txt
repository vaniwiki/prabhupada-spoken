**Prabhupāda:**
...and therefore they are suffering.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The whole world is suffering on this misconception. The horse also. As soon as it gets on somebody on his back, he become jubilant immediately. This is the nature. //Jīvera 'svarūpa' haya-nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya. Jaya.// [break]

> kadāham aikāntika-nitya-kiṅkaraḥ
> praharsayīśyāmi sanātha-jīvitam
> [[books:cc:madhya:1:206|[Cc. Madhya 1.206]]]

This is Vaiṣṇava aspiration. //Bhavantam eva caran nirāntaram:// "Twenty-four hours simply carrying Your orders." And you can do it. But it is not possible; the mind is checking. //Prasanta-niḥśeṣa mano-rathāntaram.// Unless one's mind is fixed up, he cannot become servant of God. //Kadāham aikāntika-nitya-kiṅkara.// "In this way, when I shall be absolutely Your servant and live very joyfully, that 'I have got my master'?" This is Yamunacārya's verse.

> bhavantam eva caran nirāntaraṁ
> prasanta-niḥśeṣa-mano-rathāntaram

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sanātha-jīva.//

**Prabhupāda:**
They are all //anātha-jīvita.// Yes. Everyone is independence and //anātha.// There is //nātha,// but he'll not recognize. //Anātha-jīvita. Bhavantam eva caran nirāntaraṁ prasanta...// So we are educating people how to become //sanātha-jīvitam.// Live on your master's... Everyone is living at the cost of master, but foolishly... //Ahāṅkara-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. They are living at the cost of the master, but they will not accept. This is the disease. [break] ...natural life, //sanātha-jīvitam.// From the birth the child is //sanātha,// parents. Where is the possibility of living independently? That is not possible.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yamunācārya was //śiṣya// or //guru// of Rāmānujācārya?

**Prabhupāda:**
Rāmānujācārya.

**Dr. Patel:**
Rāmānujācārya was //guru// or //śiṣya?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //guru.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Guru.// I think Viṣṇu Svāmī was his //śiṣya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Viṣṇu Svāmī sampradāya, different. That is Rudra-sampradāya. And Rāmānujācārya is Śrī-sampradāya. The Vallabhācāryas, they belong to Viṣṇu Svāmī. We belong to Madhva-sampradāya. Four //ācāryas.//

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Who was the originator of Śrī-sampradāya?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Who was before...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Lakṣmījī. //Pāda-sevanam. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. Lakṣmījī is always engaged in massaging the feet of Lord Viṣṇu.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Rāmānujācārya is the biggest in line?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

**Indian man:**
[Hindi] [dogs barking] [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
...dog and the other. That is the bulldog. Russian is defeated. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is defeated?

**Dr. Patel:**
Other is English dog.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is Russian dog?

**Dr. Patel:**
This one is Russian.

**Brahmānanda:**
That's German.

**Dr. Patel:**
They have crossed the dog with the, what you call, the bull.

**Brahmānanda:**
German shepherd.

**Dr. Patel:**
So Germany is defeated, no? That's the same...

**Prabhupāda:**
The bulldogs are English?

**Dr. Patel:**
They are English. And Mr. Churchill is the representative of all the bulldogs. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...thinking, "I am English dog," [laughter] and he is thinking, "I am..." And the man is also thinking like that. What is the difference?

**Dr. Patel:**
Both are animals.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yasyātmā buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13].

**Dr. Patel:**
That is right. We have got a //dvija, dvija-karma kriya. Dvijā-karma-kriya?// What do you call it?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Saṁskāra.//

**Dr. Patel:**
All are born as animal.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Saṁskāra,// yes. //Dvija-saṁskāra.// Second birth.

**Prabhupāda:**
That //saṁskāra// is now stopped; therefore all of them are animals. Yes. [break] The //murgis// [chickens], they are in the cowshed?

**Dr. Patel:**
That man who is looking after cows, he must be keeping.

**Prabhupāda:**
For //andha// [eggs]?

**Dr. Patel:**
For everything. They eat even the //murgis.// Nowadays this meat-eating has become very widespread in India. Even //brāhmaṇas// are eating meat. I don't mean those who have gone to Europe or America and come back, but people who are staying here. Extremely common.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the sign that in very near future there will be no food grains. That is the sign. There will be no rice, no wheat, main food grain.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Already in Bombay it's about six, seven rupees per kilo, rice.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Dr. Patel:**
No, no. Now rice will be very much down. In Gujarat it is two rupees. I bought some land here and sown the rice. We are going to get about eight hundred or a thousand //maunds// of rice. And when we sown the field it was sixty rupees, rice. Today it is thirty-two rupees. It is coming down. The crop is very good everywhere, all over India, this year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because there was sufficient rain.

**Dr. Patel:**
Very good rain, yes. Gujarat will be more than self-sufficient. It is already the richest part of this country.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Parjanyāt.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ. Annād bhavati bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. It is...

**Prabhupāda:**
This is cycle. Perform //yajña,// and everything will come. They have stopped //yajña.// Therefore //hari-nāma-yajña,// this is the //yajña.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Viṣṇu... //Viṣṇur vai yajñaḥ.// Viṣṇu Himself is //yajña.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break]

**Devotee (1):**
...were saying that it is because of our chanting twenty-four hours a day that there is more rain this year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In Hyderabad they also say. For six or seven years there was no rain. Now it is raining. This is practical. [break] //...yanti bhūtāni.//

**Devotee in distance:**
//Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Who is that? Old man?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [Hindi] [break] ...has died. His grandson is maintaining. [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
//...yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] //...yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ.// Not for sense gratification. Then you will suffer. But they are all working for sense gratification, not //yajñārthe. Yajnārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
//Tad arthaṁ karma kaunteya mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Samācara.//

**Dr. Patel:**
But here, sir, //parjanyād anna sambhavaḥ.// There, //yajñad bhavati bhūtāni, yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ, karma brahmodbhava viddhi brahmākṣara-samudbhavam.// That means //karma// as ordained by the scriptures, //brahmodbhavam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is //karma.// Otherwise //vikarma.// But they are doing //vikarma. Nunaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. This is //vikarma,// anyone working hard day and night for sense gratification. That means sinful, //vikarma.//

**Dr. Patel:**
And if you don't do the ordained //karmas,// it is //akarma.// No. It is //akarma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Karma// means according to the //śāstra's// direction.

**Dr. Patel:**
But if you don't do that, that becomes //akarma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vikarma.//

**Dr. Patel:**
[Hindi] //Akarma// means... [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Akarma// means no resultant action. When it is done for Viṣṇu...

**Dr. Patel:**
Then it becomes //akarma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Akarma.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Akarma.// But //akarma,// the... In this //bhāṣya// of Rāmānujācārya, he says //akarma// means knowledge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Knowledge. That is knowledge, that "I have to work for Viṣṇu." That is knowledge.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Akarma// means knowledge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
