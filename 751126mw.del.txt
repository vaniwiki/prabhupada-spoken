**Prabhupāda:**
...looks better, eh?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Than that Bombay idea? Yes, I think so also.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where is...? Saurabha has gone?

**Akṣayānanda:**
He's in Vṛndāvana. He's coming back here tonight.

**Prabhupāda:**
So it should be changed. Sitting idea is not to be...

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, it's nice. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...forget to tell him.

**Akṣayānanda:**
I'll tell him definitely, Prabhupāda. [break]

**Devotee (1):**
They are teaching communistic philosophy.

**Devotee:**
We went there to try to sell them some books. They were very hostile.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hostile.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why hostile?

**Devotee:**
Communistic.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are scientific men.

**Akṣayānanda:**
They say it's research.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Science, social science... Research. Research means they don't know. Just like Bon Mahārāja. Research.

**Prabhupāda:**
Research.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Research and research, but still don't know. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
If one is fool, where is the question of searching out? If he has got the right knowledge, why there should be searching? Searching means he is not in knowledge. [break]

**Harikeśa:**
It may be true that we have no knowledge, but we don't think we need God to...

**Prabhupāda:**
"Maybe" means rascal. As soon as you say "maybe," you are a rascal. Immediate. There is no other argument. As soon as you say "maybe," that means you are a rascal.

**Harikeśa:**
Well, definitely we don't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore rascal. [laughter] Therefore rascal. We definitely know Kṛṣṇa, the origin of everything. That is definite, not "It may be." We don't say "Kṛṣṇa may be." No. Definitely. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. "Here is Bhagavān. Here is God." That is definite knowledge. Therefore our professor...

**Haṁsadūta:**
Svarūpa Dāmodara?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Who has written foreword to my //Bhagavad-gītā?//

**Harikeśa:**
Dimmock.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dimmock. "Here is definitive..."

**Haṁsadūta:**
Version.

**Nitāi:**
"Definitive edition."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Definitive edition." That is the credit. Not "maybe." No "maybe," sir. That is rascaldom.

**Harikeśa:**
In our social science we find that God is only necessary to define the unknown. Otherwise He has no purpose.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, our God is not unknown. Known. We know God's residence. We know God's father, God's mother, God's activities, God's friends. Everything we know. There is no "maybe."

**Harikeśa:**
Just like in the former days when the savages saw thunderbolts...

**Prabhupāda:**
The savage... You may be savage. We are not savage. You may be savage, but we are not savage. We are civilized.

**Harikeśa:**
Therefore we don't have so many unknown things, so we don't need God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Harikeśa:**
We're civilized, so we have so many things we know now, so we don't need God.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we know everything. Who says we do not know? We know everything.

**Harikeśa:**
I'm playing the part... [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
We know everything. //Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idam vijñātaṁ bhavanti// [//Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// 1.3]. This is the Vedic statement. If you know God, then you know everything. //Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idam vijñātam.//

**Harikeśa:**
The materialists think, though, that the less you know, the more you need God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Harikeśa:**
The less you know, the more you need God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore we say they are rascal and fools. This is the... What is this "House of Soviet Culture"? So why don't you arrange a meeting here? Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
A nice place for a meeting.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Akṣayānanda:**
That's the best place for a meeting.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. What is Soviet culture? We shall challenge them. Yes. We can challenge them, because we know they are rascals. //Mūḍha.// [break]

**Harikeśa:**
Religion is simply to keep people satisfied, that's all.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Harikeśa:**
Religion is simply to keep people satisfied. It's the "opiate of the masses."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right, but you have no satisfaction even. Your culture is so bad that you are not satisfied even. Then you are better. Everyone is looking after satisfaction. So you have no satisfaction even. So you are less than animal.

**Harikeśa:**
Well, at least everybody is not satisfied equally, so there's no envy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because you are..., everybody is not learned, everybody is rascal; therefore he is not satisfied. If one is in knowledge he is satisfied.

**Harikeśa:**
But religion is just sentimentality. There's no...

**Prabhupāda:**
You do not know what is religion. Therefore we do not accept sentimental religion. We say it is cheating. Such kind of religion, we say it is cheating.

**Harikeśa:**
You can't eat religion.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Harikeśa:**
If you spend all your days just chanting, how can you eat? Religion means you go to the church and you just pray.

**Prabhupāda:**
And who says that religionists should not eat? Do we say...? We have ample //prasādam// to eat. It is already there. You are researching after food, starving dog. We don't research. There is food ready.

**Harikeśa:**
But we're just exploiting.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kṛṣṇa baḍa dayāmaya, karibāre jihvā jaya, sva-prasāda-anna dilā bhāi.// Kṛṣṇa is ready. Take //prasādam// as much as you like.

**Harikeśa:**
The Communists will say we're just exploiting.

**Prabhupāda:**
The Communists may say, but we don't say. They are hungry people; they may say. We are not hungry. Our food is supplied by Kṛṣṇa. //Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham// [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]]. He brings food. So why should the Communists? So we shall go further or return? Hmm?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Which way?

**Devotee (2):**
Do you want to go further, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
I can go. What is time?

**Harikeśa:**
Almost seven. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...road?

**Devotee (2):**
This is Curzon Road.

**Prabhupāda:**
Caitan?

**Devotee (2):**
Curzon Road.

**Prabhupāda:**
Curzon Road. [break] ...religion, we say "cheating religion." We don't accept sentimentally.

**Harikeśa:**
Well, the sentiment is the faith. The dictionary definition, sentimentalism is the faith.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Faith is good, provided you have faith on the superior. That is good.

**Harikeśa:**
So faith in knowledge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Knowledge means received from the superior. Like the child gets knowledge from the father. That kind of faith is required. If the child does not believe the statement of father and mother, he cannot make any progress. If the child does not believe the statement of mother, he does not know who is his father. So there must be faith, faith in the right person. Then it is all right. If you have got faith in the person who has got eyes to lead you, then he will help you to cross the road. And if you put your faith to another blind man like you, then it will cause disaster. Faith is required, but to the right person. Then it will be all right.

If you know that one barber is honest, then you can make your neck like this and he is with a sharpened razor. But you have faith that "He will not cut my throat; he will shave me." This is faith. And if you do not know him, and if you put your neck like this and if he is a rogue, he will cut your throat. That's all. The same faith, if you put it to the right person, you become cleansed, shaved, and the same faith put in the wrong person---your throat is cut off. So you must know where to put the faith. So our Vedic injunction is: "Put your faith to the //brahma-niṣṭam,// one who is God-realized." //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet samit-paniḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭam// [MU 1.2.12]: "One who has full knowledge in the //Vedas// and firmly fixed up in Brahman, God, you put your faith there." Otherwise there will be disaster. Right faith. [break] ...you call Prabhākāra?

**Tejiyas:**
I called him on the phone.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is here?

**Tejiyas:**
Yes. I don't know why he didn't come.

**Harikeśa:**
So actually the one thing that makes Kṛṣṇa consciousness different from other religious processes is the practical application of knowledge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Full knowledge, perfect knowledge. And other religious systems, they have no knowledge. They say of God something, but they do not know what is God. We know what is God and who is God. That is the difference.

**Devotee (3):**
But they have no pure devotee in which to put their faith.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (3):**
They have no one in which to put their faith.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever they may be, but because they do not know God, therefore it is cheating. Just see, India's capital, and so dirty thing.

**Harikeśa:**
You were saying about Eisenhower and Nehru?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
Nehru was trying to hide the villages.

**Prabhupāda:**
But any intelligent man can understand. Any foreigner who will come will understand how India is poverty-stricken by this picture.[?]

**Harikeśa:**
It seems like the strongest preaching point, or platform, is the presence of a pure soul.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Harikeśa:**
The presence of a pure soul, someone who is wrapped up actually in love of God, is sufficient.

**Prabhupāda:**
Faithful servant of God. He can preach. He is authorized. He has got the power of attorney. //Kṛṣṇa śakti vina nahe nāma pracāra.//

**Harikeśa:**
I was thinking on Juhu Beach, these men have been walking by now for four years, and actually none of them have heard you speak, or maybe a few, but now they are all coming and touching your feet. [break]

**Akṣayānanda:**
...two-year visas now, they must have more faith in you now, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Akṣayānanda:**
They must have more faith in you now in India, because they're giving us two-year visa. Faith must be improving...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
...in the right person.

**Prabhupāda:**
They should have that knowledge, that we are doing the best service to the humanity. It is better late than never. [break] ...position so they may not lose their faith.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Position should be pure.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Remain pure. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Earth teachers. [break]

**Harikeśa:**
...next conference.

**Devotee (4):**
They're all trying to learn Russian here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, for when the Russians come and take over their country. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...the talk amongst the high-court judges. So when there was fierce fighting was going on between the Germans and the Allies, so during their, what is called, relaxed hours, the judges were sitting. So one, the Chief Justice of Calcutta, he asked one Justice Mukherjee. So Justice Mukherjee was very... He was vice-chancellor. So he asked him, "Mr. Mukherjee, now the Germans are coming. What you will do when they come?" He said, "Yes, as soon as they come, we shall: 'Come on, sir. Come on, sir. Come on, sir.' We shall receive them." "Why?" "Now, you have taught us like that. You British people, you have taught us. [laughter] Our business is to receive. Anyone comes, we shall receive him. That's all."

**Harikeśa:**
And they will do the same with the Russians.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break]

**Harikeśa:**
It seems like they are preparing now by eating lots of meat and drinking a lot of alcohol.

**Prabhupāda:**
They cannot prepare us. That is the difference. Even they are preparing, but they cannot prepare us. That is the difference between fools and man with knowledge. [break] ...was existing? No. New temple.

**Haṁsadūta:**
I don't know. They're still in the process of building it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Make //samosā// and //halavā.//

**Harikeśa:**
For lunch?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
For lunch. [break]

**Haṁsadūta:**
I couldn't follow the numbers. I just heard that so much for sleeping, so much for the toilet, so much... The noise of the machine... I couldn't follow the years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Out of hundred years, fifty years sleeping. And fifty years balance, twenty years playing. And twenty years, old age, invalid. And ten years, frustration. //Bās.// [laughter]

**Devotee (5):**
Prabhupāda said Prahlāda Mahārāja said [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. Hundred years finished, and then become a dog. This is civilization. You got the hundred years for getting out of these material clutches, //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhī// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]], but one will not do that. How spoiling civilization.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In the Fifth Canto it is very nicely described how for each sinful activity a person goes to a separate type of hellish planet.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they do not accept it, such a foolish person.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Any sane man, if he found out what the consequences will be, he would listen to the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not believe next life. They have to dismiss all these ideas. If there is no next life... //Bhasmi bhūtasya...// Atheists, they do not believe next life. All big, big men in Europe, they say, "No, there is no life." Here also.

**Haṁsadūta:**
They will say, "We have no evidence, no evidence of..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Evidence is there. Still, you are so rascal. Evidence is you were a child. That is the evidence. Where is that body? A very simple evidence, but these rascals are so dull, they cannot understand.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They accept what is good for their sense gratification, and what is not good, they won't accept.

**Prabhupāda:**
And where is sense gratification? [break]

**Harikeśa:**
Everything is unmanifest in the beginning, manifest in the middle and unmanifest at the end. So why should I care for anything in this lifetime?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Harikeśa:**
If it's all unmanifest in the beginning, it's only manifest in the middle, and it's unmanifest again at the end, why should I care about anything this life?

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why you are making so much arrangement for sense gratification?

**Harikeśa:**
Well, I can enjoy while I've got it.

**Prabhupāda:**
But why... If it is not manifested, what is the enjoyment?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Harikeśa?

**Prabhupāda:**
You know Bengali?

**Devotee (4):**
No. Subhaga has spoken to me, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Harikeśa:**
Well, it's better to enjoy than to suffer.

**Prabhupāda:**
And where is enjoyment? The thief also thinks like that: "Let me enjoy by stealing." Then, when he goes to the prison, then his enjoyment finished. If somebody gives you so many //rasagullā,// that "You take this //rasagullā,// and after finishing, I shall beat you with shoes," then will you take? [laughter] This is enjoyment. No sane man will like to enjoy like that. "Take this //rasagullā,// and after this, I will beat you with shoes, as many //rasagullā// you have taken." Will you take it?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes, but I eat //rasagullās// every day, and nobody beats me with shoes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why the other day you told me, "I am now not... I cannot see. My brain is..."? Is it not beating with shoes? [laughter] Eh? Don't you agree?

**Indian man (5):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Everyone, but they are so rascal.

**Harikeśa:**
One famous psychologist, psychiatrist, said there is a pleasure and pain principle, that everyone wants as much pleasure as possible and as little pain as possible. So because we have to suffer and enjoy, why not make enjoyment as much as possible and reduce the suffering? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They are vacant?

**Haṁsadūta:**
No, they look occupied. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...big building.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Some kind of auditorium. [break]

**Hari-sauri:**
Art. Culture.

**Prabhupāda:**
Art. Some art. Art, music

**Harikeśa:**
It's very enjoyable to hear music.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [break] So why don't you come here?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Haryana?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, and take information.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. I don't know if this is their offices. We'll check.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Take immediately that. What is this?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Come at nine o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
So near. You can come. [break] It is published, that the wood... Now it is no green leaves. Why? What is missing? If they are so expert, inject something and it will have green leaves like that. [break] ...I mean to say, trucks, they are rejected in your country. We do not see such buses. What is this house?

**Harikeśa:**
It's a college. It's a girls' college. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
How to kill child. This is education. Huh? Educated girl means how to divorce husband, how to kill child. Is it not? Educated, modern educated girl means how to become unfaithful to the husband, how to divorce and how to kill child.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How to get equal rights.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, equal rights, that's all right. This is the education. The uneducated girls do not do this. [break]

**Harikeśa:**
[laughing] This is very funny.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Harikeśa:**
It says, "Invincible are the Korean people who are rallied firmly with one ideology and will under the brilliant rays of the immortal //juch//[?] idea of Comrade..."

**Prabhupāda:**
All ideas.

**Indian man (6):**
This is South Korea or North Korea?

**Harikeśa:**
South, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [break]

**Harikeśa:**
They are becoming very advanced, making big skyscrapers.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's a big hotel.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hotel? Oh.

**Tejiyas:**
Hotel and office. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Those who are not cooperating...

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They should be asked to leave.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They must cooperate. [break]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The problem that these foreign..., some of these foreign devotees that have come lately, they have been such loose devotees that the temple presidents, they want to get rid of them; they are sending them to India. Three people came from Rūpānuga's zone, and they were all useless devotees. They won't listen. They just ran away from Bombay. So I wrote a very strong letter to Rūpānuga Prabhu. I said, you know, they should screen the devotees before they send them to India. What they are doing is they are sending their rejected devotees to India. If any devotee is not good in their zone, they say, "Okay, we'll send them to India." But here we have such big projects that we need respons..., devotees who will follow the rules strictly and who will listen to authorities.

**Prabhupāda:**
So tell them. If they have rejected, and you also reject them, where they will go? Hmm?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, we will train them, but these devotees don't cooperate very much. [end]
