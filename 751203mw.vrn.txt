**Prabhupāda:**
He cannot give up this habit. A dog is made king, but he will jump and lick up the shoes.

**Viśāla:**
[in background] Glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [break] It is the grace of Providence you do not see that it is properly cleansed.

**Viśāla:**
I'm sorry. I will see to that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Viśāla:**
...Your Divine Grace. That is my fault.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why there is water? This water means the shoes, dirt, it will be dirty. So you have no eyes to see?

**Viśāla:**
I am blind. I am sorry. I will see that it is cleaned for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then become with eyes. Simply praying, what you will do? Do something practical.

**Harikeśa:**
This is the argument people always throw against us. "Simply praying, what will you do? Do something practical." They say this all the time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone will say that.

**Vraja-vāsī:**
//Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// So they are guests. They are coming. Kṛṣṇa says everything practical. He never says that "You press your nose and everything will come." He never said like that. "You become a //yogī// by pressing your nose, and keep your head downward, and then you'll become perfect and everything will come." He never says. And Arjuna also never accepts anything impractical. That is //Bhagavad-gītā.// As soon as Kṛṣṇa said that "You practice //yoga// by this way," immediately [sic:] Kṛṣṇa said, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me. I cannot control my mind." //Vāyor iva su-duṣkara// [[books:bg:6:34|[Bg. 6.34]]]: "It is impossible as to control the air." If somebody says, "I shall control the air..." So these things are there in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// all practical. Kṛṣṇa was accepted the Supreme Lord by His practical instruction and practical features. They are not following Kṛṣṇa themselves also. That is the difficulty. [break] What is going on here? [break] Private. Huh?

**Indian man:**
Rudra-yajña. [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Somebody is exploiting. Rudra-yajña. [break] ...any mention of Rudra-yajña? In the //Bhagavad-gītā// the word is //yajña. Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. Where is Rudra-yajña?

**Indian man:**
[Bengali or Hindi]

**Harikeśa:**
How does one stop cheating in a world of cheats?

**Prabhupāda:**
This material world is meant for cheating. You cheat, and others will cheat you. That's all. This is material world. It is not "how?" If you inquire, "How it is cold?"... The season is cold; there is no question of how. The place is for cheating and cheaters. So there is no question, "How it is cheating?"

**Harikeśa:**
So you can't stop the cold.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
You can't stop the cheaters.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Yes, it is not possible. But you can do everything by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the advantage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. You cannot get out of sinful action, but Kṛṣṇa can do it. Therefore He says, "I'll get you released." You cannot get released; therefore He says, "I'll do that."

**Harikeśa:**
So bringing it to a practical platform...

**Prabhupāda:**
Practical means it will be done by Kṛṣṇa. Your only business is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. You cannot do anything. And as soon as you think that "I shall be able to do it," then you are a rascal. Immediately you are rascal.

**Harikeśa:**
So only a fully surrendered soul can do everything perfectly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Harikeśa:**
A fully surrendered soul is the only one who can do things perfectly.

**Prabhupāda:**
He cannot do anything, even in his... Everything is to be done by Kṛṣṇa. But he has to apply his intelligence by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Even if he is intelligent, he cannot do anything.

**Harikeśa:**
Except surrender.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He can surrender, and Kṛṣṇa will do everything. You have to act very sincerely under the direction of Kṛṣṇa, and then the war will be successful, as Arjuna did.

**Harikeśa:**
So imperfect activity is a sign of lack of surrender.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] //...avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa. Rakṣiṣyati iti viśvāsa-pālanam.// You work sincerely, devoutly, and have faith that "Kṛṣṇa will save me from all dangers." //Rakṣiṣyati iti viśvāsa-pālanam.// "I have surrendered to Kṛṣṇa sincerely. Now Kṛṣṇa will give me all protection." This faith, that is the beginning of devotional life. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. Faith.

**Harikeśa:**
So this faith, is this //śraddhā// or //niṣṭha?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śraddhā.// Beginning, //śraddhā.// Then, when he is advanced, then he becomes fixed up: "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is protecting me." [break] ...and here is some Goddess Kālī, and nobody is living here.

**Harikeśa:**
No, and then they worship in that temple. That's a temple there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. No, the road is, er, gate is closed. [break] People in general, they take that "There is no God, and if there is God, He is now dead." This is general impression.

**Harikeśa:**
There is one nice thing I saw on one wall. It says, "God is dead---Nietzsche." And then right underneath it somebody wrote, "Nietzsche is dead---God."

**Prabhupāda:**
Nietzsche? Nietzsche means?

**Harikeśa:**
Nietzsche, that philosopher. He was the one who first...

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
Nietzsche first brought up the philosophy of "Everything is nothing," for the Western people. "It's all nothing. It all ultimately boils down to nothing. So there is no possibility of God."

**Prabhupāda:**
Śūnyavādī. Śūnyavādī. That is Śūnyavādī. //Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādī.// Śūnyavādī, they say, "There is no God, and there is nothing, fact. Everything is combination of some illusory things." This is Śūnyavādī. And the Māyāvādī, they say, "Yes, there is God, but He has no form." Therefore we have to kill both of them. //Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavād-pāścātya-deśa-tāriṇe.// The whole Western world are filled up with these Śūnyavādī and impersonalists. India is also nowadays, but there are, still there are devotees in the //ācārya-sampradāya.// They are fighting against //śunyavāda// and //nirviśeṣa.//

**Harikeśa:**
In South India there are.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Harikeśa:**
In South India I think a lot of the Rāmānuja followers are.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break]

**Akṣayānanda:**
If everything was void, then there would be no hope for living. So might as well die.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. By combination, permutation, you create, and if you don't want it, then avoid this combination. [break] Even in four o'clock time, visiting, if he comes at four o'clock, you let him come in. [break] //...gurukula// we require teachers for teaching the small children. So our these girls, they cannot take this charge of teaching?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, one is already teaching now. One is already teaching children now, one girl.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is he?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Her name is Ruth. She's English. Every afternoon she teaches the children.

**Prabhupāda:**
Indian?

**Akṣayānanda:**
No, English.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's also one in Bombay. She used to be a public school teacher in England. After the school is open she can come over here. And there's one in Māyāpur, but she's teaching in Māyāpur.

**Prabhupāda:**
Similarly, other girls, they can take up this.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...our guest. Because somebody is guest, paying guest, therefore we shall admit anyone in any kind of dress?

**Akṣayānanda:**
No.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We don't admit people who look like hippies or something.

**Akṣayānanda:**
That girl, I told her she had to wear a //sārī.// And she did for some time, but then again she stopped.

**Prabhupāda:**
That I am speaking, that //sa yadi krīyate rāja.//

**Akṣayānanda:**
Due to habit.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sakṛn nasnuta pahanam//[?]. That is the difficulty. It will be very bad example. People will think... They already thinking that "These are all hippies." That will minimize the prestige of the temple. [break] Jaipuria House they do not allow any hippies. You know that?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jaipuria does not allow any foreigners at all. They don't allow any foreigners at all, even if somebody is decently dressed.

**Akṣayānanda:**
One boy came a couple of weeks ago. He had long hair. But the next day he came back and shaved up. He's a devotee now. He's doing nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Akṣayānanda:**
So they will still come. They can become devotees. It's all right then.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Akṣayānanda:**
...doing, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If they come and they have long hair, but if there's a chance they might become devotees, I tell them they must tie up their hair in such a way that you cannot see it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. If many comes like that to become devotee, then it becomes a devotee place, er, hippie place. You give them chance to become a devotee. In the meantime, it will be known as a hippie resort.

**Harikeśa:**
That's always been a problem here.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is no problem. You can allow for three days only. If he does not change his habit, then he must go.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. All right. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...was in the beginning allowing, but they saw some disadvantage. Therefore they have stopped. [break] ...our Dhanañjaya?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's sick.

**Prabhupāda:**
Every morning he is sick.

**Harikeśa:**
He had typhoid.

**Prabhupāda:**
Typhoid?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes. [end]
