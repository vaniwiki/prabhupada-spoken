====== Morning Walk ======

**Akṣayānanda:**
...from Agra came yesterday, Prabhupāda. He wants to live with us. He knows Hindi. He's a teacher. He's a doctor. He's a writer. He's very, very nice. I'll bring him to you today.

**Prabhupāda:**
He knows English also?

**Akṣayānanda:**
English very well. Very humble, and he wants to teach. If he can stay in Vṛndāvana I think it will be very, very beneficial for us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Wonderful. I'll bring him this morning if it's all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
//Jaya.// He bows down. He pays //dandavats.// He said, "You're a //sannyāsī,// so I must respect. I'm only a //gṛhastha.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is the duty.

**Akṣayānanda:**
And he is also very intelligent. He's not just doing it out of sentiment. Very nice man. Older man.

**Prabhupāda:**
If a //sannyāsī// is not offered respect, the punishment is that he should fast one day. That is //śāstric// injunction.

**Guṇārṇava:**
What is the punishment if one doesn't fast?

**Prabhupāda:**
You must go to hell. [laughter] [break]

**Akṣayānanda:**
...also come two or three times before over the months, so I know he is serious.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let him come.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, he's very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is his age?

**Akṣayānanda:**
I think he's about... He's getting on. He's fifty, sixty.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is all right. Then he should retire.

**Aksayānanda:**
Yes. His wife has, I think, expired, so he has no problem there. And he looked in our //āśrama,// and he likes it inside there. He's prepared to live with //brahmacārīs// and so on. Very good man. His name is Mr. Ugrasena. [break] ...much colder today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, and it will increase. Yes. In December January it will be very cold.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. It'll be almost twice as cold. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...middle of January, there will be cloud, rain. You have no experience, last winter, anyone? Huh?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, I have. Still, if we're sincere we'll stay in Vṛndāvana even if blood and stool comes from the sky, if you want.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you expect that? [break] //...cāpāṭi,// you apply little //ghee?//

**Akṣayānanda:**
For the guests.

**Prabhupāda:**
And not for you?

**Akṣayānanda:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Because it's very expensive and not necessary.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Akṣayānanda:**
If you say it is necessary, we will do.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, in this season it is necessary.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Very nice. We'll do. That is nice. A little more //ghee// should be there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
A little more grain. Even little grain at night is all right, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you must eat properly.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. Then we'll do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
And try to keep some cows.

**Akṣayānanda:**
//Ācchā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. On the other land.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Make a shed immediately and keep some cows.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Viśvambhara, he is experienced. He will help. [break] ...necessary //vairāgya,// there is no need. We don't approve that. //Yuktāhāra-vihāras ca.// What you require for keeping health, but not to eat too much. But what is absolutely required must be done.

**Akṣayānanda:**
I heard that if you pass stool more than once a day you become a //bhogī?// You are called a //bhogī?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Aksayānanda:**
Does that mean a serious devotee should only pass stool once a day?

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't artificially do that. [laughter] First of all become //yogī,// then do it.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. Of course, it can only be done by Kṛṣṇa's mercy, but one should at least try for that.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// Don't try for passing stool once. [laughter] That does not make you a //yogī.//

**Bhavānanda:**
//Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā// [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Antara...// Yes. That makes you //yogī,// not by passing stool. [laughter] [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [Hindi] [break] Huh?

**Harikeśa:**
That will be it? The scientist and the egg?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
Okay. That's nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
You know that? What is that article?

**Akṣayānanda:**
The one you heard last night?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. When I was in South America I saw there...

**Harikeśa:**
South Africa.

**Prabhupāda:**
South Africa. There are many factories for chicken killing. So I suggested that the egg, you can analyze, find out the chemicals and...

**Akṣayānanda:**
Create one.

**Prabhupāda:**
Create one egg. That was my proposal. So he is going to create. [laughter] He'll explain how to create egg from...

**Akṣayānanda:**
From chemicals.

**Jñāna:**
And make chicken.

**Harikeśa:**
Calcium phosphate, and a little sulphur for the yellow, make some color, and cover it in plastic and put it in an incubator and let a chicken grow.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you eat.

**Akṣayānanda:**
That will be a nice article.

**Harikeśa:**
And if they can, they can beat us on the face with shoes, and if they can't, we can beat them on the face with shoes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Well, that's another thing. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...ly regret is that these rascals are going as scientists and big men. Simply talk. They cannot create. It is very simple thing. Put some chemicals together, and if you know the chemicals, then why don't you put it? And incubator put, then you don't require to kill so many chicken. [break]

**Ālanātha:**
In Sweden when you go on the street and you preach, "Everybody must suffer here," they don't believe, because everybody got an apartment. They have never seen a poor man or a starving cow or something.

**Prahupada:**
But he is himself a poor man.

**Ālanātha:**
In Sweden...

**Prabhupāda:**
But he has no knowledge to understand it. Why he is falling down from the skyscraper and killing himself? Why? A poor man commits suicide. So if he is committing suicide, he is a poor man.

**Akṣayānanda:**
So many. They all.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is a poor man. He falsely thinking that he is rich man.

**Ālanātha:**
We're printing now a book there with all the talks according to the scientists and according to the Christian philosophy what was lately in the //Back to Godheads// in America. Put it together in one...

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't write anything nonsense. It must be very solid. Otherwise, you'll be laughing stock. What you will say, it must...

**Ālanātha:**
No, just the talks you make. Just your conversations.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Your lectures only.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That's all right. One must be confident before challenging others. Not that theoretical. Challenge is no good. In all stages he must be able to defend himself from the opposing elements. Then such challenge is all right. [break] We are confident that this soul cannot be manufactured by any material combination; therefore we can challenge. And I can defend ourself in any stage. [break] //Channa, channa?//

**Akṣayānanda:**
//Chānā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Not //chānā// but //channa. Channaka ḍāl?//

**Akṣayānanda:**
Oh, //channa ḍāl,// yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. //Channa ḍāl// is good nowadays.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Chickpea //ḍāl// for winter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mixed with little //uraḍ ḍāl,// then it will be very palatable and very beneficial.

**Akṣayānanda:**
For at lunchtime?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. Very good. We'll have it. [break] //...ḍāl// will give you as much energy as eggs will any time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Practically the same thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
It contains protein.

**Harikeśa:**
Actually, it's a wonderful challenge. This big, big scientist, big, big brain...

**Prabhupāda:**
Big, big monkey. [laughter] "Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping melancholy."

**Harikeśa:**
And we walk in and put an egg in front of him.

**Prabhupāda:**
You do not know this? //Baro baro bandole, baro baro peṭ laṅkā dingate, matakare het.//[?] [laughter] This translation was done by one big professor of President's College, Professor Rowe. He was a big professor in the President's College. So these professors required to learn Bengali, so he translated, "Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping melancholy." [break]

**Ālanātha:**
There's some countries in Europe where they have absolute laws against selling books in the street. In these countries do we have to make something secret to sell your books?

**Prabhupāda:**
Secret? Why?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Sell in the shops.

**Ālanātha:**
Because otherwise they would immediately put you in prison.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where? Here in India?

**Ālanātha:**
No. In Europe, like in Switzerland. But when we go there for selling books, people take them like anything, but you have to hide before the police very carefully.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why? Why don't you take permission from the court?

**Ālanātha:**
No. It's not possible.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Have you applied?

**Ālanātha:**
They have very strict laws. It's also been applied for.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you have to prove: "This is very important book of knowledge, so allow us special."

**Ālanātha:**
It's especially different if foreigners go there. It's especially different if foreigners try to sell a book there. And we have... Like in Austria we have no Austrian devotees there.

**Akṣayānanda:**
They think it's an invasion.

**Ālanātha:**
Yes. We used to go there sometimes, and it was very good. People took many, many books. But sometimes they caught us, so...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, if they caught, go to the jail, and when there is trial you should explain that "This is very important book. The government should allow to sell."

**Ālanātha:**
If the policemen liked us. But the law is strict.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore you have to take defense from the law. You present in the court the professors' opinion, how they are giving standing order. Why the state should restrain distributing knowledge? Do they want to keep their men in darkness? You have to preach like that. [break] ...University is the most important university in Europe. They read our books. They order standing order. So why this loafer state prohibit?

**Ālanātha:**
In these connections, they always argue, "If we allow you to sell your books, then we must allow everybody to sell on the street."

**Prabhupāda:**
No. But you must consider the importance of. [break] Everybody submits application for becoming high-court judge. Will it be granted? There must be discrimination. [break] [aside:] Thank you very much for your kindness. Yes. I am very pleased. Thank you. [end]
