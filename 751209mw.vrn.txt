**Akṣayānanda:**
Sometimes I think our big building is too much Westernized. Disturbs the atmosphere.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Like you wrote in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// that when Caitanya Mahāprabhu had many disciples behind him, He was criticized that He should not take them to Vṛndāvana; it might disturb the nice atmosphere. We have to be careful that we don't disturb with our big buildings and things. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...transform into a nice park this space. [break]

**Akṣayānanda:**
....Prabhupāda. Did Giridharilal see you last night, from the Mathurā Janmasthan? [break] ...influence Dalmia, but I don't know. We haven't seen any results yet regarding the //gośālā.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...sandy. We want to avoid this sandy.

**Harikeśa:**
We should go back up, then. [break]

**Devotee:**
The people here say that this is the Raman Reti. This is the place, the most sacred spot where Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma would come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [break] ...parrot. [loud squawking of birds] [break]

**Harikeśa:**
...and went back to civilized life.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [end]
