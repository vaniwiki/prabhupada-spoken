====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.1 [with Translator] ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> ...samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

[begins lecture in Hindi] [translator translates] [aside to translator:] Just translate.

[01:19]

So if you have to translate, why not translate from English? That will be easier for me, and they will also understand. Huh? //Thik hai?// If he has to translate, then why not let me speak in English so that they will also understand? Huh?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
I will translate. [translates throughout]

**Prabhupāda:**
So Bhagavān means the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases: //brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. Absolute Truth can be realized in the beginning as impersonal Brahman, which is the objective of the //jñānīs,// and next, Paramātmā, which is the objective of the //yogīs,// and at last, the last word in the absolute understanding is person, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The ultimate issue is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just like we understand that in the sun globe there is the Supreme Person or the //sūrya-nārāyaṇa,// or the chief person within the sun planet. His name is also given in the //Bhagavad-gītā//---Vivasvān. The Lord says in the Fourth Chapter, //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]: "I first of all explained this science, this //yoga// system of //Bhagavad-gītā,// to Vivasvān, the sun-god." //Vivasvān manave prāhur manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt.// And Vivasvān, the sun-god, he explained to Manu, and Manu explained to his son. In this way, by the disciplic succession the knowledge has come down. So when we speak of //jñāna,// knowledge, it must be learned from a person. So Bhagavān, the last word in the understanding of Absolute Truth, He says in this //Bhagavad-gītā.//

So Vyāsadeva specifically means here, //bhagavān uvāca.// He does not say //kṛṣṇa uvāca,// because sometimes Kṛṣṇa is misunderstood by the fools. So //bhagavān uvāca,// this word, means whatever He says, there is no defect or deficiencies. For ordinary person like us there are four defects: //bhrama pramāda vipralipsā kara-ṇāpāṭava.// [correcting translator] //Vipralipsā,// cheating. //Vipralipsā,// cheating. So in the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa or self-realized person, servants of Kṛṣṇa, those who have understood Kṛṣṇa, for them there are no deficiencies. They are perfect. For this reason Kṛṣṇa gives the instruction,

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

One who has actually seen or actually realized the truth, you have to take knowledge from there. So we have to approach such person. Otherwise, if we approach some speculator, we cannot get real knowledge. So those who are speculators, they cannot understand what is God. Therefore they commit mistake that "God is like this," "God like that," "There is no God," "There is no form." All these nonsense things are proposed, because they are imperfect. Bhagavān therefore said, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. Because He comes for our benefit in the human form, the fools and rascals consider Him as ordinary person. If Bhagavān says, //ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]], "I am the seed-giving father," so we, every one of us, we know that my father is person, his father is person, his father is person, and why the Supreme Person or the supreme father should become imperson? Why? And therefore we have to learn from Bhagavān, the Supreme Person, full knowledge. This //Bhagavad-gītā// is therefore full knowledge from the full Personality of Godhead. We cannot change even one word in this //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is folly.

So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is following this principle. We don't manufacture any concocted things. We simply distribute the message given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And this is becoming effective practically. You can see practically these Europeans and Americans, Australians, all over the world, they did not know four or five years ago, or say ten years ago, since I have begun this movement, they did not know what is Kṛṣṇa. Although //Bhagavad-gītā// was being presented by so many //svāmīs// and //yogīs,// not a single man became a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. So our this presentation, because it is pure, without any adulteration, it is acting very nicely. Even the Christian priests, they become surprised when they see that these boys, their boys---they were Christian or Jews---they become surprised that "These boys, who were never coming to the church, they were never interested in understanding what is God, now, since this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is there, how these boys have become so mad after God?" The only reason is that we are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. We preach that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Kṛṣṇa says also in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. So this is being effective, that if we really want to understand //Bhagavad-gītā,// we must understand as it is presented by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the instruction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the movement which was given to us by Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction is this. He says, //āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. So He is asking everyone, especially //bharatīya,//

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is being conducted or was started by single-handed, myself. If all the Indian sages and saintly person, they take //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is and preach all over the world, there is great, great demand for it. Unfortunately, so many persons go there. One big //svāmī,// he said that "//Kṛṣṇa// means 'black,' and 'black' means unknown." Of course, nobody cares for his speech. Kṛṣṇa is going on, forward. Everyone is accepting Kṛṣṇa. But this is the most unfortunate thing, that our men go there to deprecate Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we should very carefully try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is presented by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. This should be preached, that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme, ultimate. //Ahaṁ saravsya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.// Even Brahman, Paramātmā, has also come from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is ultimate. He says, //aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. He is the supreme of all the demigods. There is no need of worshiping any other demigod. Kṛṣṇa says, //kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajanty anya-devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]. //Hṛta-jñāna. Hṛta-jñāna// means who has lost his intelligence. How he has lost his intelligence? Because they get from these demigods some temporary benefit. //Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]].

So our real problem is that we... Every one of us, we are the spirit soul, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. We are struggling for existence within this material world. So //manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]], struggle for existence. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that "Your real problem is //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]." We are eternal. We understand from //Bhagavad-gītā, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. So if I am eternal, //nityaḥ śāśvata,// then why I am accepting death? This is real question. But foolishly we are thinking, "I am this body": therefore we remain as an animal. So we should be interested to understand actually "What I am," //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// That is real solution of all problems. This is called knowledge. But sometimes we are misled by misleaders; therefore we still remain in darkness in spite of cultivating knowledge. But actually, when we cultivate knowledge under the guidance of real //guru,// then we can understand, //vasudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. This is confirmed in the //Vedas, Brahma-saṁhitā://

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

So spiritual knowledge means to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is the sum and substance, to understand Kṛṣṇa, what He is, not that concocting, manufacturing that "Kṛṣṇa is this. Kṛṣṇa is that." No. As Kṛṣṇa says, as //śāstra// says what is Kṛṣṇa, you have to understand it like that. So //sādhu śāstra guru vākya.// It is said that we have to accept knowledge through saintly person. Through //śāstra// and //guru// we have to understand. So Kṛṣṇa is accepted by all the //sādhus// and //ācāryas.// Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu---all of them accepted Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So //ācārya// means one who has learned, taken knowledge from the //śāstra,// authoritative //śāstra, Vedas.// Therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is recommended, //ācāryopāsanam.// If you want real knowledge, then you must take knowledge from the //ācāryas// or the //ācārya-paramparā.// Then there is knowledge. Otherwise it is ignorance.

So under the circumstances, whatever Kṛṣṇa says, Bhagavān says... //Śrī-bhagavān uvāca, mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha.// The real business is to increase your attachment for Kṛṣṇa. This is your real business. How we can increase our attachment for Kṛṣṇa, that is explained by Kṛṣṇa. So //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. The //āsakti,// attachment, it has to be done according to the system, //ādau śraddhā.// First thing is //śraddhā,// little faith, that "Let us go to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and let us hear what they say." This is called //śraddhā.// Then if you become interested, then //sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]]. Those who are actually devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa, you have to associate with them. And who is //sādhu? Sādhu// is described by Kṛṣṇa in the //Bhagavad-gītā: api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ...// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. He is //sādhu,// who is... So the fact is, //sādhu// means unalloyed devotee of Kṛṣṇa. He is //sādhu. Śuddha-bhakta.//

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmady anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

One who has no other desire than to serve Kṛṣṇa favorably, he is //sādhu.//

So we are sending all these //sādhus// all over the world, these European and American //sādhus,// because they have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness without any doubt. And it is becoming effective. Because we have got so many expansive centers all over the world, it is not possible for me to go everywhere. But these boys, because they have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously, they are doing very nice. And it is not difficult for them, because we have given this English translation of this book. We have got at least eighty books of four hundred pages, and they are preaching very nicely. And by the grace of Kṛṣṇa... You'll be surprised to understand that we are selling books not less than one //lakh// of rupees per day. So the preaching is going on very nicely. We request all Indians to take part in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and be yourself happy, be yourself //guru,// and deliver all other persons who are in ignorance.

And to become //guru// is not very difficult. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,

> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa
> yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

You become //guru.// It is not very difficult. How? Now, because you have to simply repeat what Kṛṣṇa has said. That's all. So Kṛṣṇa says everything in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. These four things if you accept---to think of Kṛṣṇa always, to become devotee of Kṛṣṇa, to offer obeisances to Kṛṣṇa and to worship Kṛṣṇa---these four things if you do, you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and you can preach all over the world. It is not at all difficult. So if you become sincere, seriously Kṛṣṇa conscious, then there will be no difficulty because Kṛṣṇa says,

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam
> [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]

If you constantly, twenty-four hours, remain Kṛṣṇa conscious, //man-manā,// then---Kṛṣṇa is there within your heart---He will give you instruction, "Do like this." So Bhagavān is not far away from you. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. He is staying within the core of your heart. But if you qualify yourself as devotee, He'll speak with you. But if you commit offenses, thinking Kṛṣṇa as ordinary man, then Kṛṣṇa will never give you instruction.

So our request is, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, that you study //Bhagavad-gītā.// You don't require... Because //Bhagavad-gītā// is the essence of all Vedic knowledge. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. //Vedas// means if you actually a student of //Veda// or //Vedānta, Veda-Vedānta,// then the ultimate goal is to understand Kṛṣṇa. And if you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa, however big Vedāntist you may be, you remain a fool. This is the conclusion of //Bhagavad-gītā.//

Thank you very much. [end]
