**Prabhupāda:**

> pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca
> janā na vidur āsurāḥ
> na śaucaṁ nāpi cācāro
> na satyaṁ teṣu vidyate
> [[books:bg:16:7|[Bg. 16.7]]]

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
There's something [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
They're connecting.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now here is the description of the //asuras// as stated by Kṛṣṇa. There are two classes of men, //asura// and //deva. Daiva// and //asura... Viṣṇu-bhakto bhaved deva asuras tad-viparyayaḥ.// The //devas, devatāloka...// [aside:] Don't talk.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
No... And whatever it may be, why you are interpreting? You stop. In the upper planetary system, beginning from the sun, there are Sūryaloka, Candraloka, Maṅgala, Bhūr, Bṛhaspati, up to Saturn, there are different //lokas.// So the upper planetary system, beginning from Sūrya, they are called //devaloka.// They are all devotees of the Lord; therefore they are called //devatā.// They are not pure devotees, but they are not disobedient to the orders of the Supreme Lord. //Śuddha-bhakta// means they do not come to the material world. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11], the //śuddha-bhaktas, nitya, nitya-siddha,// they do not come to this material world. They are everlastingly liberated soul, engaged in the service of Nārāyaṇa. This material creation is exhibition of one-fourth energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The three-fourth creation is in the spiritual world, Vaikuṇṭhaloka.

So in this material world they have come... All of us, beginning from Brahmā down to the insignificant ant, we have come here for material enjoyment. And in this material world, according to different desires and //karma,// they are getting different types of bodies. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur deha upapatti// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. //Karmaṇā,// by our work, and by the supervision of the supreme power, we are getting different types of body. So there are two kinds of living entities. One kind of living entities, they are trying to go back to home, back to Godhead. They are called //devatās.// And the //asuras,// they are not aware of the spiritual world; neither they are endeavoring to go back to home, back to Godhead. So Kṛṣṇa has described about the devotees in so many ways. Now He is discriminating who are the demons.

So for the //asuras// there is no knowledge what is the aim of life. So they are described in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// also,

> na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ
> durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ
> andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās
> te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ
> [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]

These //asuras,// or the persons who are in ignorance, in material enjoyment, they do not know what is the goal of life. Everyone is in the bodily concept of life, and they are trying to improve the condition of bodily comforts. The more we are interested in the bodily comforts of life, the more we are //asuras.// So these //asuras,// they are not very cleansed, //na śaucam. Na śaucaṁ nāpi ca ācāraḥ:// "They have no good behavior, neither they are very clean." Therefore, according to //varṇāśrama-dharma,// the //brāhmaṇas// are called //śuci,// means pure. But this //śuci...// The opposite word is //muci.//

So there is a Bengali Vaiṣṇava poet. He says that,

> śuci haya muci haya yadi kṛṣṇa tyaje
> muci haya śuci haya yadi kṛṣṇa bhaje

The purport is that if somebody takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even he is born in the family of //muci,// then he becomes //śuci.// And if a person born in the //brāhmaṇa// family or //kṣatriya// family but he does not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he becomes a //muci.// This is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā, māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. //Pāpa-yoni// means //muci,// less than the //śūdras.// If he takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim,// they are also eligible to go back to home, to back to Godhead. So even a //muci// or a //pāpa-yoni// born in the low grade family, if he takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he becomes a //devatā.// This is also confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// by Śukadeva Gosvāmī,

> kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā
> ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ
> ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ
> śudhyanti prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ
> [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]

So it doesn't matter where we are born. If we take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he becomes a //śuddha, śuci,// purified, and he is eligible to go back to home, to back to Godhead.

So to take the shelter of a pure devotee means he knows what is //pravṛtti// and what is //nivṛtti.// All our Vedic literature is meant for //nivṛtti. Pravṛttir eṣā bhūtānāṁ nivṛttis tu mahā-phalā// [Manu-saṁhitā]. These, all living creatures, who are struggling for existence in this material world, that is their //pravṛtti,// to enjoy this material world. But when one becomes inclined to //nivṛtti,// he becomes //devatā.// So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, which was inaugurated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is for //nivṛtti-mārga. Nivṛtti-mārga// means "No more material enjoyment. Let me make progress towards Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Therefore this devotional service, or //bhakti-yoga,// it is called //nivṛtti-mārga.// This is confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,//

> vāsudeve bhagavati
> bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ
> janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ
> jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam
> [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]

//Bhakti-yoga...// And Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, he was a impersonalist, followers of the Śaṅkara philosophy. When he became convinced about the Vaiṣṇava philosophy, he wrote one hundred //ślokas,// prayers to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Amongst that //śloka,// one of the prominent //śloka// is,

> vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam
> śikṣārtham ekaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ
> śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-śarīra-dhārī
> kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye
> [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]

He said that "This Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the same Kṛṣṇa. He has come to teach //vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga.//" //Bhakti-yoga// means //vairāgya-vidyā,// no more this material enjoyment---that is //vairāgya. Jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam// [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]. The result of //jñāna// is //vairāgya. Vairāgya-vidyā... Bhakti-yoga// is //vairāgya-vidyā// means that //bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. //Bhakti// means one is making progress towards Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and automatically he becomes detestful to the material world. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has given the example: just like hungry man. If he is given food, he takes it, but as he takes it, he becomes satisfied. And when he is fully satisfied, he does not require any more food.

There is another //śloka,// given by Yāmunācārya. He says,

> yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravinde
> nava-nava-rasa-dhāmany udyataṁ rantum āsīt
> tad-avadhi bata nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne
> bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca

He says that "Since I have been engaged in the service of the Lord," //yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravinde,// "since I have begun my life to serve Kṛṣṇa, since that time, whenever I think of sex life I spit on it." So therefore, when we stop our desires for material enjoyment... //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. //Karma// means to desire to be elevated in the higher planetary system, Svargaloka. [break] //...jñāna.// The //jñānīs,// they are trying to elevate themselves to the impersonal Brahman. So these are not pure devotional service. [break] //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]], no desire for material conception of life. So //jñāna// is also another desire, negative desire, to become free from this material world. That is desire.

Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said,

> bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kāmī sakali aśānta
> kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma ataeva śānta
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:149|[Cc. Madhya 19.149]]]

He said that //bhukti-kāmī,// the material persons who are desiring improvement in this world, in this life, and going to the heavenly planet next life... That is called //bhukti.// And //mukti...// Desiring liberation, that is called //mukti,// and... Or become one with the Supreme Brahman, that is //mukti.// And //siddhi, yogīs,// they are trying to achieve some success in //aṣṭa-siddhi, aṇimā, laghimā.// So everyone is desiring. So therefore Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma:// "A devotee of Kṛṣṇa is not desirous of anything, either //bhukti, mukti// or //siddhi.//" The purport is, so long you desire something, you'll never get peace of mind. And a //bhakta// does not desire anything. He is satisfied in any position, whatever is offered to him by Kṛṣṇa.

> nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve
> na kutaścana bibhyati
> svargāpavarga-narakeṣv
> api tulyārtha-darśinaḥ
> [[books:sb:6:17:28|[SB 6.17.28]]]

Anyone who is //nārāyaṇa-parāyaṇa,// he does not fear whether he is going to hell or heaven, because wherever he goes he is with Nārāyaṇa, he is safe. It doesn't matter whether it is hell or heaven.

That is offered by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His prayer,

> na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ
> kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye
> mama janmani janmanīśvare
> bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī...
> [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]

The idea is that a //bhakta// does not require any material happiness or distress. He does not require any monistic proposition to merge into the existence of the Supreme. And neither he desires any jugglery of //aṣṭa-siddhi yogam.// So in order to become //devatā,// not to become //asura... Asuras// are always against Kṛṣṇa. There are many examples, like Rāvaṇa and Hiraṇyakaśipu, Kaṁsa. There are many. So we should remember that //devatā// means who is fully surrendered to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. So there are many symptoms of the //asuras.// They are all described in the Sixteenth Chapter---it requires a long time to discuss; it is not possible to discuss all the symptoms---but one of the most important symptom of the //asura// is here described. How? //Asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur anīśvaram// [[books:bg:16:8|[Bg. 16.8]]]. Their main proposal is that there is no creator God. The modern scientists, philosophers, Western people, they don't accept that God is the creator of everything. And their theory of creation is the chemical composition. One gentleman has written one book, //Chemical Evolution.// They think that chemical combination is the cause of life. So the //asuras'// theory of creation is //aparaspara-sambhūtaṁ kim anyat kāma-haitukam.// It is a chance theory. But we don't accept. We are preaching against them, writing books against them. We are challenging this atheistic theory of creation.

So this asuric... The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is against the //asuras.// Every time, always, Kṛṣṇa also comes down to kill the //asuras. Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. [break] //Asuras// cannot flourish by their atheistic theory. Unless one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he has to be put into the different types of asuric //yoni// to suffer in this material world. And if we continue this godless civilization, Kṛṣṇa says here,

> tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān
> saṁsāreṣu narādhamān
> kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān
> āsurīṣa yoniṣu
> [[books:bg:16:19|[Bg. 16.19]]]

He keeps them always put into this asuric //yoni,// everlastingly forgetting the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and suffer in this material world. So, so long we remain in the asuric tendency, then we cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. That is also described by Kṛṣṇa in the Seventh Chapter,

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

So we should generally conclude that anyone who does not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they fall in the groups of //duṣkṛtinaḥ, mūḍhāḥ, narādhamāḥ, māyayāpaḥṛta-jñānāḥ.// So in the beginning we discussed //nāpy ācāraḥ, sadācāra.// So even one is short of //sadācāra,// Kṛṣṇa says, //api cet su-durācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. Even one is not fully in //sadācāra,// but if he has taken Kṛṣṇa consciousness fully, he is a //sādhu.//

So to take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness is made very easy during this Kali-yuga:

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

//Kalau,// in this age, if you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// then you become //devatā.// This is our program. So our only request is to you that in whatever position you are---it doesn't require to be changed---simply take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// and gradually you'll become //devatā.// That is the recommendation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ// [SB 10.14.3]. Remain in your place, but be Kṛṣṇa conscious. It is not difficult at all.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
