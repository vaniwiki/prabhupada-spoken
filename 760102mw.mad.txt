**Prabhupāda:**
What is the time now?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
[indistinct] 6:35.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] ...fire, explain.

**Harikeśa:**
Oh, because people can't see life in fire, they think there's no life in it, so therefore there's no life in the sun. But it's just like the Tata factory. When you see it from a distance there's many flames and fires, but inside there's many people who are working. Therefore just because you can't see life in fire doesn't mean it's not there. We see life in the earth, we see life in the water, we see life in the air, so why not in the fire? Is that all right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Now question, answer.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, one question is that the people in the Tata factory are not actually in the fire.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They are not actually in the fire.

**Prabhupāda:**
So they are also not in the fire. I say even if it is in the fire, there is no harm, because the living soul is not burned to fire. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Adāhyo 'yam. Dāhya. Dāhya// means burned. It is not burned. These are wrong conception. Because they have no conception of the soul, they think //bhaṣmi bhūtasya dehasya:// "When the body is burned, then the soul is also burned." If the soul is burned, then where is the question of //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]? How? In the Hindu system they burn the body. So if the soul is also burned, then where is //punar janma?// You?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can accept that the soul is not burned, but what about the body?

**Prabhupāda:**
Body is burned.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So how can any body live in the sun?

**Prabhupāda:**
So they are... No, if... They have got fiery body. As your body is made of earth, the fish body is made of water, and the so many others, different elements, so similarly, there the body is made of earth..., er, fire, fiery body. The so-called scientist, educationist, they... Everything they conclude according to his own position. Therefore //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. They think Kṛṣṇa also "like me."

**Acyutānanda:**
The fish is in the water, but the fish is not water.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, fish is not water, but he has got a body suitable for the water.

**Acyutānanda:**
So the people on the sun have earthly bodies...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
...who can tolerate heat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There is no heat. They live... Just like... They are not suffocated. They don't feel any inconvenience. They enjoy. Against the waves they enjoy. You cannot go against the waves. They can go, even small fish. You'll find within this there are so many animals, so many. How they are living?

**Acyutānanda:**
Also, science cannot explain how it is burning. Where is the fuel supply?

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
And there is no smoke, no waste.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nothing. They are all... Therefore we say simply "rascals." We have given this title to them everlastingly. All rascals, //mūḍha. Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam// [[books:bg:7:13|[Bg. 7.13]]]. How Kṛṣṇa is working, they do not know. This is Bay of Bengal. Other side is Burma. [break] ...they are so strong, it will never be drowned. Eh? [Hindi with Indian man] [break] The scientist says there is no life. Just disagree with them.

**Acyutānanda:**
No life?

**Prabhupāda:**
Scientists, yes, they say there is no life in the sun.

**Acyutānanda:**
In the sun.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they say in every planet there is no life.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, only the earth planet.

**Acyutānanda:**
Well, they have to qualify. They say, "life as we know it."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Acyutānanda:**
They say, "There is no life as we know it," but there's some forms of life that they don't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, but no, no. "As we know," but what do you know? You are rascal.

**Devotee:**
They are trying by radio waves to reach people.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]. //Sarva-ga,// this word is. //Sarva-ga. Jivātmā// [Hindi]...

**Devotee:**
[break] ...sending radio signals to faraway galaxies.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the meaning of their radios? Do you think that their radios are perfect? Do you think so? What, Acyutānanda Mahārāja? Radio perfect? It is not perfect.

**Acyutānanda:**
And I think the demigods and higher beings, they can disturb all their radio attempts.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, apart from that...

**Acyutānanda:**
Because they don't want trespassers.

**Prabhupāda:**
...how you can accept their radio machine are perfect? Because it is made by imperfect person, so how it can be perfect? If the manufacturer is imperfect, how he can make perfect machine? Nothing is perfect.

**Acyutānanda:**
Actually, the United States government has a whole agency for unidentified flying objects that people have seen that they keep secret so as not to frighten the whole America thinking that visitors from other planets will come. But there are many incidents of pilots who fly around in airplanes who see other strange-looking objects coming at them, flying at them, or people from the ground have seen many.

**Devotee:**
One guy testified that he was picked up and taken away for four days.

**Acyutānanda:**
Well, that was...

**Prabhupāda:**
What they are? They are police? No. Mounted police?

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes, mounted police.

**Prabhupāda:**
A mounted police here?

**Acyutānanda:**
Saber. Sword.

**Devotee:**
Oh, it's a stick.

**Acyutānanda:**
Oh, yes, //lāṭhī,// made like a stick. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why they are guarding here?

**Acyutānanda:**
I think for the horses.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They're exercising the horse.

**Acyutānanda:**
[break] ...house in Bengali. Is this where Swami Vivekananda...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. After coming back from foreign countries, he made his position here in Madras.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Beautiful building.

**Acyutānanda:**
In Calcutta we have a Life Member, Veni Shankara Sharma? You stayed at his house?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm, yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
So he wrote a book called //An Unknown Chapter of the Life of Swami Vivekananda.// And in there he openly says that he smoked a hookah and ate meat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is known to everyone.

**Mahāṁsa:**
He also had one boy who supposedly...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Was he praising that?

**Acyutānanda:**
It was... You know...

**Yaśodānandana:**
In Hyderabad there is a cook who used to cook for the Ramakrishna Mission, and he said they used to cook any kind of meat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
I said, "Did you ever cook human meat?" He said, "If they told me, I would have done that also." There was nothing beyond their diet. "Anything they told me to cook..."

**Prabhupāda:**
This building belongs to Vivekananda's society, no? Vivekananda House.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is that?

**Acyutānanda:**
That's Bengali. "The house of Vivekananda."

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with Indian man]

**Acyutānanda:**
They say Swami Vivekananda walked barefoot all over India at some stage of his...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Acyutānanda:**
That... This statue here is his life as a wandering //sādhu.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is a //sādhu?// Then question is, who is a //sādhu?// Who is a //sādhu?// You cannot say?

**Acyutānanda:**
One who is Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Api cet sudarācaro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. Unless one is cent percent Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is not a //sādhu. Sādhu-bhūṣaṇa.//

> titiksavaḥ karuṇikaḥ
> suhṛdaḥ sarva-bhūtānām
> ajāta-śatravaḥ santaḥ
> sādhavaḥ sādhu-bhūṣaṇaḥ
> [[books:sb:3:25:21|[SB 3.25.21]]]

This is //sādhu.//

**Yaśodānandana:**
This is the vehicle in which we travel.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Yaśodānandana:**
This vehicle is the vehicle in which we travel to all the different cities for making the Life Members and arranging all the programs in South India, this vehicle.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is your own?

**Yaśodānandana:**
We are renting.

**Prabhupāda:**
When I was in South Africa...

**Indian man (1):**
South Africa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Johannesburg. This beach reminds me of that beach. You were with me?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
All statues are crying here.

**Acyutānanda:**
This is Annie Besant. No?

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] //...avatāra// here, and she also came from Ireland to become //avatāra// here.

**Acyutānanda:**
I heard how she became interested in the //Gītā.// She was Christian, and her infant died. So she asked priests, "Where will this soul go, to heaven or hell? And why? Because he hasn't done anything." So she was never satisfied with their answers. So then she heard that there is transmigration of the soul. Then she became interested in the //Gītā,// India.

**Prabhupāda:**
So did she understand?

**Acyutānanda:**
Well, only up to transmigration of the soul.

**Prabhupāda:**
She admits.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
It was open? Is there are any doubt? [break]

**Indian man (2):**
...all practical things...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (2):**
...political things. Two and two will always be four. But we people don't agree so far.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You want five.

**Indian man (2):**
[laughter] We want five, correct. Four to make it five.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is a story that a grocer's son was doing business, and when he was given a five rupees note, so he was giving four rupees. So the customer said, "Why you are giving me four rupees?" "No, I do not know what is the exchange." "No, it is six rupees." So "No, father will be angry." [laughter] Means he knows perfectly well what is five rupees, but he is innocent when he was giving four rupees. And when the customer wanted six rupees, he, "No, my father will be angry." [laughter] [break] ...created a havoc by misinterpreting //Bhagavad-gītā,// all people. According to their whims, "Five rupees note means four rupees," by imagination, they have created havoc all over the world. Otherwise everything is there. //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. If we take Kṛṣṇa's instruction, then whole world becomes immediately happy. But they will not take it. They will manufacture their own: "Two plus two equal to five" or "three," not exactly to four.

**Indian man (3):**
So all anxiety and //duḥkha// have been created by the man himself.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They have created.

**Indian man (3):**
Nobody else is doing for him, but he created himself.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (3):**
And then he said, "I am in misery. I am in trouble." Trouble is created by you. Nobody has else created.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that mind is the enemy and mind is the friend. So we created our mind, enemy or friend, and we suffer for that.

**Indian man (3):**
Mind is very, very powerful. How to make use of that? Actually, mind is using the man; man is not using his mind.

**Prabhupāda:**
In the //Bhāgavata// it is said, //yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcana sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. In another line...

**Harikeśa:**
//Harāv abhakta?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā mano-rathenāsato dhāvato bahiḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. One who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he has got all the good qualities. //Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcana sarvair guṇaiḥ:// "All good qualities can be manifest." And //harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ:// "And one who is not devotee, he has no good qualities." "Why? He is so educated." No, //mano-rathena:// "He is hovering over the mind." //Asato dhāvato bahiḥ:// "He will stick to this //asat.//" But the Vedic injunction is //asato mā sad gamaya.// He cannot go to the real platform of life. //Asato bahiḥ.// They do not understand that this godless civilization is the root cause of all calamities in the world. [Hindi with Indian men] //Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.// The Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that //kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.// Twenty-four hours you have to do that. But where is twenty-four hours? You will not twenty-four minutes. [Hindi]

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena

[Hindi] //...Nectar of Instruction.// I have recently published. [Hindi with Indian man] There were no book for sale?

**Indian man (4):**
Book was not in sale yesterday.

**Mahāmṣa:**
That book is not available in India, Prabhupāda.

**Acyutānanda:**
It's a brand new-book.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, other books, they are not...

**Mahāmṣa:**
Other books were there. They were on the book table. There was a book table.

**Indian man (4):**
Where it is?

**Mahāmṣa:**
Many people were purchasing books. [Hindi]

**Indian man (4):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Prominent place [Hindi]. Keep in prominent place so that others can see.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Should be right at the entrance.

**Prabhupāda:**
And any book which is not in stock, you can note down his order so that you can send him later on.

**Indian man (5):**
He will come every day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (5):**
Mostly he approaching every member.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, recently we have published very important book, //Nectar of Instruction.// For common man it is very nice. [break] Yesterday's lecture you liked?

**Indian men:**
Yes. [Hindi with Prabhupāda] [break]

**Dhṛṣṭadyumna:**
...sleep on the streets. They've arranged this housing. It is very minimal. So what many of these slum-dwellers do when people are living on the streets is they come here, and they go back and live on the streets, but they rent out the apartment that the government has given them, and they keep the money. They go back and live on the streets.

**Indian man (1):**
This houses there? This is all rented by the government and given free of charge to the poor to clear the slums.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore //Bhāgavata// says,

> tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido
> na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ
> tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukhaṁ
> kālena sarvatra gabhīra raṁhasā
> [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]]

[Hindi] So three classes of men are there: upper class, middle class... You cannot change it. It is laws of nature.

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] Just like Vivekananda philosophy, //daridra-nārāyaṇa.// [Hindi with Indian men] European, American men are hippies. [Hindi with Indian men] How you can change this? [Hindi with Indian men] First duty is, first of all enlighten them with knowledge. That is required, not by external bodily comforts. [Hindi] [gets into car] [end]
