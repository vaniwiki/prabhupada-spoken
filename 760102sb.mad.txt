**Prabhupāda:**

> śrī-prahrāda uvāca
> kaumāra ācaret prājño
> dharmān bhāgavatān iha
> durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma
> tad apy adhruvam arthadam
> [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]

This is Prahlāda Mahārāja. He is one of the authorities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There are twelve authorities mentioned in the //śāstras://

> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ
> prahlādo janako bhīṣmo
> balir vaiyāsakir vayam
> [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]

This is the statement of Yamarāja about the authorities of //dharma. Dharma// means //bhāgavata-dharma.// I think I have explained last night, //dharma// means //bhāgavata-dharma. Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītaṁ// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. Just like our Mr. Chief Justice gives judgment on the law. So the law cannot be manufactured by any common man or any businessman. No. Law can be manufactured only by the state, by the government. Nobody can manufacture. That will not give us... If in the high-court, if somebody pleads, "Sir, I have got my own law," Mr. Justice will not accept. [laughs] So similarly, //dharma// you cannot manufacture. Either you are a very big man... Even Chief Justice, he cannot make a law. The law is given by state. Similarly, //dharma// means //bhāgavata-dharma,// and other so-called //dharmas,// they are not //dharmas.// They will not be accepted. Exactly in the same way, law manufactured at your home is not accepted. Therefore //dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītaṁ// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]].

And what is //bhagavat-praṇītaṁ dharma?// That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// we know, everyone. He came, Kṛṣṇa came. His mission was //dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya,// for establishing the religious principles, or reestablishing. //Dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. So sometimes there is //glāni,// discrepancies, in the matter of discharging the principles of //dharma.// At that time, Kṛṣṇa comes. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. //Yuge yuge sambhavāmi.// So this //dharma...// Kṛṣṇa did not come to reorganize the so-called //dharmas//---Hindu //dharma,// Muslim //dharma,// Christian //dharma,// Buddha's //dharma.// No. According to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. The //dharma// which is a type of cheating process, that kind of //dharma// is //projjhita. Prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa ujjhita,// means it is thrown away or kicked out. So real //dharma// is //bhāgavata-dharma,// real //dharma.// Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. Actually //dharma// means God and our relationship with God and acting according to that relationship so that we may attain the ultimate goal of life. That is //dharma---sambandha, abhidheya, prayojana,// these three things.

The whole //Vedas// are divided into three states. //Sambandha:// what is our connection God. That is called //sambandha.// And then //abhidheya.// According to that relationship we have to act. That is called //abhidheya.// And why do we act? Because we have got the goal of life, to achieve the goal of life. So what is the goal of life? The goal of life is that to go back to home, back to Godhead. That is goal of life. We are part and parcel of God. God is //sanātana,// and He has His own abode, //sanātana. Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ// [[books:bg:8:20|[Bg. 8.20]]]. There is a place ever-existing. This material world, it will not exist forever. It is //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. It is manifested at a certain date. Just like your body and my body, it is manifested on a certain date; it will stay for some time; it will grow; it will give some by-product; then we become old, dwindling, and then finished. This is called //ṣaḍ-vikāra,// of anything which is material. But there is another nature where there is no //ṣaḍ-vikāra.// That is eternal. So that is called //sanātana-dharma.// And the //jīvas,// we living entities, we are also described as eternal. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. And the Lord is also addressed as //sanātana.// So our real situation is that we are //sanātana,// Kṛṣṇa is //sanātana,// and Kṛṣṇa has His abode, //sanātana.// When we go back to that //sanātana-dhāma// and live with the supreme //sanātana,// Kṛṣṇa... And we are also //sanātana.// The process by which we can achieve this highest goal of life, that is called //sanātana-dharma.// We are executing here //sanātana-dharma.//

So //sanātana-dharma// and this //bhāgavata-dharma,// the same thing. //Bhāgavata, Bhagavān.// From the word //Bhagavān, bhāgavata// has come. So this //bhāgavata-dharma// has been described by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He says, //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]]. We are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is. But at the present moment, with our material connection, instead of becoming the servant of God, or Kṛṣṇa, we have become servants of so many other things, //māyā,// and therefore we are suffering. We are not satisfied. There cannot be. It cannot fit. Just like you take one screw from the machine. If the screw somehow or other falls down, it has no value. But the same screw, when you fit to the machine or the machine is not working for want of one screw, it is in disturbed condition, so you take that same screw and fit it, and the machine working and the screw becomes very valuable. So we are part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]], He says, Kṛṣṇa. So we are now separated. We are fallen down. Another example is just like big fire and the small sparks. The small spark is also fire so long it is with the fire. And if somehow or other the sparks fall down out of the fire, it extinguishes; there is no more fire quality. But if you take it again and put it into the fire, again it becomes spark.

So our position is like that. Somehow or other, we have come to this material world. Although we are a small particle, fragmental parts of the Supreme Lord, but because we are in this material world we have forgotten our relationship with God, and our... //Manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati.// We are struggling against the laws of material world, so many other things. Here also we are serving, because we are eternally servant. But because we have given up the service of the Supreme Lord, we have been engaged as servant of so many things. But nobody is satisfied, as Honorable Justice said, that nobody is satisfied. That's a fact. It cannot be satisfied. It cannot be satisfied because we are constitutionally servant of God, but we have been placed in this material world to serve so many other things which is not fitting. Therefore we are creating plans of service. That is called mental concoction. //Manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. A struggle. It is a struggle.

So we are making different plans, but it will not be successful. That much I explained last night, that we are thinking independent and we are planning so many things independently to become happy. It is not possible. That is not possible. That is //māyā's// illusory play. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā.// You cannot [indistinct]. Then what is the ultimate solution? //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. If we surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then we revive our original position. That is... Kṛṣṇa consciousness means instead of keeping so many things in consciousness... They are all polluted consciousness. The real con... We have got consciousness, that is a fact, but our consciousness is polluted. So we have to purify the consciousness.

To purify consciousness means //bhakti. Bhakti,// the definition given in //Nārada Pañcarātra...// Rūpa Gosvāmī... Rūpa Gosvāmī says,

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

This is first-class //bhakti,// that there is no other motive. //Anyābhilā...// Because here in the material world, under the control of the material nature, //prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartā...// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. We are under the full control of the //prakṛti,// material nature. But because we are foolish, we have forgotten our position, so //ahaṅkāra,// false //ahaṅkāra.// This is false //ahaṅkāra:// "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //kṣatriya.//" This is false //ahaṅkāra.// Therefore //Nārada Pañcarātra// says //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. So one has to become free, uncontaminated from all these designations, "I am Indian," "I am American," I am this," "I am that," "I am..." //Sarvopādhi vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.// When he is purified, //nirmalam,// without any designation, that "I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa." //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// This is //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.//

Kṛṣṇa is Para-brahman. He is described in the //Śrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā.// Arjuna... //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān puruṣaṁ śāśvatam ādyam// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. Arjuna recognized, and he said, "You are recognized by all the authorities." Prahlāda Mahārāja is one of the authorities. I have described the authorities. Brahmā is authority, Lord Śiva is authority, and Kapila is authority, Kumāra, four Kumāras, they are authorities, and Manu is authority. Similarly, Prahlāda Mahārāja is authority. Janaka Mahārāja is authorities. The twelve authorities. So Arjuna confirmed that "You are speaking, Yourself, that You are the Supreme Lord," //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]], "and from discussion of //Bhagavad-gītā,// I also accept You Para-brahman. And not only that, all the authorities, they also accept You." Recently, in our time, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, all the //ācāryas,// they also accept Kṛṣṇa. Even Śaṅkarācārya, he accepts Kṛṣṇa. //Sa bhagavān svayaṁ kṛṣṇaḥ.// So Kṛṣṇa is accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead by all the //ācāryas.//

So we have to learn from the //ācāryas,// not any common man or any self-made //ācārya.// No. That will not do. Just like we... Sometimes in the court we give some judgment from the other court, and that is taken very seriously because it is authority. We cannot manufacture judgment. Similarly, //ācāryopāsanaṁ,// in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is recommended. We have to go to the //ācāryas. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda:// "One who has accepted //ācārya// in the disciplic succession, he knows the things." So all the //ācāryas,// they accept Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Nārada, he accepts; Vyāsadeva, he accepts; and Arjuna also accepts, who personally listened to Kṛṣṇa, //Bhagavad-gītā.// And Lord Brahmā. Yesterday somebody questioned that "Whether there was the name of Kṛṣṇa before Dvāpara-yuga?" No, there was. In the //śāstras// there are Kṛṣṇa. In the //Vedas,// in //Atharva Veda// and others, Kṛṣṇa name is there. And in the //Brahma-saṁhitā//---Lord Brahmā, he wrote //Brahma-saṁhitā//---it is clearly explained there, //īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ anādir ādiḥ. Anādir ādir govindaḥ sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1]. And Kṛṣṇa also says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. //Sarvasya// means including all the //devatās,// all the living entities, everything. And the //Vedānta// says, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. So Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Supreme Person, //īśvaraḥ paramam,// from Lord Brahma. He is the distributor of Vedic knowledge. And Kṛṣṇa says also, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. This is ultimate goal.

So the //bhāgavata-dharmam, bhagavān, kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.// In the list of the incarnation given in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there is name of Kṛṣṇa also. But at the conclusion, Vyāsadeva says, //ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. He concludes that "All the incarnation mentioned here, they are //aṁśa-kalāḥ,// part, partly manifestation or part of partly manifestation." //Kalāḥ// means part or partly. "But the name which is mentioned here, Kṛṣṇa, He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.// [break] //Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.// So Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is accepted by all the //ācāryas.// And in the //Bhagavad-gītā// Arjuna says, //asamordhva. Asama:// "There is no equal to you, //asama;// and //urdhva,// nobody is greater than You." That is God. Supreme means who has no equal, neither anyone is greater than. Everyone is under. That is called //asama urdhva.// This is there.

So there cannot be any competitor of God. God is one. //Ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti.// But He expands in different way. That is explained in the //Varāha Purāṇa, svāṁśa vibhinnāṁśa.// He expands as //Viṣṇu-tattva.// That is //svāṁśa.// And He expands as //jīva-tattva.// That is //vibhinnāṁśa.// So we are also expansions of God, //vibhinnāṁśa,// a small fragmental portion. The qualities are there, very, very small quantity. But the whole potency is there in Kṛṣṇa. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. So there is one supreme living being, a supreme eternal, and that is Kṛṣṇa. This is... And to cultivate this knowledge is called //bhāgavata-dharma.// So Prahlāda Mahārāja, he learned this //bhāgavata-dharma// when he was a baby within the womb of his mother; he learned this //bhāgavata-dharma.// So the devotees---//śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ//---they are engaged with these nine different phases of //bhakti.//

> śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
> smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam
> arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ
> sakhyam ātma-nivedanam
> [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]

So they are different devotees who have accepted one of them. Just like //śrī-viṣṇu-śravaṇe parīkṣit.// Parīkṣit Mahārāja, he simply heard, listened from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, the //bhāgavata-dharma.// He simply heard. He did not do anything else. Simply by hearing. And //abhavad vaiyāsakiḥ kīrtane.// Vaiyāsaki, the son of Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, he simply explained //bhāgavata.// So both of them got the same goal of life, liberation. And liberation means //muktir hitvā anyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa avasthitiḥ.// This is called //mukti.// In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said.

//Mukti// means... Just like a person has fallen sick. He cannot work. He cannot go to his office or... So many disadvantages. But when he is cured of the sickness or fever, he again comes to his normal life. Similarly, when we come to our normal life, that is called //mukti. Mukti// does not mean "Now I have got two hands; I'll get four hands or two heads or five heads." Not like that. Simply to come to our normal condition. That is the definition of //bhakti// also. Real //mukti// means to be situated in //bhakti.// That is //mukti. Mukti...// Simply to understand that "I am Brahman," that is not //mukti.// That is //mukti...// That is like convalescent stage. Just like a man has no fever, but he is not cured. There may be relapse again. There is possibility of relapse, typhoid fever. So the //brahmānubhūti,// Brahman realization, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// it is //mukti// but it is not very secure position. One may fall down again. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukti-māninaḥ. Vimukti-māninaḥ.// They think they are //Brahma-līna.// They think that they have become //mukta.// But actually they are not //muktas. Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ.// He is thinking like that. Why? //Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. His intelligence is not yet purified. As soon as it is purified, then it is //bhakti.//

Therefore Bhagavān says that //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. He is a //jñānavān// that... //Jñānavān// means "I am not this body; I am not matter; I am spirit soul." That is //jñāna. Jñāna// means there must be //vairāgya,// detestfulness, that "I have nothing to do with this material world." //Jñāna-vairāgya.// If there is real //jñāna,// then there will be //vairāgya.// Because we are suffering on account of an attachment to this material world, so //jñāna// means that "I have nothing to do with this material world because I am not this material body." Everyone is engaged in this bodily engagement, so-called, so many "isms," all the activities of the world, because on account of this bodily conception of life. So when one becomes freed from the bodily conception of life he comes to the understanding of Brahman identification, and that is the beginning of //mukti.// That is not //mukti.//

Therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. As soon as one realizes that "I am not this body, so why I should be interested in so-called social life or political life or this life, that life, because they are all due to this bodily conception of life?" So when one understands that "I am not this body, so what business I have got, this bodily conception of activities?" //Prasannātmā,// "I have no responsibility. I have no more responsibility with this bodily platform," //prasannātmā,// he gets relieved of so many engagements on account of this body: "I am Indian. I am a Hindu. I am //brāhmaṇa.// I am chief of this family. I have to take care of the so many persons," and so on, so many responsibilities. And so he feels relieved: "No, I have no responsibility." //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. If he does not identify himself with this matter, then if the matter is lost or gained, what he has got to do with it? //Na śocati na kāṅkṣati.// Because you have got material attachment, therefore something material lost we lament, and something material we do not possess, we hanker. The two kinds of diseases. So //brahma-bhūtaḥ// means these things are the symptom: he is joyful, //prasannātmā, na śocati na kāṅkṣati,// and //samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// Then he can see, //vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇi gavi hastini, śuni caiva śva-pāke..., paṇḍita...// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. He has become //paṇḍita. Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// When these conditions are fulfilled, //mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]---then he enters into devotional service.

So devotional service is not a sentiment. It is most scientific, just to become freed from the contamination of this material world. That means one who is devotee, he is already //mukta;// he is liberated. That is also stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that,

> māṁ cāvyabhicāriṇi
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

So if you want to be //brahma-līna,// so that is... Actually //brahma-līna// means to be engaged twenty-four hours in devotional service. That is //brahma-līna.// There is not a second vacant without Kṛṣṇa's service. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me:// "I am seeing everything vacant without Govinda." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is thinking simply on Kṛṣṇa. And without Kṛṣṇa, everything is zero. So simply to make the material world zero, //śūnyavādi...// Just like the Buddhist philosophers, they think //śūnyavādi.// And the Māyāvādī, //nirviśeṣa.// They are practically the same. The Buddhists say, "There is no God." And the Māyāvādīs say, "There is God, but He has no head, tail, nothing." It is in the indirect way to say there is no God. What is difference? If somebody says, "There is no God," and if somebody says, "There is God, but He has no head, He has no tail, He cannot eat, He cannot sleep," negatively---the same definition in a negative way. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that //veda na māniyā bauddha haila nāstika.// Our standard of philosophy, especially Vaiṣṇava philosophy... Anyone who does not accept the Vedic principle... Because //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. If you do not accept the Vedic authority, then how you can understand God, Kṛṣṇa? That is not possible. So anyone who says, "There is no God. I don't care for the //Vedas,//" he is calculated as //nāstika.// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said...

The Buddhists, they decry the authority of //Vedas.// He had to do that. There was no way. Jayadeva Gosvāmī offered his prayer to Lord Buddha: //nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātam. Śruti.// In the //Vedas// there is recommendation of //yajña,// and in some of the //yajñas// there is recommendation of killing //paśu.// So Lord Buddha, he preached //ahiṁsā paramo dharma,// no killing of animals. So these //paṇḍitas,// they will give evidence that in the //Vedas// there is description of killing animals. How you can stop it? So therefore he said, "I don't care for your //Vedas." Nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātam.// Why? Why he did so? //Sadaya-hṛdaya-darśita-paśu-ghātam.// He was so much compassionate to see unnecessary killing of animals. //Sadaya-hṛdaya.// Therefore //ahiṁsā paramo dharmaḥ.// That was his... Although he is the incarnation of God... //Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra, jaya jagadīśa hare.// So the Vaiṣṇava can understand what is Lord Buddha and why he decried the authority of... Because there was no other way. So,

> nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātaṁ
> sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam
> keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare
> [Daśāvatāra Stotra 7]

So a Vaiṣṇava can understand what kind of part he is playing. So in this way there are different activities going on, and they have been taken as different, I mean to say, types of //dharma.// But real //dharma// is //bhāgavata-dharma.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is //dharma.// That is called //bhāgavata-dharma,// intimate relationship with the Lord, Bhagavān. //Brahmeti bhagavān iti... Brahmeti paramātmā iti bhagavān iti. Tattva-vit. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. There is no difference between Brahman and Paramātmā and Bhagavān. But still, there is difference. This is called //acintya-bheda-bhedābheda.// There are two kinds of philosophers: //bheda// and //abheda,// oneness and different. So these //bheda, abheda,// combine together. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy, //acintya bheda abheda,// simultaneously one and different. So other gods, they are also gods. We are also god. You are also god because god means controller. Your Honor, Chief Justice, he is also controlling the whole high-court. I am controlling this institution; you are controlling your family or office or factory. So in that sense everyone is god, controller. But he is not Supreme God. That is not. Supreme God is Kṛṣṇa. We may be //īśvara,// god, but Supreme God is Kṛṣṇa. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. That is the verdict of Lord Brahmā.

Even Brahmā, he is also worshiping the Supreme God. //Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye muhyanti yatra sūrayaḥ. Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ svarāṭ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. So God is //svarāṭ.// He is not dependent on any other controller. That is God. We are god, that's all right, but we are controlled even by the material nature, what to speak of other things. So we are not independent. Independent God is Kṛṣṇa. //Svarāṭ.// He is described as //svarāṭ. Svarāṭ// means independent. He is not controlled by anyone. That is real God. And we are may be god, but imitation god or small god. But the great... "God is great." That "great" God is Kṛṣṇa.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja says that //kaumāra.// The boys... He was taking the opportunity of teaching his class friend. He was five-years-old boy, and his father was a great demon, Hiraṇyakaśipu: "Don't talk of God." So in this way he was in a very precarious condition. Still, because he was a Vaiṣṇava he was taking the opportunity of preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So he was asking... The boys were very eager to play, and he said, "No, no, no, my dear friends, don't play. Let us discuss something about //bhāgavata-dharma.//" Therefore he says that //kaumāra ācaret prājñaḥ:// "Don't think that in the old age we shall discuss about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Immediately, in this age," //kaumāra,// "if you are really intelligent." Why? Is there any guarantee that you become old man? You can die at any moment. So take this opportunity. Until the next death comes you take this opportunity in the matter of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is Prahlāda Mahārāja's instruction. "There is no guarantee. Why you are thinking that way, that now you are five years old; you will live for five hundred years? No. There is no guarantee. At any moment you can die."

//Durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma.// This body, human form of body, is obtained after many, many millions of years through evolutionary process. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati// [Padma Purāṇa], 8,400,000 species of life we had to come through. Then we have got this body, human form of life, and civilized. Civilized, according to our Vedic conception, a civilized means //ārya, ārya.// When Arjuna was declining to fight, Kṛṣṇa condemned him, //anārya-juṣṭam:// "You are just like..., speaking like an //anārya,// not an //ārya.// It is your duty. You must do it." //Anārya-juṣṭam akīrtiṁ karam arjuna.// "You'll be defied by others. Don't do it." So an //ārya...// Aryan means who accepts this //varṇāśrama-dharma,// four //varṇas,// four //āśrama. Varnāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. The real aim is to go back to home, back to Godhead, Viṣṇu. So this is the process. If we execute this //varṇāśrama-dharma// rightly, then we gradually make progress towards spiritual realization. It is so arranged in that way, //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// not by birth but by qualification. //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. If these qualifications are found anywhere else, you should accept that. Even...

That is explained by Nārada, that //yasya hi yal-lakṣanaṁ proktaṁ varṇabhivyañjakam// [[books:sb:7:11:35|[SB 7.11.35]]]. Just like in the court, there is no such race or caste as lawyers. Anyone who knows law, he is accepted a lawyer. Similarly, the quality of //brāhmaṇa// is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā: śamo dama titikṣa satyaṁ śaucam ārjavam, jñānaṁ-vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. So you can train anyone. Just like you can train anyone as lawyer, you can train anyone as an engineer or medical practitioner, similarly, you can train anyone as //brāhmaṇa.// That is wanted. That is wanted. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is like that. We are trying to train some men as real //brāhmaṇa// because //brāhmaṇa// is the head, is the brain of the society. If the society has no brain, it is in chaotic condition. //Brahma-jānāti iti brāhmaṇaḥ. Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ.// So some section of the people must know what is Brahman, what is God, and they should preach all over the world. That is the greatest necessity at the present moment. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to do that, although we are captivating or attracting some younger section, especially in Western countries. But Prahlāda Mahārāja recommends that //kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. Training should start immediately from the childhood.

So we are opening one //gurukula// in Vṛndāvana to train //brahmacārī.// First of all //brahmacārī.// The society, the students, should be //brahmacārī. Brahmacārī gurukule vasan dānto guror hitam// [[books:sb:7:12:1|[SB 7.12.1]]]. Everything is there. Now we have to introduce these things. Otherwise the human society is already fallen, and it will fall down more and more, and it will be hellish condition, and so only hope is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So I request you all to take this movement very seriously and try to help us.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [applause] [break] Any question?

**Acyutānanda:**
Kindly remain seated. Kindly remain seated. We will have some moments for questions and answers, which will be followed by our cinema. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So far our philosophy is concerned, we want to be freed from sinful activities, because in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said,

> yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvanda-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

We are trying our best to become a perfect devotee of Kṛṣṇa. So to become a perfect devotee means he must be sinless. If one is sinful he cannot become perfect devotee. So according to //śāstra,// this animal-killing is sinful. //Striya-sūnā-pāna-dyūtā yatra pāpaś catur-vidhā// [[books:sb:1:17:38|[SB 1.17.38]]]. These four kinds of sinful activities, namely illicit sex, //striya...// That is also... In our Vedic culture this is common morality. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita even says that //mātṛvat para-dāreṣu.// Anyone, any other woman, the wife of other gentleman, she should be considered as mother. This is civilization. So what to speak of illicit sex? But people are degrading. That is another thing. But this is our standard of civilization. Even a great politician, he says, "Who is //paṇḍita?// Who is learned?"

> mātṛvat para-dāresu
> para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat
> ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu
> yaḥ paśyati sa paṇḍitaḥ
> [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita]

He doesn't say one has to take degrees. By behavior one should be understood. So these four principles, namely illicit sex, animal killing and intoxication...

**Indian man:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So these are sinful activities, and our position is how to become sinless. Therefore we do not recommend animal killing. That is not possible.

**Acyutānanda:**
Another question. [break] [repeating question] This is a world of //śakti// or energy. There is a worldwide rise in prices of energy resources, like oil, coal, gas and electricity. This means that there is a depletion of these energy resources. Naturally, there will be worldwide destruction of mankind and other living beings and materials in the near future. What are your views?

**Prabhupāda:**
So yes, these material things, they are energies. That is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā: bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. The petrol is also another form of Kṛṣṇa's energy. //Parasya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. Any energy. There are many millions of energies. //Na tasya kāryaṁ kāraṇaṁ ca vidyate.// Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do, because everything is being done by His energy. Although He is the ultimate source of everything, but He is doing everything by His energy. //Parasya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.// And it appears that it is being automatically done. No. It is not automatically done. It is done by Kṛṣṇa's energy. So this material energy is also Kṛṣṇa's energy. It is not a different energy. Kṛṣṇa says, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ.// Now, this petrol is liquid thing, so //āpa.// It is a kind of liquid thing, //āpa,// so it is Kṛṣṇa's energies. So our Vaiṣṇava philosophy is that Kṛṣṇa's energies should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So everything can be utilized for service of Kṛṣṇa. So when you use this petrol for Kṛṣṇa's..., spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if we can use one thousand or one hundred thousand motorcars using petrol for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is the proper utilization of petrol. [applause]

**Indian lady:**
[indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
[repeating lady's question] Kṛṣṇa says to perform your //sva-dharma,// so how does one know what is his //sva-dharma?// [to lady:] Am I correct?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is //sva-dharma.// When Kṛṣṇa says, "You surrender unto Me," that is your //sva-dharma.// Because you are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, your business is to serve Kṛṣṇa. Just like this finger is part and parcel of my body, so I say, "Finger, please come here," he immediately comes. This is the normal condition of the finger. Similarly, if you are really healthy, in normal condition, then you must be ready to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is your //sva-dharma.// If the finger cannot come immediately on my order on my head, that means it is not in normal condition; it is in diseased condition. [applause] Similarly, when you cannot serve Kṛṣṇa, that is your diseased condition. [laughter] [applause]

**Indian man:**
[indistinct] many incarnations, including Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa gave //Bhagavad-gītā.// That doesn't means that the author has not given all the gods, whether including Kṛṣṇa... [break]

**Acyutānanda:**
...nations, so...

**Prabhupāda:**
So that I have already explained, that incarnation---whose incarnation? The question will be: whose incarnation?

**Indian man:**
God. God.

**Prabhupāda:**
God's. So that God is Kṛṣṇa. [applause] You do not know that. Now learn it.

**Indian man:**
Is not Rāma a God?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Incarnation means somebody's incarnation. So who is that somebody? That is Kṛṣṇa. That's all. If you do not know it, you understand now.

**Acyutānanda:**
One more question, last question. [relating question] Is it necessary that a person should pass through the three //āśramas---brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha//---before coming to //sannyāsa?//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the normal rules and regulation, that especially //brāhmaṇa,// he must go through the four //āśramas//---first of all become //brahmacārī,// then //gṛhastha,// then //vānaprastha,// then take //sannyāsa.// This is for the //brāhmaṇas.// And for the //kṣatriyas---brahmacārī, gṛhastha// and //vānaprastha.// And for the //vaiśyas---brahmacārī, gṛhastha.// And for the //śūdras,// only //gṛhastha.// This is the process. This is normal process. But either one is //brāhmaṇa// or //kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// and //śūdra,// if he takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness he becomes above these rules and regulations. [applause] Yes.

> māṁ cāvyabhicāriṇi
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that it is giving immediate lift to everyone to come to the transcendental platform, //brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.// But general state is //varṇāśrama-dharma.// Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was discussing with Rāmānanda Rāya, He first of all said, "What is the aim of life?" Caitanya Mahāprabhu asking. So Rāmaṇanda Raya replied that "First of all to begin this //varṇāśrama dharma.//" So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //eho bāhya, āge kaha āra// [[books:cc:madhya:8:59|[Cc. Madhya 8.59]]]: "Yes, this is all right. But this is external. If you know something better, please tell Me." So in this way, step by step, Caitanya Mahāprabhu... This //varṇa, āśrama, dharma, karma-tyāga, karma-sannyāsa// and //karma-miśra-bhakti, jñāna-miśra-bhakti//---everything was described by Rāmānanda Rāya, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu not rejected; He said, "It is all right, but if you know something better..." Then at last, when Rāmānanda said... [aside:] Stop it. When Rāmaṇanda said that, quoting one verse from //Śrīmad-Bhagavatam, sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ// [SB 10.14.3], that it doesn't matter what you are; you remain in your post. //Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatām.// Through the oral reception if you hear about Kṛṣṇa, then you become perfect. That is the statement.

So this is required at the present moment, that you remain whatever you are, either //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// Englishman, Indian. It doesn't matter. You try to understand Kṛṣṇa, that's all. If you do that, then everything will be perfect. And that can be very easily done by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given this //mantra//---it is from //śāstra---harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. In this age, in Kali-yuga, it is very difficult to bring back the fallen population again to the standard of //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya.// It is practically lost now. The best thing is that all of them combine together---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// or even less than //śūdra, kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. Take to this process of chanting and hearing of the Lord's name. Everything will be all right.

[break] ...entities, we have no such distinction. It is confirmed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He was discussing with Rāmānanda Rāya. He was a governor of this Madras province under the regime of Mahārāja Pratāparudra of Orissa. And he was politician, but he was a very learned scholar in Kṛṣṇa science. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu was talking with him. So because he was a //śūdra// by birth and Caitanya Mahāprabhu was not only very exalted position, //brāhmaṇa// and //sannyāsī...// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu was questioning, and he was answering, so he felt little hesitation, that "Sir, You are so exalted. I am a //gṛhastha// and a politician, and how can I..." Immediately Caitanya Mahāprabhu encouraged him, "No, no, no, don't hesitate."

> kibā śūdra kibā vipra nyāsī kene naya
> ye kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei 'guru' haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]

He said, "Don't hesitate. It doesn't matter whether he is a //gṛhastha// or //sannyāsī// or //brāhmaṇa// or //śūdra.// If he knows Kṛṣṇa, he is //guru.//" He is //guru.// That is wanted. We are teaching that Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If one man becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious or knows... And Kṛṣṇa also says, //janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti...// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]] [break] "Anyone who knows..." [end]
