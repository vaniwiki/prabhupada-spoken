**Acyutānanda:**
"...Please, everyone join and say, '//Rāma ki jaya.//' " Nobody... Complete silence. Again he said, "Everyone say, '//Sai Rāma,//' " and somebody yelled out, "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa," and the whole audience said, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," then he said "Hare Kṛṣṇa." [dog barking]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, //Sai Rāma.// [laughter]

**Acyutānanda:**
Big Māyāvādī. And later on he had a very nice program for us. But the first day we visited---as I said, that he plays with snakes---so as we were leaving I said to Yaśodānandana Mahārāja, "I didn't see any snakes." He says, "Didn't you see that man on the //āsana?// [Prabhupāda laughs] That big one?"

**Prabhupāda:**
That he said.

**Yaśodānandana:**
That was just between ourselves.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Acyutānanda:**
Then he had a program with us, and he was chanting. He was a very nice man.

**Yaśodānandana:**
He came and danced with us also.

**Acyutānanda:**
And all the Śaivite //brāhmaṇas// doing the //yajña,// they came and danced with us like ghosts, like madmen. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, that is not very much liked by others. What do you think? Huh? When you say that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, it is not very much liked by others. Huh?

**Indian man (1):**
Everyone likes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone likes?

**Yaśodānandana:**
Except the Māyāvādīs.

**Prabhupāda:**
There are many Māyāvādīs.

**Yaśodānandana:**
They may not like, but they cannot prove the contrary. They cannot prove that Kṛṣṇa is not the Supreme.

**Indian man (1):**
Even in cinema, when they see the picture of Kṛṣṇa, the audience will feel very happy.

**Acyutānanda:**
Our cinema or on the outside?

**Indian man (1):**
Ordinary cinemas also.

**Acyutānanda:**
There is one actor who always plays Kṛṣṇa, N.T. Rama Rao. So once he came on the street and everyone came following him and touching his feet.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Acyutānanda:**
Because they thought he was Kṛṣṇa. Because they saw him playing Kṛṣṇa in every movie. So he had hundreds of people following him. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...yata āyur-vyayaḥ param.// Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //tat prayāsaṁ na kartavyam:// "This kind of endeavor you should not do." Exploitation. Not exploitation; I mean to say, unnecessarily trying for developing economic condition. The modern civilization is: "Exploit nature and materially be opulent."

**Yaśodānandana:**
It has been seen everywhere we travel that there is plenty of rice everywhere, there is plenty of food growing everywhere, but yet the government is advertising that there is scarcity of food in everything. But there is plenty growing everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
And reduce population. Kill it. Hiraṇyakaśipu was doing that.

**Acyutānanda:**
Birth control?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Prajāpati. He stopped Prajāpatis to beget children.

**Devotee (2):**
They said they are giving employment to many people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Devotee (2):**
The government says they are giving employment by opening these mica mines and so many things. The government says they are giving employment and work to many people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. So you like to be employed?

**Acyutānanda:**
In one mine recently there was a big cave-in, and how many people...? Three hundred men were killed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mica mine?

**Acyutānanda:**
Coal. In...

**Prabhupāda:**
In Bihar.

**Acyutānanda:**
Bihar. [break]

**Devotee (2):**
In Bangalore, when I was meeting one person and encouraging to become a member, he was telling that among the Durgā worships, one of the Durgā forms called Śānti Dūrga is under the mode of goodness worship. I just want some clarification.

**Acyutānanda:**
//Sattva-guṇa// is also //māyā.// Somebody asked, they said, "There is a Maṅgala-gaurī." So I said, "That means there must be some other Gaurīs who are not //maṅgala.// Why they have specified that this Gaurī is Maṅgala-gaurī. Then other Gaurīs are not //maṅgala.//" [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...saṁhitā// we understand, //sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya// [Bs. 5.44]. The //pralaya// is //amaṅgala,// and //sṛṣṭi// is //maṅgala. Sthiti// is also //maṅgala.// So Gaurī has got three functions, Durgā. [break]

**Devotee (3):**
A devotee who has tasted the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord can never, if he falls down, can never forget it. Does it mean that his journey in the material world is finished, I mean, is about to finish?

**Prabhupāda:**
Answer, somebody.

**Mahāṁśa:**
What was the question?

**Prabhupāda:**
Answer.

**Devotee (3):**
A person who has tasted the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord, if he falls down he can never forget anything. He doesn't act like an ordinary //karmī.// Does that mean that his journey in the material world is about to finish?

**Mahāṁśa:**
He falls down due to certain offenses, but afterwards, by the mercy of a pure devotee, he comes back. Because he has tasted the nectar of devotional service, he may try to enjoy the material world for some time. But afterwards he will be fed up again and come back.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's a statement in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that if one is engaged in the service of the Lord, even if he falls down, he is to be considered saintly. //Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, if it is accidental. If it is purposefully, then he is not saintly; then he is offender.

**Devotee (3):**
Accidentally means that //māyā...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Accident... He had former habit, and unknowingly he has done something wrong. That is accident. That is explained by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. Not purposefully doing wrong. That is //aparādha. Nāmnād balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.//

**Acyutānanda:**
The Deities' name is Rādhā-Pārthasārathi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Acyutānanda:**
The name of the Delhi Deities is Rādhā-Pārthasārathi. So how do we understand? Because Partha means Arjuna. So Rādhā, how does Rādhā get there?

**Prabhupāda:**
When Kṛṣṇa is Pārthasārathi, Rādhā is out of Him? Does it mean?

**Indian man (1):**
What you mean, Pārthasārathi is Śrī Kṛṣṇa.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. Yes. //Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir āhlādini-śaktir// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. When He is fighting, the //āhlādini-śakti// is there. It is not manifest. [break]

**Acyutānanda:**
...they have Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā-Rukmiṇī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Acyutānanda:**
Rādhā, Rukmiṇī and Kṛṣṇa. So won't Kṛṣṇa feel embarrassed to stand between Rādhā and Rukmiṇī at the same time?

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Why? Why embarrassed? Two sides. One side, Rādhā...

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes. One side, Rādhā, one side, Rukmiṇī.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that bona fide, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I don't find any fault.

**Acyutānanda:**
It's not //rasābhāsa?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Not //rasābhāsa.// But it is not mentioned in anywhere. This is mental... They should not have done like that. Several times He requested the //gopīs,// I think, that "You come to Dvārakā," but they refused.

**Acyutānanda:**
The //gopī-candana// comes from the lake where they say the //gopīs// drowned themselves, and that is near Dvārakā. Is that a true story?

**Prabhupāda:**
Maybe they might have gone. [break] ...these houses.

**Indian man (1):**
These private houses given by the government. Not the house---land is given. But a loan is... [end]
