**Devotees:**
//Haribol. Haribol. Haribol. Haribol.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
How do you like this idea?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
At Victoria...

**Prabhupāda:**
Anywhere, as we are walking, the //saṅkīrtana.// [break] ...tiresome.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Walking and chanting, sometimes it is...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Little bit. It's a good... A good place to do it is that Victoria Memorial, because there's so many...

**Prabhupāda:**
People.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...people there. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...places better than this place, then you shall go there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. [break] Madhudviṣa will be there in the morning. He leads the //kīrtana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's very lively. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...twenty years, they've never swept the street.

**Prabhupāda:**
Twenty thousand?

**Jayapatāka:**
Something like that: "...are sweeping the street." But only a few thousand of that are actually doing it. There's a big scandal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dishonest. They are producing only dishonest men. [break] ...get a boat like this? No.

**Jayapatāka:**
Not a dinghy. This is a bit bigger than... The dinghy is not suitable for rough water.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How big is your boat? As big as that...

**Jayapatāka:**
Forty feet. Boats in the back are about two-thirds that size.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayapatāka:**
Those two big wooden boats back there? About two-third that size, but not the same exact shape. Those are also big dinghies. [break] ...sagara, Midnapur, Diamond Harbour, that area, where...

**Prabhupāda:**
Those places are good places for preaching.

**Jayapatāka:**
I went there when I bought the boat. People there are so hungry, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Angry?

**Jayapatāka:**
Hungry. Hungry. They're very... I was eating a banana. I threw the peel on the ground and a boy picked up and ate the peel. I saw. They are so hungry. If we went there and distributed //prasādam,// so many people would be...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
...enthusiastic.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that Consulate General, he has promised to help for getting grains from India, er, from America?

**Jayapatāka:**
He's given me the law..., numbers, and he said that it's much higher than he is, but he'll give a recommendation if it comes to him. Apart from that, he told me how it's done.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why don't you take it very seriously?

**Jayapatāka:**
Well, he just told me last week. I was... I heard you were coming, so... The thing has to be done from Washington, D.C.

**Prabhupāda:**
So our men can do it. You advise them to do the needful. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
Caitanya Maṭha's devotees are from Midnapur.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Yes. And Diamond Harbour.

**Jayapatāka:**
And most of Mādhava Mahārāja's are from Assam.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They have Assamese?

**Jayapatāka:**
All Assam---the //pūjārī,// everything.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Like Nepal?

**Jayapatāka:**
No, they're a little bit stronger...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[break] ...ese considered to be Aryans? I don't think so.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are Mongolians.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I was saying that to Jayapatāka, that they're Mongolians. So the same criticism that everyone has said against you...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...that you are making //mlecchas// and //yavanas brāhmaṇas.// I think that that Mongoloid race is also considered like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not follow what you say.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, my point is that they're always feeling that you are creating //brāhmaṇas// amongst such low-class persons. So I see that they...

**Prabhupāda:**
If I am creating //brāhmaṇas,// how he is low class?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, we don't agree that he is low class.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. If he says we are creating //brāhmaṇa,// then where is low class? From logical point of view.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, from low class to high class, he says.

**Prabhupāda:**
Actually, everyone is Brahman. So from this conditioned life of non-Brahman, if we create Brahman, what is the wrong there?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Original position.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Ah. [break] Manipur.

**Jayapatāka:**
Many Manipur people are coming to Māyāpur now. Many. They wear a special type of uniform, the women, one pinkish dress.

**Prabhupāda:**
For seeing our temple?

**Jayapatāka:**
They are going everywhere. The Bengalis are going mainly to our temple. But they've come so far, they see everywhere, naturally. But also our temple without fail. [break] The Nabadwip Commissioner came, and he was so impressed. Now he is thinking... He is trying to... He is a little bit greedy that so many things are going in Māyāpur. He is trying to think how he can include Māyāpur within Nabadwip municipality.

**Prabhupāda:**
How it can be done?

**Jayapatāka:**
That he is failing to do, but he is thinking, anyway. He told me. So many taxes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Material conception.

**Jayapatāka:**
Bribe. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think we should return now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...from Vrndavana has composed some Sanskrit poems for Your Divine Grace.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which Śāstrījī?

**Jayapatāka:**
That you preached to last year at the festival time. There were seven //śāstrīs,// four of which came to Māyāpur, three of which blooped. One is still left. He is very eager to become initiated. He is very hard working and sincere.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What does he do there?

**Jayapatāka:**
He is teaching Sanskrit to the devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice.

**Jayapatāka:**
He is teaching the meter, how to chant them, to all the Western devotees and to the...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who's here?

**Jayapatāka:**
I never had time to go. Bhāvananda knows. [break] ...the Bengali language also. We have one copy at Māyāpur. If we have a festival here in Calcutta with a Bengali film, many people can appreciate it. Of course, English they also... That first //paṇḍāl,// we didn't have any movie then.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayapatāka:**
Those first //paṇḍāls,// we never had a cinema.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
Only //kīrtana.// [end]
