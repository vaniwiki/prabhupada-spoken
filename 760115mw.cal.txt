**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...real ones agree.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think this is their hospital here.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One of them, yes. I think they have... This is... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
These trees are brought from somewhere else.

**Harikeśa:**
Transplanted.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, they weren't here last time.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. [break] Just see how they are doing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Garden. It was a jungle. Eh? [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Helping to load the jeep. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...for foretelling, //lāvanyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam// [SB 12.2.6]. So all the young boys, they are keeping big, big hair. That is foretold in //Bhāgavata,// five thousand years: "In Kali-yuga, they will think by keeping long hair they become more beautiful." [laughter] [break]

**Madhudviṣa:**
In Kṛṣṇa's time everyone had long hair also.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Madhudviṣa:**
No? Well, Kṛṣṇa did, Balarāma did, and the cowherd boys.

**Prabhupāda:**
We don't find. That is normal. Kṛṣṇa can do anything. You cannot imitate Kṛṣṇa.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Also...

**Madhudviṣa:**
No, it seemed like that was the style during those days, long hair.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Also, from the pictures we see that the residents of Nabadwip and Māyāpur seemed to have long hair, the householders.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why this statement is there, //lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam?// If it is approved, why //Bhāgavata// criticizing?

**Harikeśa:**
Was long hair a sign of beauty in those days?

**Prabhupāda:**
It was not meant for everyone.

**Harikeśa:**
//Kṣatriyas.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[break] ...stairs first?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break]

**Madhudviṣa:**
...you were coming to Australia, we started to put in a chair lift up the stairs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Last year you asked us to put in one lift, so we had the company on the line, one nice lift. It goes on the side of the stairs. You sit on it and it goes right up.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is already fixed?

**Madhudviṣa:**
Well, it can be fixed very easily. We have the contractor lined up.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's enough reason to go to Australia.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Oh, yes. You don't have to walk up any stairs if you come to Australia.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. [chuckles]

**Madhudviṣa:**
And your garden is all finished.

**Prabhupāda:**
Finished?

**Madhudviṣa:**
The front garden is all finished. It is all, I mean, complete, with flowers and grass and trees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Madhudviṣa:**
We are growing our own flowers in the back now.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is wanted.

**Madhudviṣa:**
We planted five thousand carnation plants, so we will supply all our own flowers from now on. [end]
