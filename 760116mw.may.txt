**Prabhupāda:**
They'll never give us.

**Jayapatāka:**
They're willing to give; they just want a higher price.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the use? [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
He wants six thousand rupees. [Prabhupāda laughs] He has got three and a half //bigas,// about twenty thousand rupees...

**Prabhupāda:**
We don't want it.

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
This is all four feet. It used to be ten feet high. This used to be ten feet high. [break] ...the top during the monsoon. But according to the Ganges level the water is going up and down.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now what is the depth?

**Jayapatāka:**
It's about twelve feet now.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. [break] This is not our land?

**Jayapatāka:**
This sugarcane is our land, but this is not our land. That's why here the top became narrow. [break] ...here the one step with the pathway coming up to here and one step over there. [break] ...know this height was all right because you had requested to lower the height. Then we'll put a stairs going up and over there. Over by these steps, then going up and over the hill, there will be a stairway. So then we can make a nice sitting platform with a shade area.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He wants to know if this height is all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
This height?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This height as compared to the ground and everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is all right.

**Jayapatāka:**
And we'll landscape on this now, planting trees and things.

**Prabhupāda:**
And how this side? You can make it also slope.

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...clear.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, perfectly clear. [break] ...cannot bathe. We'll have to make more. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
This land will be utilized for walking?

**Jayapatāka:**
We're going to put trees and things and make it beautiful. At one time you suggested that there be cottages placed here.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Trees are very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
So we'll make this a park.

**Prabhupāda:**
Trees.

**Jayapatāka:**
Those trees which can grow on low land, they can be put here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...for trees, do it very nice, different types of fruits and...

**Jayapatāka:**
[break] ...suggested that for this year's Ḍola Pūrṇimā we put hutments here for the devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Jayapatāka:**
Just temporary.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Jayapatāka:**
Grass, for housing.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, there are so many rooms.

**Jayapatāka:**
There's not... Rooms only can hold about three hundred devotees.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But I thought there are already people living in the rooms, Jayapatāka.

**Bhavānanda:**
Some of the rooms are occupied for handloom, have big looms in them.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why not have rooms that side?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda wants rooms there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, you've been saying this a number of times.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That side. [break] ...unnecessary expenditure to have some cottage and again spoil it. Don't spend. It is better spend for rooms like that, that side, wall and rooms, and this should be used for only trees.

**Jayapatāka:**
Walkway.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm, yes. Within the trees, walkway. That will be very nice. Don't spend unnecessarily for cottage.

**Jayapatāka:**
For this year there was no time to make those.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then as much as possible you can do. What is there? Engage hundred workers and it will be done.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, we don't have the money to do.

**Prabhupāda:**
I will give you money. If money is the only question, I will give you money. You can immediately begin.

**Bhavānanda:**
We will immediately start.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, cottage... But make it little higher.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. If it floods... There should be a plinth.

**Prabhupāda:**
Plinth should be higher.

**Jayapatāka:**
See, right now there's no bricks available in the market.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Jayapatāka:**
Because they just started producing bricks in January, December 15th, and all the government has advance bricks. We wanted bricks... Right now it's very difficult...

**Prabhupāda:**
There are so many brick fields.

**Jayapatāka:**
But they've just started production.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just inquire. If it is available, you can do.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, inquire Jayapatāka.

**Jayapatāka:**
I'll inquire. Because we just ordered four thousand bricks.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayapatāka:**
We ordered four thousand bricks. It took two weeks to get them.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, but now it's later in the season.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can make a big tent here, big tent. So people may come: women tent and men tent. There is no need of rooms. That will be nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Where? Right up here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, on this land. Just like here you can have a big tent, there a big tent.

**Devotee (1):**
For the devotees to stay in?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Woman tent and men tent.

**Bhavānanda:**
We have enough rooms for the women.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's all right.

**Jayapatāka:**
We're going to make a women's tent...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. You can have a tent. If there is extra men they can live in this tent.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Supposing there are bricks available, should they try to build?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Immediately.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's better.

**Jayapatāka:**
We can start, but I'm doubtful whether we'll get enough bricks to finish. That's only my point: if I start and don't finish it...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But there's no harm.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no harm.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda said let's do what we can do.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Begin.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] ..."victorious flag," Jayapatāka. [laughter] [break] ...to walk in this place. Very nice. Oh, yes. Sun is rising. [break] ...dolls?

**Jayapatāka:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Jayapatāka:**
All the dollmakers have gone to Los Angeles.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. All right. [break] ...bricks are available, you can begin immediately. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can make tent here?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, this is better place than up there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You can make tent here.

**Jayapatāka:**
We put much dirt here. This land is a bit raised now. We can just open them out here.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. Anywhere you can... Here, you can make tent here, here. Just near the...

**Jayapatāka:**
Some //sābjis// are growing there. We can make some place.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (2):**
This place is already open.

**Devotee (3):**
Over here will be open? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...and people can live there. [break] ...very nice, facing east. Very good. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...are the handlooms. The dispensary is here. Then here men are living. Then, from this side over, the women are living.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's ni... [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Separate.

**Jayapatāka:**
Separate. Then the //prasādam// pavilion and kitchen are there. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...dispensary, I can give you some formulas for general diseases. One has got little fever, you give that //miṣṭa.// One has got some sores, you give some ointment; without any doctor's advice.

**Bhavānanda:**
We need, Śrīla Prabhupāda. For all those little things we need.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I will give you so many formulas.

**Bhavānanda:**
For boil also?

**Prabhupāda:**
Anything. All common disease. You have got cough? Take this //miṣṭa.// Just first of all find out what are the general complaints.

**Jayapatāka:**
For several... For some time practically no one has been bed case, but little things---cuts, bruise, cough, cold...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Many formulas I can give you.

**Bhavānanda:**
There is one woman from England. She is in charge of our dispensary. I can send her by today?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bhavānanda:**
You can give her the... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...mixture. Stock medicine, that is called. [break] ...consulting doctor, without any harm you can give. Just like homeopathic. So now these are vacant, why these doors are not closed?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This one is utilized.

**Jayapatāka:**
This is our spinning room, workroom. They just left it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These are handloom departments, the whole... How many rooms?

**Bhavānanda:**
Five rooms.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Five or six rooms.

**Jayapatāka:**
Nine rooms? No. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that's nice. Very good. [break] ...surprised that "In temple, why handloom? What kind of temple it is?" They will criticize like that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Really?

**Prabhupāda:**
They'll... They get one point: "Oh, here is some fault." And then, "They're not worshiping? They are going handloom?"

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Here is the moon. There is one dark spot."

**Prabhupāda:**
But the rascals do not know Kṛṣṇa says, //svakarmana tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ.// Whatever he knows, he can work on it, and that way he can get perfection, provided he is Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is wanted. Otherwise people think, misunderstand, that "They are parasites." Why we should be parasite? We should work for Kṛṣṇa. That's all. It is not that because //sannyāsī// and //brahmacārī,// you'll be able. No. Everyone. //Svakarmaṇā.// Kṛṣṇa says, //svakarmaṇā:// "Whatever talent you have got, you can serve Me and be perfect." That is the program. They are preparing cloth for the devotees, not for business. Therefore he is serving Kṛṣṇa. To serve devotee and to serve Kṛṣṇa, there is no difference. [break] So proper watering is going on?

**Jayapatāka:**
Actually, these places are very far from water. We have to put some other line to make it very efficient. Now they're just taking by bucket.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you can join some pipeline. Make a water storage, and from pipeline it will be supplied everywhere. Make water storage on the roof, on the roof.

**Jayapatāka:**
We have... On that corner room there in the kitchen, that's one water storage.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
That supplies this whole side.

**Prabhupāda:**
So by pump store water and by pipe distribute.

**Jayapatāka:**
This is what the Gargamuni's money, as we get, we're using for these programs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why it is being broken again?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Why are these rooms being broken?

**Jayapatāka:**
This is... We're putting on the other side the doorway. You commented that "Why the door should be facing inside?"

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. No inside store.

**Jayapatāka:**
It's facing outside.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You can...

**Jayapatāka:**
It's already finished. We're just going to...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, these are stores.

**Jayapatāka:**
Bookstore and...

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes. We're going to make a small entrance door on this side.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Cloth store?

**Bhavānanda:**
Cloth and bookstore.

**Jayapatāka:**
Many people request that we sell our cloth, because they say they don't get such nice cloth in the market.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, bookstore, //prasāda// store and this... Yes. //Prasāda.// Make five.

**Jayapatāka:**
Right now we have four stores, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayapatāka:**
We have four fronts.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
On that side?

**Jayapatāka:**
There are books, cloth, //prasāda.// Then?

**Prabhupāda:**
And... Books, //prasādam// and cloth. [Bengali with devotee]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about //mṛdaṅga?//

**Prabhupāda:**
And //mṛdaṅga?// Why not appoint one //mṛdaṅga// maker? He can sell outside, and whatever he makes we shall take.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, we need them for America.

**Prabhupāda:**
One utensils, //karatāla// seller.

**Jayapatāka:**
I can... We can have our own people. Just as the store owners are making outside, we can make outside with them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why outside? We shall make here. Simply you require the manufacturer.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They can manufacture brass items?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
To make //karatālas...// To make //mṛdaṅgas// doesn't require much capital, but to make //karatālas// requires a lot of capital because the metal is very expensive.

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall invest. If we get good manufacturer, we shall invest. What is the capital wanted?

**Jayapatāka:**
About four, five thousand rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, we shall invest.

**Jayapatāka:**
The //gurukula// is living on this side. And they're having classes in this original house. [break]

**Devotee:**
[laughter] What?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bidis.//

**Jayapatāka:**
Many people want to open up a shop. They'll pay for the... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...tulasī...//

**Jayapatāka:**
Our land.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why not employ one man to manfacture //tulasī// beads? Yes. There are many experts.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They have to live here as devotee?

**Jayapatāka:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, let them manufacture. That will make him devotee.

**Bhavānanda:**
On the right here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is our nursery for our landscaping.

**Prabhupāda:**
So this is nice. It is very... It will be very nice to live in these rooms. What is the cost of this //kattan?//

**Jayapatāka:**
Of?

**Prabhupāda:**
What do we pay?

**Jayapatāka:**
Bed, the small bed, about twenty-five, thirty rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Jayapatāka:**
And the bigger ones, a full man size, about forty, forty-five.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. It is nice.

**Jayapatāka:**
That's solid wood with //mingo//[?] top or //turta//[?] top. [break]

**Bhavānanda:**
...stay here.

**Prabhupāda:**
How many boys to stay in one room?

**Bhavānanda:**
Two boys to three boys, depending on their size. Little ones, three and four, and the bigger boys---ten, twelve years old---two. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...rooms.

**Bhavānanda:**
These are the remnants of old dioramas that we had.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means you have broken them?

**Bhavānanda:**
They were broken.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Broken by?

**Jayapatāka:**
Time. They were clay. They started just falling... No doll maker is here. After one year they started to fall apart.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is this last years' exhibit?

**Bhavānanda:**
From three years ago.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Three years ago. Last year's are still good?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they break.

**Bhavānanda:**
Some. The //Pañca-tattva// and [indistinct].

**Jayapatāka:**
They should have been put in the Ganges.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, how it breaks? They keep it for years, and you broke them? How you...? How you broke? Automatically?

**Jayapatāka:**
No, because there was no place to store them, by moving them and moving them from different rooms, then gradually they broke.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there are so many rooms. You could not make any store?

**Jayapatāka:**
First they were in the building to here. When they moved it, then many became damaged. And somebody came in and vandaled them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayapatāka:**
Somebody came in and destroyed them, made them...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, somebody came in?

**Jayapatāka:**
Vandalized.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. You are so careful. That is the defect. Yes. Somebody broke in, these rooms. [break] We have got so many enemies, and you did not take care of it. [break] Where these... When these pictures will begin?

**Jayapatāka:**
Over on that side we're putting the stones. The stones should be finished about in one week. Then we're going to start the pictures. Already there's a few frames they're ready to start on that side.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's very nice how they..., the way they're putting stones... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Begin immediately. Otherwise...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You won't finish.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why you are spoiling space by making these arches? You could have used the whole place.

**Jayapatāka:**
Having the arches, when they're all painted it will be very attractive.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] ...attractive, it is going to be very expensive.

**Jayapatāka:**
Each arches cost only fifteen rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. [break] ...will be written on the arches?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You can see down there how they have done.

**Jayapatāka:**
They're putting a very nice stone. Rose quartz.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that... The stones and everything cost fifteen rupees?

**Jayapatāka:**
Well... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Vandalism, no? Then what is to be done? [break] ...big doors, why it is open? This should be open when car is going. Otherwise not.

**Jayapatāka:**
[Bengali to gatekeeper]

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayapatāka:**
I think he opened it for Your Divine Grace to go.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, close it. Simply...

**Jayapatāka:**
[Bengali to gatekeeper]

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is in charge?

**Devotee:**
[Bengali]

**Bhavānanda:**
It's normally closed, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...spending money unnecessarily. And no...

**Jayapatāka:**
This wall was... We only got the money for building all this a month and a half ago. Then this wall is just plastered. It takes two months to dry the wall. If you paint before two months, then the paint will come off. Therefore, we're giving this two months. We made the arch and now we're going to start the painting. [break] ...immediately paint it right after plastering, and the paint doesn't stick. We thought that by doing this the wall would be so beautiful and impressive that the pictures will be more accented.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do it. [break] ...foolish person in the whole world. [laughter] You allow vandals to come and break your dolls. [break] ...give them protection, even to the dolls. [break] ...made with so much labor, and you allowed the vandals to come in?

**Jayapatāka:**
Actually, I think it was our own children.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Anyway, why did you not keep it properly? [break] ...painting will begin?

**Jayapatāka:**
Begin right away, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This week.

**Prabhupāda:**
These arches will be filled up with stones?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes. But there are so many arches that are already cleared. We have enough to start a few... Gopāla Kṛṣṇa said that Rāmeśvara was going to send the funds. We have enough money to start a few arches as long as his funds come soon. But if he delays with the funds, then it will be difficult, because we don't have very much money now.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this cottage?

**Jayapatāka:**
These are for making //gūr.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. This is our land?

**Jayapatāka:**
No, this is our night guardsman.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] ...the //gūr?//

**Jayapatāka:**
We use it the whole year for the sweetening in the different preparations of //prasāda.//

**Prabhupāda:**
We use ourself.

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes. We don't...

**Prabhupāda:**
Sell.

**Jayapatāka:**
No. We don't have surplus yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] You also? [laughter]

**Jayapatāka:**
Arch or anything be put on this gate?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayapatāka:**
Should we put any little arch on this gate?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, why not? Later on. It is not very urgent. [break]

**Śatadhanya:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Other one?

**Jayapatāka:**
Exit. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...arrange it so they don't know how to use it. They get caught.

**Prabhupāda:**
Wherefrom you got it?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Where did you get it?

**Jayapatāka:**
This was manufactured in Calcutta.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Special made? Specially made.

**Bhavānanda:**
This is American subway.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Bhavānanda:**
Engineering. To keep people going in single file.

**Jayapatāka:**
There's no other door like this exactly.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...in India. It's the only one in India.

**Bhavānanda:**
Otherwise the people come and crowd up at the exit, and then, when we open it up, everyone falls down.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is... [break] ...place to be utilized?

**Bhavānanda:**
This will be playpen. This will be for the children, the little children, to stay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh? Why?

**Bhavānanda:**
So many times there are always little babies. Their mothers are working, and they get into trouble, so this will be a nice area for them to play around in. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...abide by these rules?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...such hall like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I have never seen such a big hall like this anywhere else, for eating, //prasādam// hall, I mean.

**Prabhupāda:**
Railway station.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Only. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Bombay railway station. Yes. Bombay railway station is little higher, that's all. Like this.

**Śatadhanya:**
The sound in here is pretty good. [break]

**Bhavānanda:**
This is for... We use for soaking paddy.

**Jayapatāka:**
During the festival days for putting cooked food if there's big quantities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where?

**Jayapatāka:**
In these.

**Bhavānanda:**
A man who has joined us, he has given us the tempo[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
It is work...?

**Jayapatāka:**
It needs to be repaired.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, then don't take it. Don't take it. //Kānā goru brāhmaṇa ke dāna.//[?] You do not understand Bengali? "Blind cow given in charity to a //brāhmaṇa.//" When it is useless---"Charity. All right."

**Jayapatāka:**
If the man lives here, what to do? He's a devotee.

**Prabhupāda:**
You may go with your, this car, or throw it in the street. Don't take all these charities.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's that verse about the puffed rice when it blows away.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, "//Govindāya namaḥ.//" Purify, //govindāya namaḥ.// Don't take it. Simply immediately throw it in the street. It is obnoxious. Immediately break the whole thing and, part by part, sell it. But that is not possible. Ask him to first of all get it outside and then leave here. Don't allow this nonsense. [break] ...stand this space. Why? Why should we allow it? Useless.

**Jayapatāka:**
We were thinking about whether we should repair it or not.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. You should not take anything which requires repairing. Don't accept. [break] ...in the meantime. [break] Dirty. [Bengali] It has not worked for three hundred years. [Bengali] You do not engage them for cleansing?

**Bhavānanda:**
These boys are in charge.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that in charge? Why it is so dirty? Why it is so dirty?

**Devotee (3):**
We clean every day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Every day?

**Devotee (3):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why it is not clean today?

**Devotee (3):**
We clean it in the evenings before we leave. The people living upstairs, they pass through here. This is the entrance into their living quarters, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
You clean in the evening, and in the morning it is so dirty?

**Devotee (3):**
In the afternoon or in the evening, early.

**Prabhupāda:**
You clean in the evening and in the morning it is so dirty?

**Devotee (3):**
Well, they're passing through here to their living quarters.

**Prabhupāda:**
And therefore it should be dirty. Then what for cleaning? Just see. What is the cleaning? You clean in the evening; in the morning it is dirty. Is that very good reason? Clean. Engage them. [break] ...you are chanting, //śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nana-śrṅgara-tan-man..., tan-mandira-mārjanādau.// This is all temple. This is not ordinary hotel, free hotel. If they cannot take care as temple, they must go away. [break] ...eating, sleeping, that's all. Not working. See that they do not make it a free hotel for eating and sleeping. Don't allow this. It should be clean. Why in the evening? Every morning it should be clean and washed and mopped. [Bengali]

**Jayapatāka:**
Generally they chant the //japa// till about 7:15.

**Prabhupāda:**
And therefore everything should be... They must give up //japa;// first of all clean. That is //japa,// first. In the name of //japa// and dozing, and everything is unclean. This nonsense should not be allowed. Ask them, "Stop japping. First of all clean. Then //japa,// make //japa.//" This is a plea, "//japa.//"

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is a plea, excuse.

**Jayapatāka:**
Generally at 7:15 they start cleaning.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. I see. Why it is not clean? It must have been clean. [break] [Bengali] Yes, but I don't see they are working at the gate. [break] ...theoretical.

**Jayapatāka:**
They make every day the rice for the day.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where they are doing? Today is no rice required?

**Jayapatāka:**
They start when the schedule starts at 7:30.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the time now?

**Jayapatāka:**
They're all waiting for you to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Very punctual, 7:30. Not waiting.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They're chanting //japa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is japping? Please be careful that this idle class in the name of //japa...//

**Jayapatāka:**
There's no way here.

**Prabhupāda:**
So which way we shall go?

**Jayapatāka:**
Back on the road again. [break] Beet vegetable.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. [break] ...made. This is not washed? [Bengali with devotee] [break] This growth stopped?

**Jayapatāka:**
Here is the handloom production.

**Prabhupāda:**
What service they do?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What does that man do?

**Bhavānanda:**
He weeds all of the hedges under Tapomaya.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why they are drying? They should water it. [break] [Bengali] They are doing rightly. There are so many men. Why this should be not taken care of? [break] ...not indulge to give shelter persons---in the name of so-called //japa// they take advantage of free boarding and lodging. You should be very careful. Everyone should be, according to capacity, must be engaged to some work. Don't allow this stupidity. [break] ...plants are grown properly, you get so many fruits. They are drying. There is so much space. You can get the //śāk// and the fruit also. [break]

**Sudāmā:**
We made vegetable from that stem.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, it is very good vegetable. [break] ...and cycle.

**Bhavānanda:**
That is one of our boys from Italy. He is working in the //gośālā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That is not utilized.

**Local:**
