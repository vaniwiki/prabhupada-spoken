====== Morning Walk. Tour of Māyāpur Grounds ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...He'll change everything, all sinful activities.

**Jayapatāka:**
The devotees like when the loudspeakers are playing Hare Kṛṣṇa 'cause then the work [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...can hear any temple bells from the other temples during the //ārati.// I don't hear them having //ārati.// Do they? Maybe they don't have enough men there to ring the bells.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break]

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes. [break] ...went to Krishnanagar yesterday, and he's found bricks, so we can begin...

**Prabhupāda:**
Immediately.

**Jayapatāka:**
He can supply two and half //lakhs// of bricks within one month.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Jayapatāka:**
We should give the... We have two Life Members there. I've done this before, give the price for one //lakh// of bricks in advance and we get twenty rupees off. That way they'll give you the full supply. So in one month we can get all the bricks.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why they want advance?

**Jayapatāka:**
Because then you get the twenty rupees off.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Per thousand?

**Jayapatāka:**
They want advance because they have so many expenses for labors and things. They just started producing. It's helps them.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Twenty rupees per thousand?

**Jayapatāka:**
That means over two and a half thousand you save five thousand rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we have to advance two and a half thousand?

**Jayapatāka:**
No. We have to advance about thirty thousand.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
To save five thousand you have to advance thirty thousand.

**Jayapatāka:**
You get all the supply within one month.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Then they have no money. They want to manufacture with our money. Is that?

**Jayapatāka:**
Well, then they'll supply at the full price.

**Prabhupāda:**
But if they cannot supply, why shall I give advance? You take... You give us supply and take money. [break] ...take. Advance you take. Whatever he will be able to supply, say, within a week, you take one-fourth advance. Then take payment immediately as you supply. [break] ...of this?

**Bhavānanda:**
The... He works in the //gośālā,// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what he will do?

**Bhavānanda:**
He's going to get it out of here today.

**Jayapatāka:**
He... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
And engage it for Kṛṣṇa's service. If you are getting that for nothing, why not? [break] //...bhavan ke kana gulugar.//[?]

**Jayapatāka:**
Would you like to see the //gośālā// or the boat today, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Which side is boat?

**Jayapatāka:**
Straight.

**Prabhupāda:**
Straight?

**Bhavānanda:**
Boat is at Hulor Ghat.

**Prabhupāda:**
The boat is worth seeing. [laughter] [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
He's the only one who gives out fish //prasāda.// Even the rickshaw drivers don't take his //prasāda.// They say it is unclean. [indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Lady?

**Jayapatāka:**
In this house here. There's one lady lives here. One of the devotees was walking. He said she hears the //kīrtana// at night. One widow. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...bus came here.

**Bhavānanda:**
Down this road, turns here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. It goes to Krishnanagar.

**Sudāmā:**
This side, Śrīla Prabhupāda, down below, there is the kitchen for cooking. And we have here small //kuchula// for coal cooking.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Can you open one of these boards, show Prabhupāda the... [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
All is for storage.

**Sudāmā:**
Underneath. You have to open.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with devotee]

**Jayapatāka:**
They put all rice and everything there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Stock.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Books also?

**Sudāmā:**
Books. Mainly books.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Doesn't it get wet down there, though, Jayapatāka?

**Jayapatāka:**
There's another floor.

**Sudāmā:**
And also up front, behind Bhavānanda Mahārāja, is also another storage which goes all the way up to the front of the ship.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice.

**Sudāmā:**
These seats go folding down also when not in use. They can go up or down.

**Prabhupāda:**
It can go in the ocean?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It can go?

**Sudāmā:**
The //maji// who we purchased the boat from said it can go to Indonesia.

**Jayapatāka:**
No, he said... He went to Purī first.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is that //maji?//

**Jayapatāka:**
He went to Orissa.

**Sudāmā:**
He went to Orissa.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where is the //maji?// He went?

**Bhavānanda:**
It was another man in Diamond Harbour who said they would go to Indonesia. //Maji...// They have been to Purī.

**Jayapatāka:**
He went to Orissa.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Jayapatāka:**
His father owned the boat. We bought from him. His son was the //maji,// so we kept him as the //maji.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] Puri, Orissa, Cuttack. No? [Bengali with Indian man] So let us go. Which way? This way or that way? The same way.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Same way.

**Indian man:**
[Bengali]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We could go back on the bus...

**Jayapatāka:**
This will take about two, three more days to finish painting. Then it will be ready. The Deities will be going just here on one platform.

**Indian devotee:**
They are fixing water.

**Prabhupāda:**
And up?

**Jayapatāka:**
Up? People can also sit up. So it will be very nice to sit up on the top. We're making one special stair for all that. [break] ...cart. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...men you are going.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That boat?

**Jayapatāka:**
Twelve, fifteen men.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that can be easily accommodated?

**Jayapatāka:**
Oh, yes. We could accommodate even twenty men. But that will be easy to accommodate, just twelve.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Don't take many.

**Jayapatāka:**
You want to walk back the same way or a different way?

**Prabhupāda:**
Different? There is different way?

**Jayapatāka:**
There's one path this way. But that's longer.

**Prabhupāda:**
Longer. No... [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...should like to install the Deities for the program?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? If I am here, I can do. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//...kīrtana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This land belonged to Śrīdhara Mahārāja?

**Jayapatāka:**
It belonged to Śrīdhara Mahārāja. I think he sold it off. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...not doing anything.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No money, probably. [break] ...crane comes here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
For the big temple, big crane.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That will immediately silence them. Big crane rolling in that can be seen. The crane will be bigger than any other temple that's already built here. [break] ...engineer from Larson and Toubro who came to meet you in Bombay? He says that they've built one building now, the tallest building in India. It's a thirty-five-story building. It's over three hundred foot high.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Where is that? Bombay?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Air India building? Is that the one?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Maybe that's the one. What is the size of the Caitanya Maṭha? That's the biggest one here? The biggest in Bengal? The Caitanya Maṭha temple, a hundred and ten foot, is the biggest temple in Bengal. There's not many big temples here... But that church is bigger in Chowringhee. I think that church that the British built near...

**Prabhupāda:**
Chowringhee?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Near Victoria Memorial, that church?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. St. Paul's Cathedral.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think that's higher than...

**Madhudviṣa:**
Oh, yes. That's big.

**Bhavānanda:**
Also in Krishnanagar, big Catholic church.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with Indian] Five minutes. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...festival devotees will pay one rupee.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Such a short walk.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why? They should come by walking.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, unless someone is carrying something heavy or is invalid, they shouldn't ride.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They should pass that rule, you know, Jayapatāka? If they're told they can't, then they won't do it, if they're told they shouldn't. One reason might be that it becomes a little hot at that time of the year, so the heat of the day, maybe it's too much for them. Actually, there was a suggestion made by a number of GBC men that they wanted to request you that in future years that the festival could be held ending on Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's appearance day rather than beginning, the reason being that in America the months of...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is system here also. The festival begins before the birthday and ends on the birthday.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Their suggestion wanted to be that the entire festival, including Vṛndāvana and everything, should precede this, because in America beginning about mid-March, especially April, is the best months for preaching in colleges and other places.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So you can arrange like that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And furthermore, here it gets a little hot. This would give us the coolest months, February...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And February is the worst time for book distribution in the West, whereas March, April is a good time.

**Prabhupāda:**
So let them... So they may come in February.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In future years?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That will be very much appreciated by everyone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's not too cold in Vṛndāvana? I don't think so. End of February is not cold.

**Harikeṣa:**
For Westerners it's not cold.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, Westerners are accustomed to that. They'll like it. They'll prefer it. They won't mind. They can't take the heat. Vṛndāvana is very cold in mid-February, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not. Vṛndāvana is very cold December-January.

**Harikeṣa:**
At night. At night.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They are accustomed to it. They can tolerate it. The hot part is more intolerable for Americans. It's really a good idea.

**Harikeṣa:**
It's colder than sixty degrees.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The college preaching in the month of April is the very best. [break] Do you think something could be written on this wall?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Advertisement.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. This //prasādam// pavilion wall... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...be used for fuel. This crust, this, that can be used for burning. Yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
They are the fuel for the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] When dismantling will begin?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When will the dismantling begin?

**Prabhupāda:**
This gentleman, he will do that. He can do it immediately.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda said it can begin immediately. This man can do. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...are standing properly?

**Jayapatāka:**
Pardon?

**Prabhupāda:**
These walls, they are standing in right angle? This wall?

**Jayapatāka:**
I think so, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you have measured?

**Bhavānanda:**
Standing up properly on the boundary of the land, you mean?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Vertically.

**Jayapatāka:**
I saw the masons measuring when they bricked it, but I never measured myself.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What do you think might be wrong, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Then, in due course of time, it will fall down.

**Indian devotee (1):**
You mean the foundation?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, the wall, if it is like this.

**Bhavānanda:**
If it is leaning.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you have not tested it?

**Jayapatāka:**
I have seen while they were laying the bricks they were testing all the time.

**Harikeṣa:**
It seems to be leaning.

**Jayapatāka:**
In the future I'll personally...

**Madhudviṣa:**
Drop a plumb line.

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes, they have a...

**Madhudviṣa:**
You can drop a plumb line.

**Jayapatāka:**
From this corner we can see. [break] ...stores. You suggest //prasāda// from one of the stores.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Prasāda// selling.

**Jayapatāka:**
How is the best way to do that? Like in Jag... They are doing? A small...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
Like Jagannātha Purī?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, small basis, you can begin. All these rooms are being utilized?

**Jayapatāka:**
These are cement godown.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If this walk is lined with those bottle plums, as you suggested...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...it'll be very attractive.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Nellore, that house we were staying at had that.

**Prabhupāda:**
So bottle plums can be purchased?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why not do? [break] ...ing in their health?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. [//gurukula kīrtana// party, chanting, meets Prabhupāda] [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...like they are doing in so many other places?

**Prabhupāda:**
You spend it.

**Jayapatāka:**
Just like the Tirupati temple. They have got crores and crores of rupees in the bank, so government has borrowed twenty crores of rupees for improving the worship[?]. If we spend the money as soon as it's made, then they won't take.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's the point.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The reason the government...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is... That was the purpose of my Trust-making: fifty percent immediately spend for printing, fifty percent building---no money.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bank balance, zero.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is my program. You get money: you spend money.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Make one million and the next day be with nil.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Brahminical qualification. Whatever he gets, he spends. That's all.

**Jayapatāka:**
Those in ISKCON who haven't spent money, they got in trouble. Like in Germany they stored money.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, storing is not good. Some money may be, few //lakhs,// stored for emergency. Otherwise, the principle should be to get money and spend money.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually in Tirupati, one of the reasons the government took over is that the trustees themselves were squandering the money.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is everywhere.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Wrongfully, you know. That man who is our Life Member from Madras who was in charge of Indian Express? Girirāja and I made him a member.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Goenka?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Goenka. He was taking the money, and they caught him. He's one of the trustees, and he was embe..., you know, embezzling the money, using it for individual business projects he had. The government caught him. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[//kīrtana// playing on loudspeakers] ...from distant place.

**Indian man:**
[Bengali] ...in the villages? Otherwise we won't give them //prasādam.// [laughter] [Bengali]

**Jayapatāka:**
[indistinct] very popular. If we could distribute the Hare Kṛṣṇa records, they would play that over the loudspeaker.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. [break] Oh, //śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya.// [commenting on //kīrtana// over loudspeaker]

**Madhudviṣa:**
There was one question in class this morning about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, and in your //Bhāgavatam// you say that this is the smallest universe. So I questioned whether if this is the smallest universe, and Jayapatāka said that in other universes there's more volumes of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// would that mean that Kṛṣṇa manifests more pastimes in the higher universes?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He is unlimited. Why do you limit?

**Madhudviṣa:**
So is the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// compiled in the same way in other universes? Vyāsadeva compiles it like he does in this universe as well?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, same process.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Just it's more expanded.

**Prabhupāda:**
There are many demigods. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. Everything is //ananta.// Just like here you cannot count how many. Here, this much space, if I ask you, "Count how many grasses are there," you cannot do it. Everywhere. You count in this field how many plants are there. You cannot do it. So similarly other planet, other, other... There are unlimited fields. You cannot count. Why you try to count it, "How many universes? How many devotees? How many...?" That is foolishness. It is not possible. Wherever you start, everything is unlimited. Can you count how many atoms are there, atomic? That is your limitation. Therefore I say "frog philosophy." The limited wants to study the unlimited. That is frog philosophy. The frog is thinking, "Eh? Three feet. All right, four feet. All right, five feet." He cannot think unlimited, because he is frog. So don't imitate the frog. Take it as it is stated in the //śāstra.// Then it is all right. So what we are getting from this banana garden?

**Jayapatāka:**
Banana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Getting unlimited? [laughter] What do you do with the bananas?

**Jayapatāka:**
Offer them to the Deity. [indistinct] [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's better path here.

**Indian devotee:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Jayapatāka:**
See the mango?

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is that mango?

**Jayapatāka:**
It's about ten feet high.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's all. [break] How many years it will take?

**Jayapatāka:**
Take another two, three years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda? Sometime we read that Caitanya Mahāprabhu, in that... There is a mango tree that grew immediately? And it's described: no pit. No skin and no pit. Does that mean very thin skin or no skin at all? Because if there's no... I mean, it seems like for...

**Prabhupāda:**
Even it was skin, it was not the skin as you think.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Edible skin.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...with me in Kurukṣetra?

**Harikeṣa:**
I was there. Caitya-guru also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That Mr. Nanda, he showed his cowshed.

**Harikeṣa:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He has a cowshed?

**Harikeṣa:**
Yes. It's a big shed but no cows.

**Hari-śauri:**
Seventeen cows are here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [Bengali] What is this room?

**Jayapatāka:**
This is the... Right now the devotees are staying here. This will be a... It will come up to here. It will be one... There'll be storage and place for the milk and devotees here. Gradually we're building. We put a few thousand every month, whenever we get money for it---the //saṅkīrtana// parties.We're building this like the Gauḍīya Maṭha, just a little bit every month.

**Prabhupāda:**
These flowers, or where...?

**Jayapatāka:**
These are giving the milk. They eat the flowers.

**Prabhupāda:**
They eat?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, they like.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's nice.

**Jayapatāka:**
You can see them nicely from here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Sudāmā:**
This side.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Haribol.//

**Jayapatāka:**
This cow we just bought. What's the name? I don't know this one.

**Indian devotee (2):**
Lalitā.

**Jayapatāka:**
Lalitā. This is Surabhi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Lalitā Bose? [laughter]

**Jayapatāka:**
This is Surabhi, Surabhi cow.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is she giving milk?

**Jayapatāka:**
She is giving nice milk. She was from Hyderabad, that one. She gave... Baby one. This is Nandini. This is Kāmadhuk, the original cow. This is the first cow. Kaliya. The bull. We have to get a special room for him. He's too big now.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can make a, what is called, circular with fence.

**Sudāmā:**
Corral?

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you can get...

**Jayapatāka:**
He breaks it.

**Prabhupāda:**
He breaks?

**Jayapatāka:**
Because... He used to be baby. Now he's getting angry more. We'll make over there one fenced area, brick.

**Prabhupāda:**
So make //pakkā.//

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes. Otherwise sometimes he just picks up devotee and throws. Just last night he picked one devotee and threw him. Very dangerous now. He used to be quiet, but now he's getting old and ornery.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He threw the devotee?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hurt?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes, hurt. Hurt his leg.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then? How to control?

**Jayapatāka:**
We have to build him a special cage. Pīppalāi and others, they are able to control with stick and by nose. But inexperienced man, they just walk right next to him and then---//phttt!// You have to be careful when you go by him, so we have to put him separate...

**Prabhupāda:**
Separate. That is the way. That Hanuman Prasād in...?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hmm. Yes, I remember him.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, yes, so just suggest that way. Give him a plan.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is he going to get any bigger than that?

**Jayapatāka:**
I don't think so. He is half Australian and half Indian.

**Prabhupāda:**
Best half. [laughter] //Varṇa-saṅkara.//

**Jayapatāka:**
All of our cows are half and half, but the Western cows give the more milk.

**Prabhupāda:**
So they have no ground to graze?

**Jayapatāka:**
They go out every day and graze.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda, you want to see these?

**Jayapatāka:**
These are the bullocks on the left and the babies on the right. [devotees exclaim]

**Prabhupāda:**
They can be used for plowing?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes, when they get big. Some are cows and some are men, bulls. These are the new ones. In the government, they kill all the male calves and only keep the female. But we will use for the fields.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
This is for their little playpen.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Playpen?

**Jayapatāka:**
They eat...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Nicely made. Is this going to have a roof on it?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes, this roof we're just putting up.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I notice some of these cows are... Hariprasāda gave us.

**Madhudviṣa:**
They don't give milk?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. They've never given any milk. Very charitable. "Give it to Govinda."

**Jayapatāka:**
These three cows, we've been doing..., sent to the hospital two, three times. They've given all type of medicine, everything, but they just won't get pregnant. This one, two, three.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He knew it when he gave us these cows. He knew that.

**Jayapatāka:**
I was going to go to Hyderabad, but instead we started our building, so I sent Pūrna-prajña from Calcutta, my man. I sent two farmers. They called up and said, "They're giving bad cows. Don't take the cows." And then Haribhai Paduka got on the phone and said, "Oh, they are insulting me. They're saying I'm giving bad cows, this, that. I am going to..." He gave some complaint. So someone said, "All right. Whatever you give, it's all right." Then he gave these.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One good one and three useless ones.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why did you accept it?

**Jayapatāka:**
I was in Māyāpur. I told them, "Don't accept bad." They called up, said, "These are no good. We won't accept." Then from Calcutta someone said, "You accept."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These are the two oxen.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whenever somebody wants to give, you don't accept immediately. Tell them, "First of all let us see." [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...room for cutting the grass and for well. Pump room and grass-cutting room.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which way we shall go now?

**Sudāmā:**
This way, Prabhupāda.

**Jayapatāka:**
Previously the cows... Now, since before, the cows have become more healthy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayapatāka:**
Since before, cows have become more healthy, and now people are appreciating very much.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the cause?

**Jayapatāka:**
The cost?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The cause for the...

**Jayapatāka:**
Oh, because of Pīppalāi's very careful service.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who is Pīppalāi?

**Jayapatāka:**
This is Pīppalāi Prabhu, here. He is from Mexico.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got experience?

**Pīppalāi:**
No, I don't have experience.

**Hari-śauri:**
He was running the presses in New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you like this?

**Pīppalāi:**
Yes, very much so.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Jayapatāka:**
And also John Prabhu... Both of them, they are staying here even there's no electricity.

**Prabhupāda:**
Electricity is not very important thing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Which way, Jayapatāka?

**Prabhupāda:**
So?

**Jayapatāka:**
They wanted to show their land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where it is? So? What that land will be utilized for?

**Jayapatāka:**
That's only good for cultivation.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got sufficient arrangement for cultivation?

**Jayapatāka:**
We need... We don't have enough cultivation land for the amount of devotees we have.

**Prabhupāda:**
So how many //bīghās// there are?

**Jayapatāka:**
But that land...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Where is it?

**Jayapatāka:**
Even from here you can just see without going all that way there. The thing... This is the lake.

**Prabhupāda:**
Lake?

**Jayapatāka:**
This is a lake. This, in the rainy season it becomes submerged. That's what I was saying last night. He said that if you dig a lake in the middle, then you can make it high.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Useless land.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not good.

**Jayapatāka:**
But now we've got some crops growing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That means that land should be very cheap.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He can sell very cheaply. It's very low land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now you should have sufficient experience. People may not cheat you---low land, high price.

**Jayapatāka:**
I understand. I know those things. That's why... But he was just forcing his way in your room and then saying all those things. That's why when he came I said, "How many crops you took from your land?" I know all the history of these lands.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] You cannot utilize it for different crops. Only one you can.

**Jayapatāka:**
You can only use for, in the rainy season, for some type of rice, and then now wheat---two crops.

**Indian man (3):**
[Bengali]

**Jayapatāka:**
Winter rice, he is saying, //bula[?]// rice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [Bengali with Indian man] Now, taking instruction from Mādhava Mahārāja, you should be careful about purchasing land. People are very cunning. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...plus that ten //bīghās// and eight //bīghās// of land on the corner, you were mentioning?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes. We will go back this way. Will Prabhupāda be able to walk that far?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't know how far it is.

**Jayapatāka:**
It's right over there. Of course, we can go back through the field. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...can see tomorrow. Eh?

**Jayapatāka:**
All right. We'll check it, make a path. See, that's the path. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The road is rough.

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we shall go that way. If it is like this, we can go. Now, still, it is rough. [Bengali with Indian devotee] [break] ...filling up the road? No. You have taken earth from here.

**Indian devotee:**
[Bengali]

**Jayapatāka:**
They're just leveling. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...whether they are being properly utilized.

**Jayapatāka:**
Every land is being planted on. We made...

**Prabhupāda:**
On the other side you have got some land?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes. We plan to put irrigation there. I have two diesel five-horsepower, seven-horsepower engine. One I put over there, and they are irrigating. We have fourteen //bīghās// of wheat, very good wheat. And here in the back we've also purchased this year another set, and we're irrigating that. This unirrigated land, and it only gets some chickpea and things, very bad crop, minimum crop. So now we've got the irrigation, we're getting many more crops. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
That I want, that it must be properly utilized. Otherwise you purchase and there is no utility.

**Jayapatāka:**
But Tapomaya, he says that we need more land to be able to feed all the devotees. And every time we're building more buildings, we're just losing land but we're not gaining so much agricultural land.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. We can purchase. First of all think that whether we can utilize.

**Jayapatāka:**
Land is all being utilized. We need more land for grazing the cows also.

**Bhavānanda:**
Definitely the land can be utilized.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Then purchase.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, I had one question about this play by Girish Ghosh. The Girish Ghosh was a debauchee, and wouldn't it be better to take..., make dramas from your //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?// Then the sound vibration is coming from pure source. Or does that not matter? If the man was...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. First of all you see how it can be utilized, whatever translation is there. Then we shall purify it. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlānam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. Just like this microphone: it is prepared by the meat-eaters. How we are utilizing it? Everything has got a proper process to purify it. [break] ...nice, huh?

**Jayapatāka:**
We don't have any land in this area.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Whose land is it?

**Jayapatāka:**
So many people.

**Prabhupāda:**
So many.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's not being used?

**Jayapatāka:**
Chickpeas.

**Prabhupāda:**
So it is good land? No.

**Jayapatāka:**
This is medium land. Across the road is considered good land. Our area here is considered good because of irrigation. This is medium. [break] And the man wants to sell. But it doesn't go as far as our land. It only goes to this point. He's asking three thousand.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are all expecting good price from us.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Before we came here...

**Jayapatāka:**
Only in the back, still they are asking more reasonable: seventeen, sixteen, eighteen, four thousand.

**Prabhupāda:**
Seventeen, sixteen?

**Jayapatāka:**
They're asking in the back.

**Prabhupāda:**
Seventeen hundred? That's all right.

**Jayapatāka:**
We're buying those. So why they put the water here? To sabotage. There was no water when we came. Now they put more water here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who did it?

**Jayapatāka:**
Gosvāmī Mahārāja is taking water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayapatāka:**
They flooded.

**Sudāmā:**
You cross here, Prabhupāda. [break] [end]
