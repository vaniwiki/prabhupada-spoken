**Prabhupāda:**
...Viśvanātha Cakravartī has discussed. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so easy: //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto,// four principles. Why people do not take to it? [background talking] Hmm? What is that?

**Harikeśa:**
He just wanted to know if someone was allowed to come for //darśana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, let them come. This time, five to seven? [conchshell sounds]

**Indian guest:**
[Bengali] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śrīmad-bhāgavata-dharma// is for the person who is not jealous. //Paramo nirmatśarāṇāṁ// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. This very word is used in the beginning, that "This //bhāgavata-dharma// is meant for persons who is not jealous." Otherwise the material whole world is full of jealousy. Even during the time of Kṛṣṇa there was Paundra, out of jealousy. And there were so many. Beginning from Kṛṣṇa's birth the //asuras,// they were jealous: "How to kill Kṛṣṇa." This is the whole mat... Even in the higher planetary system the jealousy is there, //asuras// and the //devas, devāsura.// So our business is, as instructed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā.// This jealousy will go on. Therefore one has to learn how to tolerate jealousy. //Kīrtaniyaḥ sadā hariḥ// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]. If one wants to push on this //saṅkīrtana// movement... Prabhupāda... We are insignificant creature. So many persons. You cannot avoid it. The best way is to learn how to tolerate. That is very nice. Otherwise Caitanya Mahāprabhu not have said //taror api sahiṣṇunā.// That is the best. So we are not like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, neither like Prabhupāda, and we shall have to learn to tolerate. [Bengali with guest] It is clearly written in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// that //kṛṣṇa śakti vinā nāhe kṛṣṇa nāma pracāraṇa// [[books:cc:antya:7:11|[Cc. Antya 7.11]]]. So even they have no common sense, what can be done?

**Indian guest:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, this formula, that this is something new in the history of the world, and still they are jealous, what is this? They are finding fault. In Vṛndāvana, Nṛsiṁha-vallabha Gosvāmī, you know? He comes to me. He says, "So many people are jealous upon you." I say that "First of all you create something like me; then you become jealous." [Bengali with guests] First of all let them become like me. Then... [Bengali with guests] The superior, he will dictate. And //yei,// equal, they will live like friends. And those who are junior, they should follow and obey. This is the Vaiṣṇava //niyama.// So those who are neither equal nor higher, how they can dictate? That is their mistake. Either first of all become higher than him---then you dictate---or you be equal with him---then you suggest. You are lower and you want to dictate? What is this nonsense? [Bengali] By standard, one who is lower, they want to dictate.

**Indian guest:**
[Bengali] [loud conchshell] //Bās.// [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Indian guest:**
[Bengali] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They may be very big visioner. [Bengali] //Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]. A //pakkā// Vaiṣṇava like you, to find out faults, what is this? Rādhārāṇī is... [Bengali] They have not united; they have disunited. And here, practically you see all religions, all nations, all persons, all philosophy. Everything is there. [Bengali] They have come with their life. [Bengali with guest] //Bole// CIA... [Bengali] Less common sense they have. They haven't got even common sense.

**Indian guest:**
[Bengali] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, so all the money should be given to us. The money actually belongs to Kṛṣṇa. You, by tricks, you are holding it. [knock] Yes? //Āsana.// [Bengali] Open this. Open. [Bengali] [break] [end]
