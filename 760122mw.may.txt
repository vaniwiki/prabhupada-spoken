**Prabhupāda:**
//Viṣaya...// [Bengali] This sense gratification, that is available everywhere. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Śāstrījī:**
[chanting Sanskrit or Bengali //ślokas//] [break] //Āise guru-pada-kamalaṁ vande. Āise guru-pada-kamalaṁ vande.// [chants Bengali verses] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...sex. //Āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithuna.// This is life: sex and //bhaya,// fearfulness, and then eating and sleeping---four things. They must eat, they must sleep, and the sex, and as soon as some men are coming, flying. This is there in the human society. Where is the distinction?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No distinction.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are also together, the same---sex. //Āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithuna.// And they are writing books, big, big book, "Sex Psychology," Freud. This rascals' philosophy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What's-his-name is doing that too. That bogus //guru// in Bombay, Rajneesh. He is also writing sex psychology books.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. And this is going on as pleasure.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhagavan Rajneesh.

**Guḍākeśa:**
He's been thrown out of Bombay now. He can't come to Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
So many rascals are there. Is there any philosophy which is existent in the lower animals? What is philosophy there? And they are writing big, big philosophy---Freud's philosophy and others.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You were describing that Freud's business is that he had sex life with his mother.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You did not know that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, I didn't know it till you...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You told me?

**Harikeśa:**
No, you told me. Then I told you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Somebody told me, some Western authority.

**Hari-śauri:**
[laughs] It must have been Harikeśa.

**Prabhupāda:**
The Muhammadans say... In the Koran it is written there, "From this day, no sex life with mother." In the modern philosophy they say, "What is the wrong? Why there should be discrimination?" John Lennon was follower of this. "Sex anyone. It doesn't matter. It is a bodily necessity, that's all." They learn this art from the hogs, hog philosophy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There is one popular music group in America called the Hog Farm. And what they do is they have their... When they are playing their music, just below the stage they have a big pen with many hogs in it, and at the end of the music they all jump down amongst the hogs, and then they do all kinds of nonsense things. And it's a very popular group.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] How they are bringing ruination. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. Blind men led by another blind man. It is not new. In the //Bhāgavata// therefore it is warned that "Don't follow hog philosophy." //Viḍ-bhujāṁ ye.// This kind of philosophy, that for sense gratification, laboring whole day and night, writing books, philosophizing and all these things, it is meant for the hogs, not for human being. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. This kind of civilization is meant for the hogs. So they are exhibiting that they are no better than hog.

**Śāstrījī:**
//Śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Brahma-saukhya, ananta-brahma-saukhya.// [break] [sings Bengali verses]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with Śāstrījī, criticizing verses] Don't manufacture knowledge. Take knowledge from Bhagavān. And that is our business. [Bengali with Śāstrījī] Don't order Bhagavān. Just follow Bhagavān. That is wanted. [Bengali with Śāstrījī] Don't write concocted poetries. That is not beneficial. Simply follow. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. That is your business, not to give //upadeśa// to Kṛṣṇa: "Kṛṣṇa, do this." //Nāciye nāciye āile gopāla:// "My dear Gopāla, please come to me, //nāciye,// dancing." And the Gopāla is father's servant. Ordering, "Gopāla, come," //nāciye nāciye,// "for my sense gratification." It is all nonsense. Why should you ask Gopāla to come to you? [Bengali] You cannot order. You must follow. [Bengali with Śāstrījī] ...to carry out the order of God, not to order God to carry out my order. That is mistake.

**Indian man (1):**
Always surrender to God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (1):**
Move according to the dictation of God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Don't dictate God. The demigod worshipers, they dictate, //dhanaṁ dehi, rūpaṁ dehi, yaśo de...// This //dehi, dehi, dehi.// Therefore they are condemned. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// they have been condemned. //Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]. He is so //kāmuka,// he is ordering God. //Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ.// But that order cannot be carried by God, but the demigods, they sometimes become flattered and give this benediction. So Kṛṣṇa said, //tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām:// "This kind of flattering the demigods and take some benediction," //antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. Order... You cannot order God, but you can flatter these demigods. And therefore people are very much fond of flattering these demigods because...

**Indian man (1):**
Just to get material wealth. Material happiness.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's it. //Tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣām.// All this material happiness, you may get it, but it will be finished with your body.

**Indian man (1):**
It is transcient.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa says that //teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, dadāmi buddhi-yoga// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. He says, "I will give intelligence. There is no question of asking. If you become a devotee, sincere devotee, I'll give you everything without your asking." You understand, follow?

**Śāstrījī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you qualify yourself. That is wanted. That qualification is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He is always prepared to give you light. Just like sunlight is open always, but if you keep yourself in the dark room, how you can take benefit of the sunlight? Your business is to come before the sun; then everything will be all right. [break] ...used to sing like that, //sab ke sumati de bhagavān.//[?] Huh? //Raghupati rāghava rāja...// You know? //Sab ke sumati de bhagavān. De bhagavān?// What is this nonsense? He's asking, //de bhagavān.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What does that mean, "//de bhagavān//"?

**Guḍākeśa:**
"Give me."

**Prabhupāda:**
Give him. //Sab ke sumati de bhagavān.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's for the demigods.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he has no sense what is God. This is going on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Isn't it that song they sing at the Kumbha-melā? You know, they were singing all the time at the Kumbha-melā, "Give me this, give me that." What is that song?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, the //ārati, ārati.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That //ārati// song. //Oṁ jaya jagadīśa?//

**Indian man (1):**
//Hare.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Viṣaya paiye, dhana sampati paiye.// What is that? [laughter] //Jaya bhagavān. Dehom ki viṣaya//[?], //jaya bhagavān.//

**Indian man (2):**
//Sab ko sampati de bhagavān.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Duḥkha jaye sampati paiye de bhagavān, jayo kara.// [Bengali] Whole world, they have accepted God as order-supplier: "I order, and You supply." They all, this Christian Church also: "God, give us our daily bread."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And if God doesn't give, then God is dead.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dead.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Atheist.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is going on. And our prayer is, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]: "I don't want anything. Simply engage me in Your service." //Mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī.// This is real prayer, which is taught by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda? I was reading in a magazine that in Germany the people used to be pious, but after the Second World War...

**Prabhupāda:**
They became atheist.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Completely atheists.

**Guḍākeśa:**
Prabhupāda said that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Because they all said, "If God is there, then..."

**Prabhupāda:**
That... It was spoken by my, that Godbrother, Sadānanda. He told me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That could be the possibility why the government is harassing us there so much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. Not only... Everywhere now there will be harassment for us, because this is the only movement preaching about God's glories. This is only movement in the whole world. So the harassment will increase.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Increase.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The more we sell our books, the harassment will be there. But sale is increasing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right. And we just double our effort.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] ...throughout the whole world. [Bengali] ...religious persecution. We don't mind that. We shall go on with our business. [Bengali] They feel, "Now this is coming."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Threat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They know we're threatening.

**Prabhupāda:**
When they feel. Yes. Just like our Godbrothers. [laughs] Now they're feeling; therefore there is harassment: "Harass them." Planning how to harass. Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu. When he saw that Prahlāda could not be killed in so many ways, he became very much disturbed: "What is this?" Then one day he asked, "Prahlāda, wherefrom you have got this power?" "No, wherefrom you have got this power? I am getting from the same source."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He didn't like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Again he became angry: "Somebody else than me? I am God."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"I am world preacher."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...is so kind that He is sitting in everyone's heart to give him good advice. There is no need of asking. He is only finding out the good opportunity to speak to him. [Bengali] Two birds sitting? So He is always eager to give you advice. He comes down to give you advice. So we are not taking His advice. That is the position.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Sarvasya cāham...//

**Indian man (2):**
//...hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ,// He said. So who is taking His advice? Five thousand years Kṛṣṇa said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Who is surrendering? Hmm? Therefore Kṛṣṇa came again as Caitanya Mahāprabhu---how to surrender---but still the rascals will not do that.

**Indian man (2):**
//Ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jīvasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This is illusion. [break] ...two cases. One was my friend, and he was a big man. So one servant, he advised him that "You do like this." He was immediately dismissed. I have got experience. "You are trying to advise me? Get out immediately." Huh?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very good example. So if we try to advise God...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, God is not so foolish that... But He laughs, that "This man has come to advise."

**Indian man (1):**
God is //sarva-jña.//

**Prabhupāda:**
My Guru Mahārāja used to say---I think I have explained many times---that "Don't try to see God. Do in such a way that God will see you." Similarly, don't try to advise God, but follow the advice of God. That is our way. Because Bhagavān... [Bengali] This is also command. [Bengali] //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.// If you are fully engaged in the service, then He will come: "Please see Me." //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [Brs. 1.2.234]. And if we want to see God with our these blunt eyes, it is not possible. //Na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ.// This said. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. [Bengali] Or in the material world if our mind is always disturbed for sense gratification, it is not possible. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi.// Even you cannot understand what is this chanting, //śrī-kṛṣṇa...// Because God worship begins from the chanting of name, therefore it is said, //ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi. Nāma, līlā,// form. Begins from //nāma.// So //na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ.// If you keep your senses blunt, then it is not possible. Purify. And what is that? //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Hṛṣīka// means senses. When you engage all your senses in the service of the Lord, then you become //nirmala. Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate. Tat-paratvena nirmalam.//

> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

[Bengali] //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "As soon as you surrender, I take charge of you." Then? Everything you'll get. Be always confident that "Kṛṣṇa will save me. Let me serve Kṛṣṇa sincerely." That's all. [Bengali with Śāstrījī] They become //dhīra.// [Bengali] You'll find in //Bhagavad-gītā,// Arjuna many times said, //iti śuśrūṣu:// "I do not know whether it is correct, but I heard it like that." That is speeching, speaking. What you have heard from the authorities, if you speak, you repeat that, that is real speaking. Then //pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt:// then you'll be //guru// for the whole world, if you don't manufacture. So what is the difference between our Kṛṣṇa conscious and others? They manufactured ideas. Just like Ramakrishna Mission manufactured: //daridra-nārāyaṇa sevā.// Where is...? Nārāyaṇa is there, Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. Where is this word, //daridra-nārāyaṇa?// He manufactured. Is he a successful... [Bengali about Vivekananda and Ramakrishna]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We never heard of him in America.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Indian man:**
[indistinct about roads in Calcutta named after Vivekananda]

**Jayapatākā:**
They are saying that there, there are so many roads named after him. They are saying.

**Prabhupāda:**
How propaganda, lies.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We never even heard of him.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have seen one road, street, Gandhi's, Mexico, and there is no other. Mexico, when there was trouble with the Americans, they adopted Gandhi's noncooperation movement. Therefore they regarded Gandhi. There is Gandhi's statue and Gandhi's name, one. Who had been Mexico, any of you? That I have seen. And I never seen Vivekananda Road. Never. Or India---oh, so many, this, that. No Caitanya Mahāprabhu Road. Vivekananda Road. Propaganda. The other day I saw some stamp, postage, "Vivekananda." You have seen it? But never they will publish Kṛṣṇa or Caitanya Mahāprabhu. "Kṛṣṇa is fictitious." What is called? Mythology. "Kṛṣṇa is mythology." [Bengali with Indians] The government saw, especially the police department, and they became so popular. Within two, three years, thousands and thousands of men, not only Indian. //Kichu āchen.// All Europeans, American, Englishmen, they are following Rathayātrā. //Sei jagannātha, sei hare kṛṣṇa.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In San Francisco they made it a holiday.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali about London] "Rival of Nelson Column..." [Bengali] they wrote. [break] [Bengali] "It is hell." Actually that is. Always wet. No road you'll find it is dry. Always damp. Is it not?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, hellish.

**Prabhupāda:**
And it is so damp that in the trees you will see..., what is called? [Bengali] Moss, moss, moss. Yes.

**Indian man (1):**
Gathered moss.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In every tree you will find. They do not get sufficient sunshine. [Bengali] We have got very nice lawn, but I cannot enjoy it. Hardly one day or two.

**Indian man (1):**
Always wet.

**Prabhupāda:**
You cannot sit there. It is cold.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Cold and damp. It's about five after seven now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] [end]
