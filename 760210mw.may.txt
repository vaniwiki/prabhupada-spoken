**Prabhupāda:**
What is this meaning?

**Hari-śauri:**
They say that's just a figure of speech.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Hari-śauri:**
A figure of speech. Not meant to be literal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything is theory. No practical. [break] ...ten direction. Eight direction, corner, and north-east, east-west, and up and down. So everywhere He is present. So Kṛṣṇa has got ten hands. So my father used to say, "If when Kṛṣṇa takes your money or possession in ten hands, how you can protect it with two hands? And when He give you in ten hands, how much you can take in two hands?" [laughs] So in my case it has become practical. Everything He has taken in ten hands, and now He is giving in ten hands. [laughter] I am practically experiencing. My Guru Mahārāja ordered me, "You do this." I was trying to save my business, my family, with two hands, and Kṛṣṇa took it in ten hands. [laughs] And now, after making me beggar, He is giving me, ten hands: "You take as much as you like." Now I am thinking of my father's instruction. [break] ...ambition was that I become a great devo..., //bhāgavata.// That was his... He used to invite so many saintly persons, and he would pray, "Please bless my son"---I was very pet son---"that he may become a devotee of Rādhārāṇī. Rādhārāṇī may bless him." That was his only prayer.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Fulfilled.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He was inviting so many saintly persons. That is the old system, to receive saintly person.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that you were not so much impressed by the saintly persons that were coming.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Why was that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not all of them were real Vaiṣṇava. That was my discrimination from the beginning of my life. I never liked these bogus //svāmīs// and //yogīs.// I never liked. But my father had no discrimination: "Never mind whatever he is. He is a saintly person. Receive him." He was giving fortnightly... There was one Māyāvādī //sannyāsī// in Kālīghāṭa. So first of all the father was //sannyāsī,// then his son was //sannyāsī.// So we had very good relationship with him. I also used to... Because father was going. So he would carry //gāñjā// for him---in those days //gāñjā// was very cheap---so much //gāñjā// and so much butter. Whenever he would visit, he'd give some red cloth, //gāñjā// and butter.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Your father would give him //gāñjā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
That, to //sannyāsī.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Why?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, he was smoking //gāñjā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But why did he supply him?

**Prabhupāda:**
He did not discriminate that "This is bad." He smokes, and he had some regard for him. "All right, take //gāñjā.//" [laughter]

**Hṛdayānanda:**
So Kṛṣṇa is also like that if we...

**Prabhupāda:**
He was offering him something, "Whatever he likes." That was his theory.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Friendly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "It doesn't matter." He did not know the //gāñjā// smoking was bad for //sādhu.// That is impression in India. We criticize, but in India, in every //sādhu samāj// they smoke //gāñjā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Still?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Not high class. These bogus //svāmīs// and //yogīs,// they...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, that Mr. Das, the lawyer who came here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I used to visit him, and he had one //sādhu// who used to come who was his //guru,// and he would also smoke //gāñjā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Gāñjā// smoking is not taken as bad in India---by the //sādhus,// not ordinary men.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right. He told me, Mr. Das, that it increased his meditation and ecstasy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever it may be, //gāñjā// smoking by the //sādhus, sannyāsīs,// is not taken very bad, serious. The hippies learned from them.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Allen Ginsberg introduced. "Yes. //Gāñjā// smoking is very good by the saintly person."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think your Guru Mahārāja spoke strongly against such persons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. And from him we learned that intoxication, any kind of intoxication, is bad.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura also was...

**Prabhupāda:**
He was also not very serious, but Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was very serious, and we learned from him. No, it is //śāstriya.// No intoxication is good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How is it that Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was not so strict in that regard, yet his son, who learned from him, became very strict, like a rod?

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was so strict [laughs] that because he married twice, he used to say, "//Strī-saṅgī,// attached to woman," even his father. [laughter] He was very strict. Sometimes when he would be angry, he'd, "You //strī-saṅgī.//" And don't discuss this thing. [laughs] He was very strict. No excuse, no compromise.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's where you got all of that from.

**Prabhupāda:**
My is imitation, but his was real. [laughs] All these Navadvīpa people were afraid of him.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Afraid.

**Prabhupāda:**
Strong-hearted. They made a, what is called, conspiracy to kill him.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Who did this?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, the Navadvīpa //gosvāmīs.// They raised 25,000 rupees and wanted to bribe this police officer that "You take this money. We shall finish him. Don't take any action."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But the policeman said...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Refused. "Yes, we take bribe, but not in such cases."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Why?

**Prabhupāda:**
"He's a saintly person. We cannot agree to that." Everyone knows police takes bribe. They admit, "Yes, we take bribe, but not in such cases." This was told by Guru Mahārāja, Bhaktisi..., to me. He was talking many things confidential.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, but what is that story that one time Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī was invited to... He wanted to get invitation or he was invited to speak, and they put so many conditions on his speaking. It was some place.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They said, "Now you cannot speak on such and such subject." He agreed, "All right."

**Prabhupāda:**
I think there was a Vaiṣṇava meeting inaugurated by Mahārāja Maṇīndrānandī. You are referring to that. [break] When I was visiting, I used to sit on his couch. Yes, like... Guru Mahārāja was sitting on the couch, so I took him as ordinary gentleman. So then nobody asked me that, that "You are sitting? Get down." No. Nobody asked me. Then I was seeing that all other big, big disciples, they are sitting down. So then I began to sit down. Neither Guru Mahārāja told me, neither anybody told me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What kind of a... It was a regular couch...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...or a //cauki?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Not //cauki;// couch. That padded couch, bench.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Sofa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sofa, sofa, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, boy. You were a young man at that time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But no one said anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not very young. It was in 19... Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
1923?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. '23, of course, when I first met him, he was sitting, ground. I was also. At Mathurā there was party, //parikramā// party, in 1933. So I went to see that party, what they are doing, Gauḍīya Maṭha, out of inquisitiveness.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It was at that time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You mentioned once that most of the //parikramā// devotees, they wanted to go on //parikramā,// but he was speaking?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So I did not go to //parikramā,// so he very much appreciated. There was announcement that "Now //parikramā// will start in the evening at five, and Prabhupāda also will speak. So anyone who wants to hear Prabhupāda, he can stay. Others be ready for going." So about a dozen men remained, and all went to //parikramā.// So I was at that time new man---not exactly new man, but not recognized disciple. I did not go. So he saw that I am sitting, I did not go to //parikramā.// He very much appreciated. I preferred to hear him than go to //parikramā.// That he appreciated.

**Hari-śauri:**
That was the same time that you took initiation?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. After that, I took initiation.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Where was the initiation ceremony?

**Prabhupāda:**
That Allahabad.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Allahabad.

**Prabhupāda:**
1933.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So from Mathurā everyone went to Allahabad?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, or they went to somewhere. But I came back. From Allahabad I went to Mathurā, and I came back to Allahabad at my own place.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Initiation was held at that Gauḍīya Maṭha in Allahabad?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah. At that time that Gauḍīya Maṭha also not there. That is at a rented house.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Did you help to build that one?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Did you help to establish that Gauḍīya Maṭha? Of that was after?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, majority was paid by one of my Godbrothers, that three thousand, purchasing land. Then gradually developed. We used to pay something. [break] ...before to here?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yeah. He has come many times, Tarun Babu.

**Prabhupāda:**
He came many times? [end]
