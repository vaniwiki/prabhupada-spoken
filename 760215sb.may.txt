Translation: "Prahlāda Mahārāja continued to offer his prayer as follows: How is it possible to offer suitable prayers unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead by me, who is born into the family of asuras, because all the demigods and saintly persons could not satisfy Him till now, although such persons are exalted, very qualified, in the mode of goodness. Then what to speak of me? I am not at all qualified."

**Prabhupāda:**

> prahrāda uvāca

//Ugra-jā. Ugra-jā,// just like in Europe and America we see, they are very much fond of //ugra-karma,// just like big, big factories, big, big bridges, wonderful. Long, long ago when the Britishers came here, they constructed big, big bridges, railway line. People thought, "It is wonderful." There is a song composed in Bihar. So when the Calcutta, the floating bridge made of wood, wooden bridge, floating bridge was constructed, connected Calcutta proper and Howrah, so there was big, wonderful song: //ki apana banaylay sahat campani.// There is song, //ki apana banaylay sahat campani upara me ami cale,// and..., just like that, //nīche me pāni//[?].

So this //ugra-karma,// formerly this //ugra-karma// was entrusted to the demons. Those who were in the //sattva-guṇa,// they do not like this //ugra-karma. Sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa. Rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. The... Those who are under the control of //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// they are engaged in //ugra-karma. Ugra-karma,// industrial enterprise: big, big roads, big, big skyscraper. This is called //ugra-karma.// So //ugra-karma// is very pleasing to the //ugra-jātis,// just like Hiraṇyakaśipu. What was the trouble between the father and the son? The father was for //ugra-karma,// and the son, Prahlāda, was for //sattvika// life. So when Prahlāda Mahārāja engaged himself in //sattvika// life... Not only //sattvika, śuddha-sattvika.// In the material world there are three //guṇas: sattvika, rājasika, tāmasika.// The //sattvika// is the best. So... And devotional activity is //śuddha-sattvika,// where there is no contamination. In the material world, //sattvika,// a person who is a //brāhmaṇa,// he may be contaminated by //tamo-guṇa// and //rajo-guṇa.// Just like Ajāmila: he was the son of a //brāhmaṇa,// and he was executing the //brahmacarya// regulation very nicely, but he became infected with //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// became attached to a prostitute and left everything, all brahminical qualification, and he became a rogue, thief, cheater, drunkard, woman-hunter, so on. There are many instances. And Jagāi-Mādhāi, they were born of very good //brāhmaṇa// family, rich family, but with bad association they became drunkard, woman-hunter, meat-eater.

Now these things have become common thing. //Avaidha-strī-saṅga,// illicit connection with woman, and meat-eating and drinking, it has become a daily fashion. But formerly, at least five hundred years ago, these things were accepted as most abominable. So just like here, our Jagāi-Mādhāi. Jagāi-Mādhāi, they were zamindars and born of //brāhmaṇa// family, but because by bad association they became drunkard, gamblers and woman-hunters, they were condemned. They were taken as //pāpī,// sinful. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement is to rescue them. That is the song by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura: //vrajendra-nandana yei, śacī-suta hoilo sei, balarāma hoilo nitāi, pāpī tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo, tare sākṣī jagāi// and //mādhāi.// Everyone wants evidence that how Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered //pāpī tāpī.// Now, here is the instance: //tāre sākṣī jagāi// and //mādhāi.// So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so nice that it can deliver the Jagāi and Mādhāi, //ugra-karma.// That is the mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He began this. //Pāpī tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo.// Now this same flow is going on in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So //ugra-karma.//

So Prahlāda Mahārāja is considering himself born of a father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, as //ugra-karma.// So he's saying, //harir ugra-jāteḥ,// that the... //Brahmādayaḥ sura-gaṇa,// "Lord Brahmā and other demigods, they are coming from the higher planetary system, and they are in the //sattvika guṇa, sattva-guṇa.// They are not ordinary person." Just like coming from some pious pilgrimage, he's supposed to be very nice man, similarly, //brahmādayaḥ,// they are coming from //svarga-loka.// Why //svarga-loka// is better than this //loka?// The thing is, in the //svarga-loka,// although they are attached to material enjoyment, still, they are great devotees. Therefore //svarga-loka// is praised. They are not like us. Here, those who are attached to material prosperity, they forget Kṛṣṇa, or God.

> bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ
> tayāpahṛta-cetasām
> vyavasāyātmikā-buddhiḥ
> samādhau nādhigacchati
> [[books:bg:2:44|[Bg. 2.44]]]

Those who are too much attached for material enjoyment, they do not become attracted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is natural. So anyway, Prahlāda Mahārāja was doubting, because he was requested by Lord Brahmā, "My dear boy, my dear child, we could not pacify His Lordship Nṛsiṁha-deva, but He has appeared for you." //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. "Nṛsiṁha-deva, this wonderful form, is there only for you." //Paritrāṇāya.// "You are //sādhu.// For your deliverance Nṛsiṁha-deva has appeared, and to kill your sinful father. So business is with your father and yourself. So kindly you take care of the business. He is very, very angry."

So before that, we have already described, even Lakṣmījī, he could not go forward. Although she had daily affairs with Nārāyaṇa, she could not dare to go forward. Brahmā, Lord Brahmā, offered their prayers; other, Lord Śiva, offered their prayers; but nobody could pacify Him. Therefore he is in doubt, that "I am born in the family of demons," //ugra-karma, ugra-jāti.// "If Brahmā failed, Lakṣmījī failed, Lord Śiva failed to pacify Him, how it is possible by me to pacify the Lord?" That he's doubting. //Brahmādayaḥ sura-gaṇā-munayo 'tha siddhāḥ:// "All they are exalted persons and //siddha.//" There is a Siddhaloka. In the higher planetary system there is a planet known as Siddhaloka. If there is opportunity, as we are contemplating, we shall show here in Caitanya-candra..., er, Māyāpur-candrodaya temple. That is our plan, to make a very big temple and to show all the planetary system within that from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// It will not be an ordinary temple, so that people from the whole world, they will come. This is our contemplation. There is a Siddhaloka. We shall show how this planet works, Siddhaloka. From the Siddhaloka the persons who came there, they are called //siddhyā, siddhyā.// And in the, on the heavenly planet they are called demigods, //devatā.// Similarly, Siddhaloka... The description of the Siddhaloka is there in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Those who have read, they know. The Siddhaloka person, they can go from one planet to another without any machine, aeroplane, Siddhaloka. They can go from one planet to another. This is described. They don't require any machines. Still, like the //yogīs,// those who are perfect //yogīs,// they can go from one place to another without any vehicle. There are many //yogīs// still existing, they take bathing in four //dhāmas:// in Hardwar, in Jagannātha Purī, in Rāmeśvaram and similarly... //Yogīs// can do like that. //Yogīs,// they attain //asta-siddhi,// eight kinds of perfection: //animā, laghimā, mahimā, prāpti,// like that, //īśitā, vaśitā,// like that.

So the Siddhaloka means they are born //siddhas.// They haven't got to practice this mystic //yoga// system. Just like a small sparrow: it can fly automatically. Why a small sparrow? Even a small insect. But if you want to fly, you have to create so many big machineries. So in that case, in the matter of flying, the small insect or the small sparrow is //siddha.// You are trying to fly in the sky with so many jets and 747, what is called, Jumbo. But a small fly, it can fly immediately, I mean, two miles within some seconds. So they are //siddhas.// What you cannot do, if other can do, that is called //siddhi.// So there is no question of disbelieving. We can see so many small insects, birds, they can fly from one tree to another. You cannot do that. If you have to go from one tree to another, you have to take so many trouble. So it is not to be rejected, "Ah, there cannot be any... This is unbelievable." But we have got this information from the //śāstras.// We are staunch believer: "Yes, there are //siddhas.//" We are believers. That is called theism: one who believes in the statements of //śāstra.//

So there are //siddhas.// So they also came. //Sura-gaṇā, brahmādayaā sura-gaṇā munayaḥ. Muna, muni,// great personalities, philosophers, they are called //muni, ṛṣi. Devarṣi-bhūtāpta-nṛṇāṁ pitṛṇām// [SB 11.5.41]. Very highly intelligent persons, thoughtful persons, philosophers, scientists, mathematicians, so they are called also //muni.// So they came also to satisfy. And not these ordinary //munis,// but very exalted //munis// and //siddhas// from Siddhaloka. There are many //lokas:// Caraṇaloka, other. They are all described. So if there is chance, we shall present these //lokas,// how they are situated, where they are situated, how they are moving, how the sun is moving around them. The sun is not fixed up; sun is moving. So all these things, we have got such dream to show. If there is opportunity, we shall do---the Siddhas and the //sura-gaṇās// and the //munayas.//

But because they are on the planetary system, higher planetary system... There are three planetary systems. One is called higher, //ūrdhvaloka,// and middle, //madhyaloka... Bhūr, bhuvaḥ, sva,// up to Svargaloka. We are chanting Gāyatrī, //om bhūr bhuvaḥ sva tat savitur vareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi.// These are praising the //lokas,// different planetary system, of which the sunlight is the chief. //Savitur sakala-grahāṇām.// He is the chief of all planets.

> yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇām
> rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ
> yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.52]

The sun is not fixed up; sun is moving. The modern scientists or astronomers, they say, "Sun is fixed up. The earth is moving." So we don't say that. It is sa... //Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.// It has got its orbit. So there are so many things to be known still from Vedic literature. It is not yet unfolded, but we are trying.

//Siddhya...// So //sattvaika.// They are //sattvaika.// They are all. All the inhabitants of the upper planetary system, they are in //sattvika-guṇa,// brahminical qualification. They are not //mlecchas// and //yavanas. Brāhmaṇas. Sattvaikatāna-gatayo.// They are not ordinary. Just like here the //sattvika// means pure //brāhmaṇa. Śamo damaḥ satyaṁ śaucaṁ titikṣa ārjavam, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. So most of them are //brāhmaṇas// or even //kṣatriyas.// Mostly they are //brāhmaṇas.// So //ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ// [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]. You have seen in the //Bhagavad-gītā:// "Those who are situated in //sattva-guṇa,// they are promoted to the higher planetary system after death." //Madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasaḥ:// "And those who are in the //rajo-guṇa,// they remain in the middle planetary system." //Jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ:// "And those who are in //tāmasika,// in the darkness, ignorance modes of material nature, they go down to the..., down planetary system or animal life."

So this is an opportunity, this human form of life, to decide where you want to go. Are you going to hell or heaven or back to home, or back to Godhead? That you have to decide. This is human intelligence, not like working like cats and dogs and dying like cats and dogs. That is not human life. Human life is meant for to decide where you want to go next. By the evolutionary process you have come to this human form of life. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāni sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati// [Padma Purāṇa]. By going through so many, 8,400,000 species of life, you have got this human form of life. Now you decide where you'll go. So where I have to go, how to go, there is that information in the //śāstra. Śāstra-cakṣuṣaḥ:// see through the //śāstra// where you can go. And the master of the //śāstra,// Kṛṣṇa, is giving you personally instruction,

> ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā
> madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ
> jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā
> adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ
> [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṛn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā
> mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

These informations are there. Why you are missing this opportunity? Huh? If you like, you can go to the higher planetary system. If you like, you can go back to home, back to Godhead. //Mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām.// These informations are there.

So without //sattva-guṇa,// if you keep people in the //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa,// then your..., their future is lost. //Rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa// means people will become more greedy and lusty, that's all. And greedy and lusty means cats and dogs, animal life. Animal life. They're trying to eat---no discrimination of eating. So that is hog's life. The hog has no discrimination of eating. It can eat even stool. So the... If you eat, become like hog---no discrimination of eating, whatever you..., just like so many //svāmīs,// they say, "Oh, why there is restriction of eating? You can eat anything you like." So nature will give you: "All right, you want to eat anything you like? All right, you become a hog. You eat even stool." //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantor dehopapatti// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. You have to change your body. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muḥ...// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. You may say that there is no life after, but that is foolishness. You are under the control of material nature.

> prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
> guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
> ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
> kartāham iti manyate
> [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]

You may falsely be proud. You say, "No, no, I shall not become old man. I shall remain young." But nature will not allow you. Nature will force you to take the old man's body.

But these foolish people, they are thinking "independent." You are not independent. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. //Sad-asad,// good birth or low-class birth, //sad-asad,// that is... How it is done? //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya:// as you make association with the //guṇas//---//sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// If you associate with //sattva-guṇa,// then you get //sad-janma// next life. And if you associate with //tamo-guṇa,// then you get //tamo-guṇa// life. After death your so much prestigious position, so much proud---everything will be finished. Then you are completely under the laws of nature and you have to accept a body and..., according to your quality. This is the way. But they do not know.

Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja said that "I am born in //ugra-yoni,// so how can I offer my prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead?" But he was born in the //ugra// family, but he was devotee. He's qualified because a devotee is neither belonging to any of these material qualities.

> māṁ cāvyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

Anyone who is engaged in devotional service, he does not belong to any of these material qualities. //Sa guṇān samatītyaitān.// All these qualities, he is transcendental. //Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.// Prahlāda Mahārāja, although born of a demonic father, he was completely pure. He was completely on the transcendental stage. Therefore he could offer prayers to the Lord; others cannot. So a Vaiṣṇava is very humble. He... Although everyone has admitted that he is on the stage of //prema,// but he is a Vaiṣṇava. He's thinking that "I am the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu. How I can offer?" This is Vaiṣṇava humbleness. That is the teaching of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

One has to become humbler than the grass and tolerant than the tree. Then he can become perfect Vaiṣṇava. Because as soon as you become a Vaiṣṇava, your father will be your enemy. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. What was his fault, five-years-old boy? Simply he became a Vaiṣṇava, Kṛṣṇa conscious, and his father became enemy. This is the position.

So Vaiṣṇava has to tolerate in order to make progress in spiritual life so many enemies. Even at home, father will be enemy. So don't be hesitant and don't be agitated by such circumstances. Prahlāda Mahārāja had to suffer so many things. Still, he remained Kṛṣṇa conscious, and ultimately he saw Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva and had the privilege of offering prayers. We shall discuss later on.

Thank you very much. [end]
