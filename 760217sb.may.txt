Translation "Prahlāda Mahārāja continued to think that a brāhmaṇa who has qualified himself with all the brahminical qualities, twelve in number, as they are stated in the book known as Sanat-sujāta, such a brāhmaṇa, if he is not a devotee and averse to the lotus feet of the Lord, he is especially lower than a devotee who is a dog-eater even, but his mind, words, activities, wealth and life---everything---is dedicated to the Supreme Lord. Such a low person is better than a brāhmaṇa as above mentioned because such lowborn person can purify his whole family, whereas a so-called brāhmaṇa falsely in prestigious position cannot purify himself."

**Prabhupāda:**

> viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha-
> pādāravinda-vimukhāt śvapacaṁ variṣṭham

This is the verdict of the //śāstra: śvapacaṁ variṣṭham.//

> manye tad-arpita-mano-vacanehitārtha-
> prāṇam punāti sa kulaṁ na tu bhūrimānaḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:10|[SB 7.9.10]]]

//Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. This is Prahlāda Mahārāja's instruction, that don't be falsely proud unless you have got the qualification. That is our mistake, //dambha, dambha.// And the pure life begins when we give up //dambha,// false prestige. //Adambhitvam amānitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.8]]]. This is the begin... One who is falsely proud, he is... [aside:] What is that sound? One should not be falsely proud. Everyone... Material world means everyone is falsely proud. Everyone is thinking, //āḍhyo 'smi dhanavān asmi ko 'sti mama samaḥ.// Everyone. This is the disease. "I am the richest," "I am the powerful," "I am the very intelligent." Everything, "I am." This is called //ahaṅkāra. Ahaṅkāra vimudhātmā kartāham iti manyate// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. This false prestige, when one is absorbed with false things, he becomes //vimūḍha,// rascal. //Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate.// This is false prestige. We have to give up this false prestige. //Ahaṅkāra// must be there, because you are a reality. You are not false. Your body is false, but you are reality: "I am soul." That realization must come: //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// Not that //ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā,// "I am dog," "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am this." This is //ahaṅkāra,// this false //ahaṅkāra.// But giving up all these nonsense prestigious position... A dog is also thinking he's in a prestigious position: "I am dog. I can bark very loudly. //Gow! Gow!//" He's also thinking that. Similarly, if I also think, "I am Indian," "I am white," "I am black," "I am this," what is the difference? Therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. He is completely under the control of material nature, and he's thinking falsely that "I am very advanced in...," so on, so on. This should be given up.

So how it is given up? When one becomes devotee. //Manye tad-arpita-mano-vaca.// One who has given everything to Kṛṣṇa, the our //sannyāsa, tri-daṇḍa,// that is //tad-arpita-mano-vaca. Tri-daṇḍa// means "I am accepting, my Lord, three kinds of chastisement from You, that I dedicate my body, my mind and my //vaca,// my words." This is called //tri-daṇḍa.// You should understand, those who are //sannyāsīs, tri-daṇḍa-sannyāsī.// The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// they take one //daṇḍa. Eka brahma dvitīya nāsti.// That is their philosophy, that "Only Brahman is there, and nothing else. So I am Brahman; you are Brahman"---one, monism. That is their philosophy. Of course, that is our philosophy also, because everything is Kṛṣṇa. Nothing... There is nothing except Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa said in the //Bhagavad..., mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam:// "Everything I am." But their mistake is that because everything is Kṛṣṇa, er, Kṛṣṇa is everything, therefore everything is Kṛṣṇa. No, that is mistake. That Kṛṣṇa explains, that:

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]

This is the mistake committed by the Māyāvādīs, that "If everything is Brahman, then whatever I worship, that is all right." That is nonsense. Kṛṣṇa says, //nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ.// Just like this microphone: it is Kṛṣṇa. But if I worship this microphone instead of the Deity, then I am a fool. Then I am fool. This is the mistake the Māyāvādīs commit. They put the argument, "If everything is Kṛṣṇa, everything is Brahman, so whatever I worship, that is Brahman." Kṛṣṇa says, "No. That is not. Everything is Myself." This is called simultaneously one and different, //acintya-bhedābheda-tattva. Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. This is there in the //Brahma-saṁhitā.// Kṛṣṇa is always in Goloka. Just like here is Kṛṣṇa. He's in Goloka, but He's so powerful, omnipotent... This is called omnipotency. In spite of His becoming in Goloka, He's everywhere. That is Kṛṣṇa.

That is the difference between Kṛṣṇa and you or me. I am here; I'm not in upstairs. I'm here only. But Kṛṣṇa simultaneously can be everywhere. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. So many pretenders, they claim that they are God: "I am God." But are you present everywhere? Can you say what I am thinking now? No. That he cannot. Still, he claims "God." Nonsense. How he can become God? If you cannot say what I am thinking now, then how you can become God? God is situated everywhere. //Aṇḍāntara-sthaṁ paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. Everywhere. //Paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham.// Even within the atom there is God. So how you can claim "God"? //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Then they will answer, "I'm not in God now. I am God, but //māyā...// Therefore I cannot say now." That... "Why you have become under the control of //māyā?// Then //māyā// is greater than God. Then how you can become God? //Māyā// is greater than God." So they cannot answer this. Because their theory is foolish, they cannot answer all these things. Actually, unless one is a devotee, he'll have all these bad qualification.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja is thinking himself that "I am less than //śvapaca.//" Just like //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// author says,

> purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha
> jagāi mādhāi haite muñi se pāpiṣṭha
> [[books:cc:adi:5:205|[Cc. Ādi 5.205]]]

He said that "I am insignificant, more insignificant than the stool-worm." The worm... There are worms in the stool. "So I am lower than that." //Purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha:// "My value is less than the worm in the stool." This is called //tṛṇād api sunīcena.// It is not that Kavirāja Gosvāmī is artificially posing in that way. No. He's sincerely... No Vaiṣṇava thinks himself, "I am very big man." No. He's not Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava means //tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]. This is Vaiṣṇava. Even he is exalted more than anyone in this world, still he thinks himself as lowest: "I am lower than the worm in the stool." Prahlāda Mahārāja, Vaiṣṇava, he is engaged to offer prayers to the Lord, Nṛsiṁha-deva. So he's thinking in that way, that "What...? What form of prayer I can offer? I am born in a demonic family, low-grade family, and Brahmā, he's coming from Brahmaloka, Satyaloka, Janaloka. They are so exalted. They could not satisfy the anger of the Lord, and I am born in low family. How can I do this?" This is his idea.

But he's taking courage in this way, that in the //śāstra// it is accepted that even one is born in low, low-grade family, //śvapaca... Śvapaca// means the most low grade. They're eating pigs. Now, according to Vedic civilization, the pig-eater, even cow-flesh eater is given better position. But the pig-eaters, they are the lowest, //śvapacas,// untouchable. They are called untouchable. Any meat-eater is untouchable, but especially the pig-eater, //śvapaca.// In India still, no even meat-eaters... Generally those who are meat-eaters, they take meat of such animals like goats, lambs, like that, those who are meat-eaters. And they never take cow's flesh because cow is protected, //go-raksya.// So in the //Bhagavad-gītā// to the meat-eaters also it is said, //kṛṣi go-rakṣya vāṇijyam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. Even if you are meat-eater, don't eat cow. You can eat others animals. But don't eat... "We are //śvapacas,//" //śvapaca// is there. So if you are at all meat-eater, you can eat pigs, goats, but don't eat cow's flesh. That is very sinful. Why it is sinful? Because it's a very, very important animal in the human society. Very important animal. You get milk and milk products, then your brain becomes very nice, memory sharpened. That is, therefore, important. Don't eat. It is economically.

So //śvapacaṁ variṣṭham.// Who is that //śvapaca?// Now, who has given everything to Kṛṣṇa, //tri-daṇḍa.// That means even a person coming out of the family of a //śvapaca,// dog-eaters, dog-eaters, pig-eaters, yes. //Śvapaca// means dog-eater. Yes. Pig-eaters are also better. But the dog-eaters, they are the lowest. I think in China and Korea they are very much fond of dog-eating. So they are the lowest. So if... So here it is proof that dog-eaters or pig-eaters or any low-grade man is not prohibited to become a devotee. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They say that without becoming a Hindu or born in India, nobody can become //brāhmaṇa,// nobody can become //sannyāsī.// But here is the proof. In the //śāstra// it says, //śvapacaṁ variṣṭham.// The dog-eater is also highly praised. When? //Tad-arpita-mano-vacana:// "When he sacrifices everything---his body, his mind, his words---only for Kṛṣṇa." This is called //tri-daṇḍa-sannyāsa.// So why the low-grade man cannot be offered //tri-daṇḍa// if he is qualified? If he has dedicated everything to Kṛṣṇa, why he should be prohibited? No. That is not the śāstric injunction. Śāstric injunction is for anyone. Nobody is prohibited to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]], Kṛṣṇa says. Kṛṣṇa says even //pāpa-yoni,// less than the //śūdra... Śūdra// is also //pāpa-yoni.// Even woman is called //pāpa-yoni// according to strict... //Striyaḥ śūdras tathā vaiśya. Vaiśya.// Except //brāhmaṇa// and //kṣatriyas,// everyone is considered to be lowborn, according to the Vedic injunction. But not that because he is lowborn, he cannot elevate himself. That is not the fact. The present, so-called Hindu society is degraded because if one is born in higher family, //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya//---he may be less than a //śvapaca//---he's accepted as a //brāhmaṇa.// That is the fault.

But //śāstra// does not say that without... Even if you are born in a high family, //brāhmaṇa// family, //kṣatriya// family, and if you do not act or if have not the qualification of //brāhmaṇa, dvi-ṣaṭ,// twelve qualifications... What is that? //Dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda...// That is explained, what are the twelve qualifications. //Dharmaḥ:// "He must be strictly religious principles." //Dharmaḥ. Dharmaḥ// begins strictly when one is fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. There begins //dharmaḥ,// because Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He says that //dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. He comes to establish the principles of //dharma.// And why He is speaking //sarva-dharmān parityajya?// Why? If He has come to reestablish the principles of //dharma-dharma-saṁsthāpanārtha,// then why He says //sarva-dharm...? Sarva// so-called //dharmas,// they are not //dharma. Dharma// means //dharmāṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. //Dharma// means the order that is given by God. That is //dharma.// And anything, so-called //dharma,// that is not //dharma.// That you manufacture, so many things. That is another thing. But real //dharma,// the... Just like I have several times explained, law means given by the government. You cannot manufacture law. That is not law. Similarly, //dharma// means the order given by God. That is //dharma.// Just like Kṛṣṇa says. He said, //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]: "When there is discrepancies, misuse of //dharma,// I appear." So He has appeared. He therefore said that "This is not //dharma.//" You are declaring, "This is Hindu //dharma,//" "This is Muslim //dharma,//" "This is Jain //dharma,//" "This is Christian //dharma,//" "This is family //dharma,//" "This is country //dharma,//" so on, so on, so on. You have created so many //dharmas.// But Kṛṣṇa said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You give up all these //dharmas.//" "Then what I..., shall I accept?" //Mam ekam śaraṇaṁ vraja.// That is //dharma.// Otherwise there is no //dharma.//

The //Bhāgavata// also says, //dharmaḥ-projjhita-kaitavo 'tra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]: "The so-called //dharmas,// cheating process, is given up, kicked out." //Projjhita. Prakṛṣṭa-rūpena ujjhita.// That is called //projjhita.// Śrīdhara Svami gives his note in this connection: //atra mokṣa-vāñchā api nirastam.// Anyone who is desiring for liberation, that is also cheating. That is also cheating. How you can be liberated? You are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. Where is your liberation? You must serve Kṛṣṇa. That is your //dharma. Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]]. If you don't serve Kṛṣṇa, then you are immediately culprit, immediately punishable. That is going on. //Māyā// is engaged to punish.

> kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare
> pāsate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhāre
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

As soon as. As soon as one tries to become independent without serving Kṛṣṇa, that means he is in //māyā.// He's in //māyā.// Immediately //māyā// is there. Just like as soon as you become a criminal, a thief, immediately you are under the jurisdiction of the police, immediately, without the... You may hide yourself for time being, but immediately you have become criminal. Similarly, as soon as one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's immediately a criminal, punishable. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ, māyayāpahṛta...// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. He does not know what he's doing, this rascal //narādhamāḥ, mūḍha.// These //mūḍhas...// Therefore when we say that a man who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is //narādhamāḥ, mūḍhāḥ,// that is a fact. But the world is such that //satyaṁ bruyāt priyaṁ bruyāt ma bruyāt satyam apriyam.// They want if you can say the truth, but don't say the unpalatable truth. But that is social etiquette. When you speak about spiritual life there is no such scope. You must speak this truth: "Yes, you are rascal. Because you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, you are rascal, //mūḍha.// You are sinful. You are lowest of the mankind." Kṛṣṇa says. Kṛṣṇa says, //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ.//

So this is the test. This is the test: that as soon as one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, immediately he comes to the group of sinful activities, rascaldom, lowest of the mankind, //māyayāpahṛta-jñānā,// all knowledge taken away, and he's an //asura,// Hiraṇyakaśipu's family, Hiraṇyakaśipu's category. So this is not optional, that "If I don't take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is my wish, my desire." No. If you desire in that way, then you'll be punished. You'll become immediately... You cannot say, "It is my optional. I may become a thief; I may remain honest. That is my option." No. As soon as you become thief, you are punishable. Similarly, anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's immediately punishable. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. The punishment will go on in various ways. That is going on. //Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. The punishment... This is punishment. That is presented by Kṛṣṇa. //Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. This //duḥkha, janma-mṛtyu,// repeatedly to take birth and die, this is punishment. But these rascals, they do not care for it. They have become so rascal that "Oh, oh, that //mṛtyu?// I shall die, because it is nature." Why it has become your nature? Your nature is eternity. But they have no brain to understand. They have become so foolish. //Nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. The spirit soul... I am soul; you are soul. I am not dying. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.// But these foolish persons, they do not know. They accept death, birth and death, old age and disease. There is no remedy. The so-called scientists, philosophers, they cannot give any remedy. The only remedy is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That they do not know. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya.// That is remedy. You have to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

> janma karma ca me divyaṁ
> yo jānāti tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti mām eti kaunteya
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

This is... If you want to be really happy, if you want to be really in your original position, eternity, then you must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is no alternative. It is not possible. It is not optional. The more you delay accepting Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the more you are put into sufferings of this material world. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja said that... The brahminical qualification is certainly very good. Within this material world there are three modes of material nature: //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// Those who are in the //tamo-guṇa,// they are the lowest, //mūḍhā, narādhamā. Rajo-guṇa,// they are little better. They have got some activities, just like materialistic person. But //sattva-guṇa,// they are simply interested in spiritual realization. So spiritual realization means God realization. Unless one becomes a devotee... Just like in our Indian society, they say //brāhmaṇa paṇḍita// and //brāhmaṇa// Vaiṣṇava. So //paṇḍita,// that is general qualification. Without becoming a //paṇḍita,// he's not a //brāhmaṇa.// But above //paṇḍita,// one has to become a Vaiṣṇava. Then he's perfect //brāhmaṇa, brāhmaṇa// Vaiṣṇava.

So these are the twelve qualification of the //brāhmaṇa// enunciated in the //dharma-śāstra.// There are twenty kinds of //dharma-śāstra.// The most important of the //dharma-śāstras// is the //Manu-saṁhitā.// [break] ...and doing all nonsense. Such kind of //bhakti, aikāntikī harer bhak..., utpātāyeva kalpate:// it is simply disturbance in the society, without full knowledge from the //śruti-smṛti,// if by sentiments one becomes //bhakta.// That is not //bhakta. Bhakta// must be following the regulative principles, the instruction of //guru// and so on. So here Prahlāda Mahārāja said the //dvādaśa-guṇa.// The //dvādaśa-guṇa// is //dharmaś ca, dharmasya satyaṁ ca dhāmaś ca tapaś ca amātsarya hi titiksa-anusūyava-yajñāś ca dānaṁ dhṛtiḥ sutaṁ ca vratāni vai dvādaśa brāhmaṇasya.// So one must be qualified with these twelve qualities. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is given, nine qualities, so, //śama dama satyaṁ śaucam, jñānam-vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma sva-bhāva...// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. So you cannot become a //brāhmaṇa// simply by becoming a son of a //brāhmaṇa.// That is not possible. That is not the injunction. Just like you cannot become a high-court judge simply by becoming the son of a high-court judge. No. You must be qualified how to become a high-court judge. Then you'll be accepted. Not that... You cannot say, "I am... My father is high-court judge; I am high-court judge." That is going on. No. So here are the qualities of a //brāhmaṇa, dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād viprāt.// Must be there, twelve qualities; at least nine qualities. Then you become a //brāhmaṇa.// And Nārada Muni supports this in another place, that,

> yasya hi yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ
> varṇābhivyāñjakam
> yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta
> tat tenaiva vinirdiśet
> [[books:sb:7:11:35|[SB 7.11.35]]]

Nārada Muni said, the greatest authority. He said that these are the qualities of //brāhmaṇa,// as described. If these qualities are found elsewhere, //anyatra.// Suppose a man is born in the //śūdra// family, but he has developed these qualities, then he should be called a //brāhmaṇa.// And suppose a person is born in the //brāhmaṇa// family but he has acquired the qualities of //śūdra// or //caṇḍāla,// then he should be called //caṇḍāla.// This is Nārada Muni's statement. And Śrīdhāra Swami gives his comment upon this //śloka,// that birth is not primary; the qualities are primary.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja also explained. Prahlāda means he is in the Satya-yuga, long, long, millions and millions... The principles was this, that simply born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, he does not become, even with qualities. He must be a devotee. And a devotee, if he, even if he's born in a family of dog-eaters, he is //variṣṭham.// He is fully qualified. We shall discuss again.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
