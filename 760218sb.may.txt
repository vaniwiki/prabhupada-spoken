Translation: "Specifically the Supreme Lord, the Personality of Godhead, is always full in satisfaction by Himself. Therefore, when something is offered to Him, it is for the benefit of the devotee. The Lord does not require any service from anyone. The example is given here that if the original face is decorated, then the reflection in the mirror is seen with face decorated."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm? //Naivātmanaḥ prabhur ayaṁ nija-lābha-pūrṇo// [[books:sb:7:9:11|[SB 7.9.11]]]. //Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. Everything is complete; therefore Kṛṣṇa is God. Everything, whatever we require... We require money, //aiśvarya.// We require strength. We require influence. We require education. So many things we require. //Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇaḥ. Nija-lābha-pūrṇaḥ.// Another definition of Kṛṣṇa is He's full with six kinds of opulences. So He's sufficient to fulfill His desire. He doesn't require anyone's service. Just like we are in need of so many things; therefore we require others' help. But Kṛṣṇa does not require anyone's help. Then why He accepts worship? That is the... That is for the benefit of the devotee, not for His personal benefit. Just like Lord Rāmacandra, He... His one wife Sītādeva was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa. Of course, Rāvaṇa cannot kidnap. It was externally, Māyā Sītā. Still, taking for exception that Sītā was kidnapped, so Lord Rāmacandra could have possessed many millions of Sītā by His will, but for one Sītā He had to fight with Rāvaṇa and finish the whole dynasty, because Rāmacandra is the ideal king. It is the king's business to chastise such rogues and ruffians. That is king's business. That is for the benefit of Rāvaṇa. Rāvaṇa means the same Hiraṇyakaśipu. Kumbhakarṇa-Rāvaṇa. First they became Hiraṇyakṣa and Hiraṇyakaśipu; the next, Kumbhakarṇa and Rāvaṇa; and the next, they became Śiśupāla and Dantavakra. In this way, because Kṛṣṇa wanted to give them liberation again back to home, back to Godhead, so this killing of Rāvaṇa, killing of Hiraṇyakaśipu, killing of Śiśupāla is for the benefit of the persons, not for Kṛṣṇa's benefit. He killed them for their benefit.

So whatever Kṛṣṇa does, that is for our benefit. Kṛṣṇa incarnates, comes here... //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. So He has no benefit by coming here, neither He has any loss. He's so complete that there is no loss, no benefit. But His mission is //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya...// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. Just to keep balance of the demonic activities and to favor the devotees, both of them are benefited. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnām,// those who are devotees, they are also benefited, and the demons who are killed by Kṛṣṇa, they are also benefited. That is Kṛṣṇa. That is all-good. "God is good" means when He's favoring somebody and when He's killing somebody, both of them are benefited. Therefore God is always good, both ways. //Nija-lābha.// He has no business to kill anybody as His enemy. Nobody can become His enemy. It is simply childish---just to knock one's head on the mountain to break the mountain. If one thinks that "I shall knock my head to the mountain, and the mountain will break," that is foolishness. Your head will be broken. That's all. Similarly, as friend, nobody can give any service to Kṛṣṇa, or as enemy, nobody can give any trouble to Kṛṣṇa. //Nija-lābha-pūrṇa.// This is //nija-lābha-pūrṇa.// He's always full with all satisfaction. So why Kṛṣṇa says, //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]? So does it mean that Kṛṣṇa is so hungry that He has come to beg from us a little flower, little fruit? That some rascal taken this, that Kṛṣṇa comes as beggar, //daridra?// So when Kṛṣṇa comes as opulent Personality of Godhead, they are not interested to serve Him, but when Kṛṣṇa comes as //daridra,// then they're interested.

So these are all foolishness. Kṛṣṇa is neither //daridra,// but //karuṇam. Karuṇaṁ vṛṇīte.// Just to show His causeless mercy upon us, He says that "Give me something. Even if you are very poor man, so give Me something, whatever you can secure very easily." //Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ. Patraṁ// you can get anywhere, without any price. //Puṣpam// also you can get anywhere, and //toyam,// that also get, you can get. So simply collect for Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that "I'll serve Kṛṣṇa with this endeavor. I'll collect something." What you'll collect? It is Kṛṣṇa's money. Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. So what you can collect? It is Kṛṣṇa's. Just like we are constructing this temple. We are feeling that "I am constructing. We are constructing," but actually it is Kṛṣṇa's. The bricks, the iron or the cement or anything that you are collecting, that is Kṛṣṇa's property. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam.// The brick is not your property. The earth is not your property. You are taking Kṛṣṇa's earth, and you are making it a brick. Still, it is Kṛṣṇa's property. But the endeavor, the energy which you are giving to Kṛṣṇa, that is taken into account: "Oh, he is working for Me. He wants to give Me something." That Kṛṣṇa consciousness is important. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa can... By His will He can construct sixteen thousand palaces for His queen. What this teeny temple will satisfy Him? But still, He's satisfied: "Oh, you have done so much? Very good." Recognized. Kṛṣṇa has created the whole universe. //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kāla.// He doesn't require any endeavor. Simply by breathing, //yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// [Bs. 5.48]. By His breathing, many millions of Brahmās are coming out, //jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ.// And each //jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ,// Brahmā, is creating a universe. //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya// [Bs. 5.48]. So to create a temple, He doesn't require our help. He can create millions of temples by His will. There are already.

So we should always remember this, that Kṛṣṇa does not require our service, but if we give some service to Kṛṣṇa, that is our benefit. This is the formula. Don't think that Kṛṣṇa is very much obliged. But He feels obliged. Why? //Aviduṣaḥ.// We are all fools and rascals. We are thinking that we are giving some service. No. We cannot give any. We are so insignificant that we cannot. He's unlimited, and we are very, very limited, teeny. But still, just the small child gives something to the father... It is father's property, but still, the father is very glad that "This child is giving me a lozenges." He thinks, "This is my big property." [laughs] So always we should remember this verse, that //naivātmanaḥ prabhur ayaṁ nija-lābha-pūrṇaḥ.// He's always full with six opulences. There is no question of satisfying by giving something. This //daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā// has come under this misunderstanding, that "We have to serve God, so when God comes as //daridra,// then we shall give. When God comes with Lakṣmī, with Sītā, with Rādhārāṇī, no, no, that is not required. We don't want to serve that God. We want to serve when God comes as poor man, as invalid with a stick, and begs. Oh, I am so great. I am giving God." This is nonsense. This is not... What God cares for you? But they have conceived that, that "God, although He is great, he becomes a small beggar and begs from me." This is material conception of understanding.

So here it is clear, //nija-lābha-pūrṇaḥ.// He's not... He's Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. He's Nārāyaṇa, and why He should become poor? He... //Lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ// [Bs. 5.29]. Not only one Lakṣmī, not one Rukmiṇī, but many thousands Lakṣmī---//sahasra-sata,// many //lakhs.// We are flattering Lakṣmījī, "Give me some favor," but Kṛṣṇa doesn't flatter anyone. Sometimes He does out of love to Rādhārāṇī. That Lakṣmī is Rādhārāṇī. Therefore She is the topmost of all Lakṣmīs. So why Kṛṣṇa will be beggar, //daridra?// No. There is no possibility. Here Kṛṣṇa is present in this temple. He has become very handy so that we can offer our dress, offer our foodstuff, whatever we can. He can become still smaller. //Anor anīyāṁ mahato mahīyān.// If you want to worship Him as the //virata-puruṣa,// then He can show you the //virāṭa-puruṣa.// The sky is the head and the Pātāla is the leg. He can become so big that you will be frightened, as Arjuna became frightened after seeing. He can become. That is called Brahman. //Bṛhatvād bṛhaṇatvāt.// He can become the bigger than the biggest, and He can become smaller than the smallest. That is Kṛṣṇa.

So if we actually want to serve according to our means, Kṛṣṇa is ready to accept our service. But you cannot think that "Without my service, Kṛṣṇa is starving." No, that is not. //Nija-lābha-pūrṇaḥ.// He's always complete in Himself. He doesn't require our help. But if we serve Kṛṣṇa, then we become benefited. That is... //Yad yaj jano bhagavate vidadhīta mānam.// If you offer respect, Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's representative, then you'll be respectful. If you don't want to show respect to Kṛṣṇa and His representative, then you'll be derided. Therefore //prati-mukhasya yathā mukha-śrīḥ. Prati-mukhasya,// original face, original person, is Kṛṣṇa. If you decorate Kṛṣṇa very nicely, then you will be also seen very much decorated. If you... Practically we see. That is no fable. We are offering Kṛṣṇa nice foodstuff, so we are eating this nice //prasādam// which we never conceived or dreamed, dreamt in our life. So because we are offering to Kṛṣṇa, we become so fortunate to taste this nice //prasādam.// Kṛṣṇa, //nija-lābha-pūrṇaḥ.// It is not that if you give a nice plate of foodstuff, Kṛṣṇa eats everything, and you simply see the empty dish. No. Kṛṣṇa eats, and again keeps it as it is for... That is Kṛṣṇa. //Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. The atheist class of men, they think, "We offered so many things. Kṛṣṇa did not eat." No. He has eaten, but He is //nija-lābha-pūrṇaḥ.// He is not hungry, but whatever you have offered, He has eaten. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Everyone was offering so many things, it was stocked. And Govinda one day informed Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Sir, people bring so many nice foodstuff for You. It is stocked. Practically the whole room is filled up, and when they ask me that 'Whether Caitanya Mahāprabhu has eaten my offering?' I say, 'Yes, yes, He has eaten.' So I have to tell so many lies, and the stock is there. You do not eat." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "All right, bring them here." So one after one, the whole room was finished. Caitanya Mahāprabhu ate everything. Then He asked him, "Bring more." "No, Sir, only the empty pots are there." "All right, stop." So this is Kṛṣṇa. If you offer Him huge foodstuff, He can eat. And if you can offer Him little flower, fruit and water, that also, He is satisfied. So everyone should offer according to his means, and Kṛṣṇa is ready to accept, not that you have to become a very rich man and you have to offer Kṛṣṇa foodstuff fifty-six times, as in Jagannātha Purī the foodstuffs are offered. Not that. He is pleased anyway. But become a devotee. Try to please Him to your best capacity.

You know the story of that //brāhmaṇa.// He had no means to offer anything to Kṛṣṇa, he was so poor. But he wanted to offer something, but he thought that "I am so poor. I cannot offer anything." So one day he heard from the //Bhāgavata// speech that one can offer Him within mind also. So he took it seriously, and from that day he was offering Kṛṣṇa so many nice foodstuffs, collecting water from different rivers and keeping the water in golden jugs, and bathing Kṛṣṇa and offering... This was... He was always thinking. And one day he prepared sweet rice and offered Kṛṣṇa, and he wanted to see whether rice is..., because sweet rice, very hot, is not good. Sweet rice, the more it is cooler, then it is tasteful. But milk, if you take cool, that is not tasteful. Milk you have to take hot, but not the sweet rice. So he wanted to test whether it is too hot. So his finger burned, and then his meditation broke. He saw there is no rice but finger is burned. In this way the //brāhmaṇa// was immediately taken to Vaikuṇṭha.

So Kṛṣṇa can be offered in any circumstances. Kṛṣṇa can be pleased, provided you want to please Kṛṣṇa, provided you want to serve Kṛṣṇa. There is no question of... That is already explained, that //dana, jana,// riches or learning or respectability, all these things cannot satisfy Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wants only your heart---"Kṛṣṇa, You are my eternal master. I am Your eternal servant. Please engage me in Your service."

> na danaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ
> kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye
> mama janmani janmanīśvare
> bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi
> [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]

This is the prayer. A devotee never asks Kṛṣṇa, "You give me money. You give me many followers. You give me nice wife." No. //Na danaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye.// "Then what you want?" "I want to be engaged in Your service." Not "I want." A devotee never says "I want." "Please, if You like, engage me." That is... This Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// means that. //Hare... Hare// is the addressing Rādhārāṇī, Hara; from Hara, Hare. And Kṛṣṇa... So "Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa," Hare Kṛṣṇa, "Please engage me in Your service." Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma...

**Devotees:**
...Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we should simply pray, "Kindly engage me in Your service in whatever capacity You like." I have got my own desire, so Kṛṣṇa gives us freedom: "In whichever capacity you want to serve Me, I shall accept, either as servant, either as friend, either as father, mother, or either as conjugal lover." Any way, Kṛṣṇa is ready to accept our service. And He does not require any service, but if we render service, that is our benefit. That is required. And this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement it teaching that "Try to serve Kṛṣṇa." That is the beginning of teaching of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Jivera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]]. They are trying to be master. That is //māyā.// It is not possible to become //māyā,// er, master. You cannot become master. If you think that you are going to be master, that is //māyā.//

> prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
> guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
> ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
> kartāham iti manyate
> [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]

They think like that, but nobody can be master. But the fools, rascals, they want to become master, and when they fail, then they want to become one with the God, the supreme master. This is going on. They are all //māyā,// illusion. The real life is to remain eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa and offer service to Him to the best capacity. That is perfection of life.

Thank you very much. [end]
