**Prabhupāda:**
//Ahaituky apratihatā// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]].

**Acyutānanda:**
//Jāy sakal bipod.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
//Jāy sakal bipod.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Acyutānanda:**
Bhaktivinoda... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[chants //japa//] ...times it is speedy, sometimes slow. Therefore day and night, there's time difference. It is moving. It is not fixed.

**Acyutānanda:**
//Bhagavad-gītā's// Battle of Kurukṣetra fought in which month?

**Prabhupāda:**
That I do not know. Why?

**Acyutānanda:**
Because they have a //Gītā// day, I think, in November, where they claim that they have found the day... December?

**Yaśodānandana:**
December, beginning of December.

**Acyutānanda:**
So that, and the eighteen days' war, and then the //Uttarāyaṇa// begins in the middle of January. So I was thinking that Bhīṣma was lying on the battlefield for almost a month or more.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
That Bhīṣma was waiting, lying on the battlefield for about thirty or forty days. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...was to die when he liked. That was his special privilege.

**Acyutānanda:**
What?

**Prabhupāda:**
You die when he liked. That was the benediction upon him. And Gandhi will say //dharma-kṣetra// means this body.

**Indian man:**
[indistinct] Balarāma and Subhadrā month, is that on the same, the next month, He came?

**Prabhupāda:**
He came one //sūrya-grahaṇa// occasion. [break] ...in America. That is better than calling a government. What is the government? I don't care for them, these politicians. In America I never attempted to see the politicians, secretary and... Never attempted. I was sitting down under the tree and playing my //dundubhi.//

**Dayānanda:**
Yes. For one year the Marquis of Zetland was interested, and then what is the use? After that, then finished.

**Prabhupāda:**
Finished.

**Dayānanda:**
Just five hundred pounds spent in two years, and then nothing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then nothing.

**Dayānanda:**
In 1933, '34. But you have, you have done so much. Even..., even though you just had some low-class persons, you have transformed them all. And now it is a very wonderful...

**Prabhupāda:**
The Ramakrishna Mission man came to see me. He said that "You dress like American. Otherwise nobody will take you as important."

**Acyutānanda:**
Nikhilananda...

**Prabhupāda:**
And "I don't want to be important. I have no dress. If you pay for it, I can dress. I have no money. I know how to dress as a European. As business man, I was doing that. But not this shabby dress. You must give me four set of nice dress, [laughter] changing every alternate day. I know how to do it, but I have no money." [end]
