**Prabhupāda:**
...mind, don't express. Don't disclose. And besides that, we should not think anyone as our enemy. They are misled. Let us do our own duty. [//japa//] Who has broken this? [break] ...disease. Just like a man is diseased, and a surgeon is operating. He's calling by ill names, "You rascal, you //śālā,// you //barja//[?], you are killing me." So that does not mean he'll stop his business. [laughs] And when he's relieved: "Oh, you are my friend. You have done so good. You are not my //śālā.//" Just see.

**Acyutānanda:**
Why do they say "//śālā//"?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śālā// is a abominable term. //Śālā// means wife's brother.

**Acyutānanda:**
Why is that abominable?

**Prabhupāda:**
The country, you see? But advanced devotee, they'll not think anyone as enemy. You see? Diseased man... //Piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya, māyā-grasta jīvera haya se bhāva udaya// [//Prema-vivarta//]. Just like one is ghostly-haunted, he talks all nonsense. [break] ...proposal, there cannot be any two opinions. Let them join, anyone.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Come on. Money problem, we shall solve. You come and join. Preach. Where is the objection?

**Acyutānanda:**
In America that is called "entrepreneur."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Acyutānanda:**
If you back and forward another man to... Usually it's in entertainment, to be a famous actor or a singer, then a man will be behind, supplying money and publicity and everything. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...well, let them translate all our English literature. We shall publish in Bengali.

**Acyutānanda:**
I don't think they have that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
They're not educated.

**Jayapatākā:**
Parvat.

**Acyutānanda:**
Who is that?

**Jayapatākā:**
The one that calls me "//prabhu.//"

**Acyutānanda:**
Parvat. Parvat, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has not such quandary. [break] ...he'll come with us, work with us.

**Acyutānanda:**
And if they think their //maṭha// will deteriorate, then Prabhupāda has offered...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
...to maintain the temples.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Let their men work. Whatever expenditure is required, we shall give. There is no disturbance. Money is power. That we have got.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
By the grace of...

**Acyutānanda:**
Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja mentioned that before you went to America, Indians were not interested. And now you have come back with money, so they are willing to hear.

**Prabhupāda:**
Money is the strength all over, all over the world. America is prestigious---why? They have got money. So we..., I have got American disciples. Why shall I not have money? If America, a //guru// of the Americans remain poor, it is contradictory.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It cannot be. [break]

**Acyutānanda:**
//...Kṛṣṇa// books, //Gītā, Nectar of Devotion, Īśopaniṣad, Bhāgavatam// volumes.

**Yaśodānandana:**
This //Nectar of Devotion// is a big seller.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Acyutānanda:**
And the science..., Dāmodara Svarūpa's, everyone takes.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Also the //Īśopaniṣad.//

**Prabhupāda:**
What do they say about, after reading?

**Acyutānanda:**
We... Well, we present it that "If anyone doesn't believe in God, you must show this book."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
Or "If you cannot convince another, you must have this book to convince any atheists of the scienctific proof of God." Everybody goes to that. And //Īśopaniṣad,// we say, "If you do not understand if God is a person or not person, read //Īśopaniṣad.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, very good.

**Acyutānanda:**
And then they pick it up. We tease them. And //Nectar of Devotion// also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Science of...

**Acyutānanda:**
Of how to train the mind.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
And...

**Devotee (1):**
//Āgamas.//

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes, and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Practice devotion.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Because it is a thick book which is also not so expensive, people like it very much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Also with color illustrations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now you can give still cheaper, when you print here.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes, that is what we were wondering.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
If when we have...

**Prabhupāda:**
What price you are selling?

**Yaśodānandana:**
Twelve rupees.

**Acyutānanda:**
Twelve rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Twelve rupees. So you can sell, ten rupees, eight rupees.

**Acyutānanda:**
Now the one, when...

**Prabhupāda:**
Still, you keep profit, two, three rupees.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Oh, yes, always. We always make sure of that.

**Acyutānanda:**
When the //Teachings of Lord Caitanya,// small size, came, something happened, but it cost us from the BBT... How much does the //Teachings of Lord Caitanya// cost us?

**Yaśodānandana:**
That's very expensive.

**Acyutānanda:**
It's very expensive.

**Yaśodānandana:**
That's about twenty-two rupees that we have to pay, and we cannot resell it for twenty-eight rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no...

**Acyutānanda:**
Twenty-two rupees, we shall pay.

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall print. It will cost not more than ten to twelve rupees.

**Acyutānanda:**
Must be. Then we'll... Many people will take that. It is also... It is about ninety pages' index, which has increased the volume of the book.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Ninety?

**Acyutānanda:**
Ninety.

**Yaśodānandana:**
In India they don't care for index.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, index is liked by scholarly people.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It will be liked by scholarly men. [end]
