**Prabhupāda:**
//Ānanda.// What you have written? //Nirvṛti// means pleasure.

**Dayānanda:**

[03:11]

Translation: "My Lordship Nṛsiṁha-deva, who can, therefore, stop Your anger? Now my father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, the great demon, being killed, as the saintly persons take pleasure in the killing of the scorpion and the snake..."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the beginning? //Tad yaccha?// Hmm? //Tad yaccha:// "Give up that anger." What you have written?

**Dayānanda:**
It says, "Who can, therefore, stop Your anger?"

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. "Please, therefore, give up Your anger."

**Hṛdayānanda:**
"Please, therefore, give up your anger."

**Dayānanda:** Oh. "Please, therefore, stop your anger. Now my father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, the great demon, being killed, as the saintly persons who take pleasure in the killing of the scorpion and the snake, similarly, all the saintly persons have achieved great satisfaction on account of the demon's death. Now they are confident of their happiness. They shall always remember about Your auspicious incarnation."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Of Nṛsiṁha-deva."

So Prahlāda Mahārāja is requesting Nṛsiṁha-deva, "Now the business is finished. My father, the great demon, Hiraṇyakaśipu..." He said, //asuraś ca hatas...// He... Such a great Vaiṣṇava, he is not calling Hiraṇyakaśipu his father. And in other place also he addressed his father, //na sādhu manye asura-varya// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]. He never said "my father." He said "the greatest of the //asuras.//" He was so bold. The father was such a great demon, and he was not addressing him as father, and the father was becoming more and more angry upon him. This indicates that a person who is a demon, not devotee, he's not worth calling a father. That sort of father should be avoided. //Pitā na sa syāt.// People are affectionate to father and mother, and they hesitate how to give up..., especially boys, give up the company of family, father and mother, take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But here in the //śāstra// it is said, "If the father is demon or a mother is demon or a friend is demon or a family member is demon, they should not be accepted as relative." //Pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syād gurur na sa syāt// [[books:sb:5:5:18|[SB 5.5.18]]]. Even //guru.// If you have accepted somebody as //guru// but he's a demon, he should be rejected immediately. Immediately. Just like in India there is a system of //jāta-guru,// the //guru// by caste. By familywise, they become //guru.// One family is attached to another //guru// family by hereditary rules, the sons, after sons accepting //guru,// the other party, and there is regular business. So such kind of //guru// is not wanted.

Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī has recommended that //laukika-guru...// This is //laukika-guru. Parityāgena adhyātmika paramārthika guru// accepted. //Guru// has to be accepted who is actually //paramārthika,// advanced in spiritual knowledge, not the formality. That is recommended by Jīva Gosvāmī. //Parityāgena. Parityāga vidhīyate. Śāstra// says, "If the //guru// does not know the right thing, he can be given up." So what is the right thing? Right thing is to become devotee. First of all the śāstric injunction is that anyone who is not a devotee, he cannot become //guru.// He cannot become //guru. Avaiṣṇava,// he cannot become //guru.// He must be a Vaiṣṇava. Then he... //Ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. A //brāhmaṇa,// born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, not //brāhmaṇa// but in a //brāhmaṇa// family, or even //brāhmaṇa,// because qualified, //ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇaḥ... Brāhmaṇa// has six kinds of livelihood, //sat-karma. Paṭhana pāṭhana yajana yājana dāna-pratigraha// [[books:sb:5:17:11#id4|[SB 5.17.11 purport]]]. A //brāhmaṇa,// well qualified, he must be a very learned scholar, //paṭhana.// And he must be able to make his disciple also very learned. //Paṭhana pāṭhana.// He must worship the Deity, //yajana yājana.// And he should worship for others also, //yajana yājana. Dāna-pratigraha:// he should accept charity from disciples and others, and again distribute it. //Dāna-pratigraha.// A //brāhmaṇa// is supposed to be..., always remain a beggar. Even if he gets //lakhs// and //lakhs// of rupees, he spends it for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the sign of //brāhmaṇa.// So even such //brāhmaṇa,// if he's not Vaiṣṇava, then he cannot become a //guru. Avaiṣṇava.//

> ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇa-vipro
> mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ
> avaiṣṇavo gurur na sa syāt...
> [Padma Purāṇa]

And //sad-vaiṣṇava śvapaco guruḥ.// If a person is born in the low-grade family and has become a Vaiṣṇava, he becomes //guru.// This is śāstric injunction, and that is the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that "You become a //guru.//" He does not say, "Because you are //brāhmaṇa// or a //kṣatriya,// you become //guru.//" No. "Every one of you, become a //guru.//" How? //Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]: You simply learn the science of Kṛṣṇa and teach it; then you become //guru.//

So because this Hiraṇyakaśipu was not a Vaiṣṇava, so Prahlāda Mahārāja declined to call him, address him, as father. No. This is //pitā na syāt...// "He is not my father." So he is addressing that //tad yaccha manyum:// "Now my Lord, Nṛsiṁha-deva, You have not cause to become angry, because the person upon whom You are so angry, that //asura,// my father, Hiraṇyakaśipu, is now killed. So business is finished." So the question may be that... Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva may ask that "I have killed your father, so your relative may be unhappy. Therefore I'm angry. Why they are angry upon..., they're unhappy? I have killed a demon." So Prahlāda Mahārāja says, "No, no, no. That is not the case. Nobody is unhappy. Nobody is unhappy. By killing my father Hiraṇyakaśipu, I am not unhappy and nobody is unhappy." //Tad yaccha manyum asuraś ca hatas tvayā dayā:// "By You, by Your grace." "So if you are not happy, why?" Now, //modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā:// "Why they should be unhappy? Because the //sādhu,// a saintly person, does not like that anyone should be killed, even an ant." That is //sādhu.// A //sādhu// does not want to kill even an ant. But in the case of //vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā,// they are happy. They are happy. //Vṛścika,// scorpion, and //sarpa.//

So long, long ago, sometimes in the year 1933 in this Caitanya Maṭha, there was a big snake came out in my front. I was taking bath. So everyone was looking what to do. So Guru Mahārāja was on the upstair. He immediately ordered, "Kill him." So it was killed. So at that time, 1933, I was newcomer. So I thought, "How that Guru Mahārāja ordered this snake to be killed?" I was little surprised. But later on, when I saw this verse, I was very glad. //Modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā// [[books:sb:7:9:14|[SB 7.9.14]]]. It remained a doubt, "How Guru Mahārāja ordered a snake to be killed?" But when I read this verse I was very much pleased, that these creatures, or creatures like the snake, they should not be shown any mercy. No. And Cāṇakya Paṇḍita said there are two kinds of cruel creatures. One kind is a //sarpaḥ krūraḥ.// The snake is very cruel. //Sarpaḥ krūraḥ, khalaḥ krūraḥ.// And //khala,// a person who has awakened the quality like snake... Then there is no fault. Why a snake is called so cruel? Because unnecessarily they bite. If somebody commits some offense unto you, if you bite me, that is reasonable. But I have no fault, but you are biting me. The //vṛścika,// scorpion, and snake, they do that, without any offense. A man is passing, an animal is passing---unnecessarily it bites, without offense. A man is sleeping---it bites. Therefore they are very dangerous. Similarly, there are men also like the snake---without any fault they bite. Without any fault. If I do something faulty, you can punish me, bite. But without any fault, if you bite me... So therefore Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, //sarpaḥ krūraḥ-khalaḥ krūraḥ sarpāt krūrataraḥ khalaḥ.// Such person is called //khala,// envious, jealous.

So there are two living creatures. One is snake, and one is jealous or envious person. So Cāṇakya Paṇḍita said, //sarpāt krūrataraḥ khalaḥ:// "This man, envious man, is more dangerous than the snake." Than the snake. Why? He's a human being. Yes, because he's human being and he has got developed consciousness, and he has practiced to use the developed consciousness for becoming jealous, he's more dangerous than the snake. So therefore he concludes, //mantrauśādhi-vaśaḥ sarpaḥ khalaḥ kena nivāryate.// The snake, although by nature he is so..., still, he can be controlled by //mantra// and some herbs. In India they still do that. But this //khalaḥ,// the person jealous, he cannot be pacified any means. Therefore he's more dangerous than the snake. A person who has become jealous and envious, he cannot be controlled either by //mantra// or by bribe or this or that. No. //Sarpāt krūrataraḥ khalaḥ.// So Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "My Lord, nobody is unhappy, even the saintly person. Saintly person... We common man, we may be unhappy---'Oh, my father is killed'---or my mother may be unhappy that 'My husband is killed.' But be sure, my father was a //khalaḥ.// Unnecessarily he was envious of Your Lordship, so he was more dangerous than the snake and the scorpion. Therefore by killing him You have satisfied everyone, even one is saintly person. So there is no question of becoming angry still. By this action everyone is happy, so don't consider any other. You become now pacified." //Tad yaccha manyum asuraś ca hatas tvayādya modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā// [[books:sb:7:9:14|[SB 7.9.14]]].

"But still, may be others, unhappy---may not be your family, because you were also tortured---but others that are killed, such a demon, big, powerful..." So Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //lokāś ca nirvṛtim itaḥ:// "Everyone is satisfied, even the higher planets, the demigods and everyone." //Nirvṛtim itaḥ pratiyanti:// "They are waiting only just to see You pacified." //Sarve rūpaṁ nṛsiṁha.// "But is not this form very fearful to anyone? You may not be afraid of; others?" Prahlāda Mahārāja assures, "No, no. Nobody is fearful. This fearful appearance of Your Lordship is very pleasing to the devotees, because as soon as they are in fearful condition, they will remember Your this Nṛsiṁha form, and they will be out of danger. It is so pleasing." Just like we..., //ito nṛsiṁha, tato nṛsiṁha yato yato yāmi...// So our only shelter is Nṛsiṁha-deva. This world is very, very dangerous. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadam// [SB 10.14.58]. In every step there is danger. Every step there is envious creatures. You cannot live here peacefully. //Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]], Kṛṣṇa says. It is a place simply for suffering, and that also not permanent. You cannot make any comprise, that "All right, it is suffering. That's all right. Still, I shall stay here." No, that is also not possible. //Aśāśvatam.// You have to die. //Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. You cannot solve these problems, miserable condition. Ultimately you have to die.

So people do not understand. Therefore they are called //mūḍhas.// They are simply making arrangement how to become happy. It is not possible to become happy here. That's a fact. But still they are. Therefore they are called //mūḍhas,// rascals. Which will never be possible, and they are trying for that. You see, whole world is trying to be happy. They are discovering so many technological arts, but they are dying. Is it or not? They have invented horseless carriage, having very, I mean to say, speedy carriages, but there are so many dangers. Every moment the life can go, the motor accident. It is happening in the Western country. So whatever you do for the advancement of material civilization, you are one side increasing more danger. If you did not discover these aeroplane and motorcar, then death would not have been so easier. You could live at least for some days. But because you have discovered some facilities, your death is also very..., become near. So this is //prakṛti.// You are trying to solve the problem in one way, and the problem is becoming more dangerous and difficult by the laws of nature. That these rascals cannot find even. They continually working. There is a verse in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, paśyann api na paśyati// [[books:sb:2:1:4|[SB 2.1.4]]]. They are so big rascals that //paśyann api na paśyati:// even they are seeing every moment that "All our endeavors are being baffled," still, they'll try for it. They'll try for it, again and again. //Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]. These things are there. //Punaḥ punaḥ,// again and again, chewing the chewed, this is their business. Therefore they are called //mūḍhas.// The //mūḍhas,// they do not find that "All our attempt..."

Therefore the //śāstra// advises, "You simply make one attempt, how to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise you are not..." Only one thing. That chance you cannot get in other form of life, that a cat, dog, you do not get this. And what is that? //Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]]. By the laws of nature you are getting different types of body in different planets, in different situation and so on, so on, eight million, four hun..., you are loitering in this way, but you could not get Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Now here is the chance, human form of life, and the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is there. Take it seriously. //Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayeteta kovidaḥ.// If you are actually intelligent---//kovido// means very intelligent---then you take. You must. //Kṛṣṇa yei bhaje sei baḍa catura:// "Anyone who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he's first-class intelligent person." All other: fools, rascals. You can call them. There is no harm. They are actually fools and rascal, who has not taken. And it is not our manufactured word. Kṛṣṇa said, //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. Anyone who is not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is rascal, he's sinful, he's lowest of the mankind, he has no knowledge, he's gone to hell. This is our conclusion. Sometimes they come to fight us, that "Sir, you said such a great man 'rascal.' " But we must say, "Yes, he is a rascal. Where is his greatness?" //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. Anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he cannot be a great man. This is our conclusion. There is no question. Immediately, as soon as you see he's against Kṛṣṇa, or he does not know Kṛṣṇa, then he's a rascal, that's all.

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛtajñānā
> āsuri-bhāvam...
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

So this Hiraṇyakaśipu was a great rascal. So he is killed. Nobody is happy. So this is the position. Prahlāda Mahārāja is requesting Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva, "Now everyone is happy, so kindly be peaceful."

Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you.
