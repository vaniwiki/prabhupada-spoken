**Prabhupāda:**
...by //prakṛti,// how intelligently.

**Acyutānanda:**
Even if they can make chemical colors, it's not as nice as the flowers.

**Prabhupāda:**
That... Apart from that, everything... //Sarva-kāma-dugdha-mahī.// From the earth, everything is there. This green color is there, this red color is there, the pink color is there, this white color is there---but you cannot separate. Where is your chemistry? Take the color, the flavor, from the earth. [end]
