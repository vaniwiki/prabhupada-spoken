====== Morning Walk [partially recorded] ======

[low level audio]

**Prabhupāda:**
So anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's //māyayāpahṛta-jñāna// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. He's a [indistinct]. He's madman. Actually everyone is mad. That is the medical report.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Do they give some present? No.

**Kīrtirāja:**
Not some present, but even..., even the policemen, they are stopping the traffic, especially when they see the devotees coming. In Calcutta we saw. We were driving from Germany with Gargamuni Mahārāja in those six vans, and the policemen were especially stopping the traffic so that we could come through. And in New York also, the policemen on the street, they are dancing.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Kīrtirāja:**
When the //saṅkīrtana// party is coming, sometimes they are raising their arms and they are dancing also, because they see that we are..., that this movement is not like the other movements. The others, they are just staying hippies, and now they are... They have some //guru.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] These rascal //gurus...//

**Kīrtirāja:**
Like you said yesterday, they are all rascals.

**Prabhupāda:**
It has been discussed by that professor.

**Dayānanda:**
From France?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dayānanda:**
Yes.

**Kīrtirāja:**
He said they have..., these translations of Aurobindo and Ramakrishna are modernized.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kīrtirāja:**
I think they are modernized and compromised. That's why they are so popular, because you can do whatever you want...

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not popular, not very.

**Kīrtirāja:**
Yeah, and they aren't even popular, no.

**Dayānanda:**
Popular amongst the //mūḍhas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
They are //mūḍhas.// They do not know anything, and they write books.

**Devotee:**
Didn't that Dr. Radhakrishnan go crazy at the end of his life, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kīrtirāja:**
I think you have visited him...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kīrtirāja:**
...and he was not able to even talk.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Kīrtirāja:**
How can that be God? [end]
