Translation: "O my Lord, the supreme eternal, by expansion of Your plenary portion You have created a subtle body, the living entity, through the agency of Your external energy. And thus the living entity becomes entrapped with different varieties of desires through the mind, consisting of unlimited desires to be fulfilled by the Vedic direction of karma-kāṇḍa, fruitive activity, and the sixteen elements. Who is there who can come out of this entanglement without taking shelter at Your lotus feet?"

**Prabhupāda:**

> māyā manaḥ sṛjati karmamayaṁ balīyaḥ
> kālena codita-guṇānumatena puṁsaḥ
> chandomayaṁ yad ajayārpita-ṣoḍaśāraṁ
> saṁsāra-cakram aja ko 'titaret tvad-anyaḥ

This is the description of material existence. So, first thing is, our mind is polluted. The simple statement of a Vaiṣṇava poet,

> kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare
> pāsate māyāra tāre jāpaṭiyā dhāre
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

Actually our position is to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is real position. Caitanya Mahāprabhu starts His instruction from this point, that we are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, and because we have rebelled not to serve, therefore Kṛṣṇa, out of His unlimited mercy and compassion, He comes down and teaches, "You rascal, surrender. Why you are suffering unnecessarily?" //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You rascal, you give up all these so-called engagements. You surrender to Me."

So from this point Caitanya Mahāprabhu starts His instruction. When Sanātana Gosvāmī approached Him, that "By Your mercy I have left my this material engagement. I was minister. I was very much puffed up. So by good fortune I saw You. Now I have retired from my so-called happy life. Now please tell me what is my position?" //Ke āmi kene āmāre jāre tāpa traya:// "Why I am? What I am? Why I am put into this condition of suffering?" Just like one goes to the physician, a diseased man. He submits and inquires from the physician that "Why I am suffering from this pain---some pain always in the heart, some pain in the belly, some pain in head? So what is the disease?" So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "The disease is that you are servant of Kṛṣṇa. You are, rascal, trying to be master of the world." This is the struggle. A servant is trying to become master. How it is possible? It is simply entanglement. Just like in an office, a menial servant, if he wants to imitate the master, he'll be involved in so many difficulties. So that is our position.

So it is possible, because a living entity is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, so he has got the qualities of Kṛṣṇa in very, very minute, fragmental portion. I have several times explained this. Just like a small drop of seawater has got the same chemical composition as the vast seawater. Therefore, if you taste the vast seawater, it is salty, and the drop is also salty because the same chemical composition is there in minute quantity. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is //svatantam. Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ svarāṭ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Svarāṭ. Svarāṭ// means independent. //Bhāgavata// begins that "The origin of everything, the Absolute Truth, is senscient." He's not a chunk. He's senscient. //Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād abhijñaḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Abhijñaḥ// means senscient. He's not a dull matter. But the question is, wherefrom knowledge and sense comes? We have to take senses, learn knowledge, from master, from teacher. But so far Kṛṣṇa is concerned, He is //svarāṭ.// He hasn't got to take any knowledge from anyone. That is Kṛṣṇa's, I mean to say, feature: //svarāṭ. Svarāṭ// means independent. Everything He's independent. He's not dependent. //Nija-lābha-pūrṇaḥ.// The other day we learned, //nija-lābha-pūrṇaḥ.// He is always complete in Himself. He hasn't got...

So when we imitate Kṛṣṇa---we want to be complete in ourself without the help of Kṛṣṇa---this is called //māyā. Māyā// means that we want to imitate Kṛṣṇa. That is going on, material world. Therefore you'll find these Māyāvādīs... [aside:] Who is that? Take him out. The Māyāvādīs, they persist on this point, that "I am God." The //māyā// is working there. //Māyā// is working there still, although he is thinking that "I am now liberated. I have become Nārāyaṇa." //Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. He is thinking that "I am God." That means he is in the darkest region of //māyā,// and still, he is thinking that he's liberated. He is thinking what he's not. At the present moment, you'll find, the whole world is filled up with these rascals. They are in the deepest region of //māyā// and concocting that he is God, he is God. This is //māyā.// Therefore it is said, //māyā manaḥ.// The //māyā manaḥ// is so strong that... //Māyā manaḥ sṛjati karmamayaṁ balīyaḥ.// Very strong. His material existence began from this point, that "Why shall I serve Kṛṣṇa? I shall remain independent." But the rascal does not know that he cannot become independent. That is not possible. But this is the beginning of material life. "Why shall I accept God? I am God." So the same thing is continuing in different phases.

So //māyā manaḥ// is very strong. It is very, very difficult. Therefore we have to voluntarily surrender. It takes very, very long time, //balīyaḥ,// but if one is intelligent, if one is fortunate, he takes immediately. That is the difference. Otherwise it will take many, many births. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. Even if he is //jñānavān,// full knowledge of everything---scientific knowledge, physical, chemical, metaphysical, mathematical, all this knowledge---but denying God, "I am God. There is no need of God. Now we shall do everything. We are advanced in science..." This is called //māyā manaḥ.// These rascals, thinking like that... It will never be possible. //Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo vāyor athāpi manaso muni-puṅgavānām// [Bs. 5.34]. Great, great //muni... Muni// means mental speculators. They're thinking within the mind this, that, this, that, this, that. //Muni-puṅgavānām. Puṅgava. Puṅgava// means very expert mental speculator. Even they think like that for many, many years... //Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara. Koṭi// means hundred //lakhs,// and again multiplied by //sata, sata,// unlimited. //Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo// [Bs. 5.34]. And the speed? //Vāyor athāpi manaso:// speed of the air and the mind. Still, //avicintya-tattve:// they cannot understand what is God. Ask any scientist, any physist, any mathematician. Just like recently one rascal---he is doctor---he has said that "Sītā was sister of Rāma, and Rāma was this and that." So speculator. He has become bigger than the //ācāryas,// and because he has got little doctorate title, he's thinking that he has become very, very big. This is going on. This is called //māyā manaḥ. Māyā// is so strong that she is bewildering even so-called doctorates, [indistinct] and others. All rascals. //Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.// Therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //māyayāpahṛta-jñānā// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. Although they have got these university degrees, but they are rascals. Why? //Māyayapahṛta-jñānā:// their knowledge has been taken away by //māyā.//

//Māyā// is very strong. You have seen the picture of Māyā, Durgādevī, and the Mahiṣāsura is fighting, very strong, just like Hiraṇyakaśipu. There are many //asuras.// So Mahiṣa... Sometimes Kṛṣṇa Himself comes to kill the //asura,// or sometimes His agent, Māyā, Durgādevī, kills. You have seen the picture of Goddess Kālī. She is killing simply the //asuras,// chopping one after another, one after another, one after... //Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā// [Bs. 5.44]. She can create, she can maintain, and she can make //pralaya,// devastator. That is her business. But so powerful, still she is under the control of the Supreme Lord. Therefore here it is said, //saṁsāra-cakram aja ko 'titaret tvad-anyaḥ:// "A strong //māyā.// I cannot get out of her clutches." So Prahlāda Mahārāja knows it. //Ko 'titaret:// "Who can surpass? Who can get rid of this clutches of //māyā?//" //Tvad-anyaḥ.// That is the fact.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that "You surrender to Me, and you'll be free from //māyā.//" //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ sara..., ahaṁ tvām// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "I'll give you protection." //Mām eva ye prapadyante// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. The same thing, whole instruction, is there. Simply if we want to be happy... Happiness you cannot have in this way, by concocting plans. That is not possible. You have seen the whole world, especially in the modern days, so many big, big nations, they are assembled together in the United Nation. Nonsense, where is the unity? Simply disunity. For the last twenty or thirty years they are struggling. Before that, they convened another, League of Nation. So they are making simply plans. And it continues for some time. Then, after fifteen or twenty years, again conflagration of war, especially in the Europe. They're all demons. How the demons can bring in peace by so-called United Nation or League of Nation? That is not possible. They have to give up the demonic activities. They have to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then they will be saved.

So we are just trying to introduce the real civilization. Actually, there is no civilization at the present moment. They are simply cats and dogs and fighting one another. There is no civilization. This is not civilization. Atheists, demons, they are predominating. And because they have got big, big skyscraper building and many motorcars, India has become victimized: "Oh, without this motorcar and without this skyscraper building, we are condemned." So they are trying to imitate. They have forgotten their own culture, the best culture, Vedic culture. So it is the first time that we are trying to conquer over the demonic culture with this Vedic culture. This is the first time. So it is very pleasing that you have joined this movement. If you want to make the human society happy, give them this culture of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is being described by Prahlāda Mahārāja, that //saṁsāra-cakra.// If you become involved in this demonic culture, then the //saṁsāra-cakra,// the wheel of repetition of birth and death, will go on. You cannot stop it. It is not possible. But if you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then there is possibility. This is the purport of this verse.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
