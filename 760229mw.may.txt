**Prabhupāda:**
Lakṣmī should be engaged in the service of Nārāyaṇa. At the present moment, Lakṣmī is under the clutches of Rāvaṇa, //rākṣasa.// So it should be delivered, Hanumān. So I am trying for that purpose, to deliver Sītā from the clutches of Rāvaṇa. That is my mission.

**Kīrtirāja:**
You are succeeding also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rāvaṇa-class man wants only Sītā, not Rāma. Rāma, they are condemning, these rascals, Suniti Chatterjee and others. But our mission is to keep Rāma and Sītā together. We are not satisfied that Rāma should remain alone and Sītā should be under the custody of Rāvaṇa. We can't... I don't want. Sītā must be released from the custody of Rāvaṇa. [break] ...with opulence means we are bringing Sītā nearer, nearer, nearer. That is wanted. Otherwise, for a //sannyāsī,// what is the use of these big buildings? No. We want these big buildings for service of Rāma. [break].

**Devotee (1):**
...Prabhupāda, in the material world for motivating a person to collect //lakṣmī,// but this has to be the most beautiful point I ever heard.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the real point. All other points besides this, they are Rāvaṇa's point. [break] ...adjust things, taking Sītā from the clutches of one Rāvaṇa to the another Rāvaṇa. The material... At the present moment... Just like the Communist, they are trying to take away money from the capitalists. So this process is taking Sītā from clutches of Rāvaṇa, and it goes to another Rāvaṇa. Because both of them are Rāvaṇa, so there is no meaning to it. There will be no benefit. It has failed already. The Communist movement, it is simply now lordism. Just like there are many rogues and dacoits, they plunder money and sometimes give to the poor. So this is another edition of the same thing: one Rāvaṇa to another Rāvaṇa. Just like Ramakrishna Mission---//daridra-nārāyaṇa//---theory only. And that is also not perfect. It cannot be perfect. Communist theory is to take the money from the capitalists and distribute it to the poor, to the mass people.

**Kīrtirāja:**
But I have seen that they are not even distributing it to the poor.

**Prabhupāda:**
That cannot be...

**Kīrtirāja:**
There is no food. And there is even nothing to eat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kīrtirāja:**
Nothing to eat...

**Prabhupāda:**
Nothing to receive.

**Kīrtirāja:**
...no flowers. So they are not even distributing it.

**Prabhupāda:**
So in Poland there is no fruit, flower, eh?

**Kīrtirāja:**
Flowers are almost one dollar for one carnation. Fruit, I... The only fruit I have seen is apples. Oranges are very expensive, and that is all.

**Prabhupāda:**
Apples and that strawberry. In Russia, I have seen only strawberry. That's all. No..., no other fruit. Fruit means strawberry. These rascals do not see that they are being punished by nature.

**Hari-śauri:**
Their idea is that the more the struggle goes on, the better, the more glorified they are.

**Prabhupāda:**
And therefore it is called "ass." [laughter] Ass works very hard, and he thinks, "I am glorified." //Mūḍha.// Therefore they are called //mūḍha. Ugra-karma.//

**Kīrtirāja:**
I have seen driving from Germany that even sometimes they don't have an animal ass. They become the ass, and they are carrying the big load on their back, almost on four legs, it is so heavy. [end]
