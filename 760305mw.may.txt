**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...for getting a big display inside. And I got him to agree to only seventeen point five percent commission, which is very reasonable.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. Let them send. [break] ...is compared with a rose flower without flavor. Man with education is compared with the //kokila// [cuckoo bird]. //Kokilānāṁ svaro rūpam.// The bird, //kokila,// is very black, but his sound, sweet, so sweet, everyone likes. //Kokilānām svaro-rūpaṁ vidyā-rūpaṁ ku-rūpanam, nārī-rūpaṁ pati-vrataḥ.// And woman's beauty is how she is chaste and devoted to the husband. That is beauty, not personal beauty. //Vidyā-rūpaṁ ku-rūpanam.// And education is the beauty for the brain. And the beauty of the //kokila// is her sweet voice. //Kṣamā-rūpaṁ tapasvinaḥ.// And those who are saintly person, they should be simply forgiving. That is their beauty.

**Haṁsadūta:**
For giving?

**Pusta Kṛṣṇa:**
Forgiving.

**Prabhupāda:**
Forgiving. //Kṣamā-rūpaṁ tapasvinaḥ.// Did Christ said that "Father, they did not know..."?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yeah. "Forgive them, for they know not what they do." "Forgive them for they know not..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see how much forgiving. This is saintly character. They're killing, and still forgiving. //Kṣamā-rūpaṁ tapasvinaḥ.// Christ is very ideal character, but these Christians, they... Not dignified him---degraded. So you can get on?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...how to respect food grain. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone should understand, "This food grain is supplied by Kṛṣṇa for our living. How can I disrespect?" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore we say //prasāda-sevā,// not "//prasāda// eating." //Prasāda-sevā. Prasāda// should be accepted as Kṛṣṇa. And our eating means to serve Kṛṣṇa. "Kṛṣṇa has given. Eat them. Yes." That's all.

> kṛṣṇa baḍa dayāmaya, karibāre jihvā jaya
> sva-prasāda-anna dila bhāi
> sei prasāda-annāmṛta khāo, rādhā-kṛṣṇa-guṇa gāo

And at the same time one should chant: "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is so kind. We are hungry, we are so greedy, and He has given so nice //prasādam.//" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Pusta Kṛṣṇa:**
Sometimes we have difficulty discriminating where the enjoying spirit stops and where the service spirit begins, especially when we take //prasādam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you should remember it is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Then it is all right. Actually, everything is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Without Kṛṣṇa's mercy you cannot live even for a moment. You should always remember. //Kṛṣṇa bado dayāmaya.// That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Kṛṣṇa badā dayāmaya karibāre jihvā jāya, sva-prasāda-anna dila bhāi.//

**Hari-śauri:**
So if one cooks according to one's own tastes and then offers it to the Deity, that is not so good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you have to learn this now?

**Hari-śauri:**
No, I'm just parodying.

**Pusta Kṛṣṇa:**
So is it that everything we do, are we trying to make some mental adjustment, that "We're taking //prasādam...//"?

**Prabhupāda:**
Mental adjustment is nonsense. No mental. Actual. Mental adjustment is material. You have to follow the orders of superior. There is no question of mental adjustment. [break] You get all your necessities of life from the earth. Now, you get food, you get drinking water, you get shelter, bamboo. These things will... You get cotton. So what is that slogan? //Kaparā...?//

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Roṭi kaparā makān.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, everything, yes. //Roṭi// is there, //kaparā// is there, and //makān// is there. And wherefrom it is coming? //Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. From earth. Why you are after factories? The mother earth is giving you everything. Therefore he's called mother. Seven mothers. One of the mothers is this earth. //Dhenu dhātrī tathā pṛthvi sapteti mātari smṛtāḥ. Dhenu// means cow, and //dhātrī// means nurse. //Tathā pṛthvi. Pṛthvi// means this land. So they are taking care of the land, Nationalists, and killing the other mother, //dhenu.// A rascal civilization. If you are taking care of mother, you must take care of all mothers. No, they are mad after the land, but killing the other mother, //dhenu.// This is called rascaldom. [break] ...to give all comforts to the human brother, and they are sending the animal brother to slaughterhouse. What is this Communist? If you are Communist, if you are equal to all your brothers, why you should discriminate? And our communism is that even there is a snake in your home, you must see that he is not starving. This is spiritual communism. Nobody likes snake. Everyone kills. But //śāstra// says, "Even a snake is there at your home, you must see that he's not starving." This is communism, perfect. [aside:] What are these he is collecting?

**Devotee:**
Eggplant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eggplant? [break] Not of the sun but of the mist, one who is driving away, "Get out!" Now, just see. He is becoming pure. //Yāhāṇ kṛṣṇa tāhāṇ nāhi māyāra adhikāra// [[books:cc:madhya:22:31|[Cc. Madhya 22.31]]]. Immediately there is Kṛṣṇa, there is no more //māyā.// [end]
