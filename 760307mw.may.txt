====== Morning Walk ======

**Hṛdāyānanda:**
...puffed up with knowledge.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is their knowledge, nonsense? He has knowl...? Have they knowledge?

**Bhagavān:**
They're trying to prove that sense gratification is bona fide.

**Guru-kṛpā:**
And the explanation of...

**Prabhupāda:**
And where is sense gratification? As soon as nature kicks you out, where is your sense gratification?

**Hṛdāyānanda:**
It's a relative thing. Actually, compared to the ordinary man, he's much more intelligent.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is intelligence?

**Hṛdāyānanda:**
He's thinking that "I know so many things, and these other people, they don't know these things. Therefore I'm better than them."

**Prabhupāda:**
So the birds and beasts, they know better than you many things. There are many birds and beasts.

**Guru-kṛpā:**
"They can't... They can't explain it."

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Guru-kṛpā:**
"They can't explain it."

**Prabhupāda:**
You also cannot explain. What is explaining? All nonsense.

**Guru-kṛpā:**
"Well, I can explain."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Perhaps." "Might be." "It was like this and that..." What is that explanation?

**Guru-kṛpā:**
Well, the common man doesn't challenge that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mean common men are fool. But why we should accept?

**Bhagavān:**
If they could really explain it, so many things would not be going wrong.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhagavān:**
If they could actually explain it, so many things would not be going wrong. The thing is, their explanation causes more problems.

**Satsvarūpa:**
But they say that... When we say that everything is done by Kṛṣṇa, they say that's also "perhaps," "maybe." They don't see...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we have got evidence. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. We have got evidence.

**Satsvarūpa:**
As we don't accept theirs, they don't accept ours.

**Prabhupāda:**
You don't accept... You don't... Why shall I accept you? You don't accept me; I don't accept you. Why you become authority?

**Guru-kṛpā:**
Then they say "Finished. Get out."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, my question is that "Why they become atheists, a little knowledge, so-called scientists?"

**Madhudviṣa:**
They have to become atheists.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Madhudviṣa:**
They have to become atheist. If they don't become atheists, then they can't play their games anymore. The idea of their research finishes as soon as you admit that there is God. But if you say, "There's no God," then they can research. It was explained that...

**Prabhupāda:**
They can continue to befool you, that, and take money. And as soon as you don't give them money, there is no research. Then they starve.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
We've seen, though, from examples in the Vedic literatures like Viśvakarma and Āyur-vedic medicine, that it's possible to engage in architecture, medicine, such activities, without being atheistic. So it must not simply be that they're scientists, but that they're actually...

**Bhagavān:**
Demons.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Demons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
//Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritaḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]].

**Yaśodānandana:**
The actual motive is to fill the belly.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Moghāśā mogha-karmanaḥ// [[books:bg:9:12|[Bg. 9.12]]].

**Bhagavān:**
Actually, they're envious, because they say that "There is no Supreme Person controlling," but then, on the other hand, they want to become the supreme person controlling.

**Prabhupāda:**
They cannot.

**Bhagavān:**
So it's just a matter of envy.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Who was that demon? He got some benediction from Lord Śiva. Anyone he touched, his head would fall off, but he wanted to use it against Lord Śiva. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
When one is jealous of God, then gradually jealous of everyone.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Jealousy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Jealousy, yes.

**Siddha-svarūpānanda:**
So then if I'm jealous of others, it's really just a reflection of my jealousy of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Siddha-svarūpānanda:**
And if I am angry at others, it's because I'm angry at Kṛṣṇa also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything begins from Kṛṣṇa. //Mattaḥ sarvam pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. Where is your other friend? Oh, here he is!

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śiva-jvara.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. [break] "//Jaya// Prabhupāda. //Haribol.//" [laughs] They'll not touch unless I give, and they are satisfied, even one grain. That is... They don't want more, that "Give me more." No. But constantly. [laughs at child] [break] Make folded hand. Yes. Sometimes he'll press like that, eh, to show me that I am done. They make quick friends with old men. [laughter] [break] ...a few //katias//[?], that is very easy. You assort the //katias.// You go any place, daytime. And nighttime, take a //katia// and spread anywhere, and you can sleep. Indian system.

**Jayapatāka:**
Cot.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cot. Mass of cot.

**Jayapatāka:**
With rope.

**Prabhupāda:**
With rope. That's all. Small. You can keep fifty, sixty. So keep it in one place. And at night take one, and anywhere you can sleep. Very easy. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Children:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda!

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// [break] //...ṣata-doltena malenatvaṁ na muñcyati.//[?] If you take a coal and wash it, one who has... Still black.

**Jayapatāka:**
And he does not allow himself to be washed. He never comes to the temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. If he... A coal, however you go on with soap and other things, go on washing, it will never become clean. //Aṅgarasya śata-doltena malenatvaṁ na muñcyati.//[?] What is the defect? Why the...? The window is becoming black.

**Jayapatāka:**
The lids are... We purchased some new lids yesterday. The lids have been damaged. Therefore the smoke is leaking.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why damage cannot be repaired?

**Jayapatāka:**
No, we purchased yesterday. They're going to install today. [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
...has painted for your books, so he must be fairly good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. If he has painted for my books, then he should be first class.

**Jayapatāka:**
He says he'll finish the one painting in five days.

**Prabhupāda:**
It doesn't matter they take five days or ten days. It must be done very nice. [break] [young children yelling] Hmm. That's nice. [break]

**Madhudviṣa:**
...attached to his hair. He will give it up if you tell him. [break].

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he has to voluntarily do it. [to children:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [end]
