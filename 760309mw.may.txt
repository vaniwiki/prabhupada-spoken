**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] You are being plundered. They are very expert in the plunder. But I thought, "Some Indians will help. He is also 'big belly,' you. It is simply in my eyes. I am the only fool." I criticize like that. Just see how much money they have taken. One day, they are charging ten rupees, and fifty men working, so all spoiled. This is going on all over. //Baro baro badare, baro baro pet, lanka dingake mata kare het.// Hmm? [break] [Bengali] He did not take the card?

**Jayapatāka:**
[mis-hearing "car"] I took a jeep also.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Jayapatāka:**
The card. I got your passbook and deposit book.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Baro baro pet.// How you are being looted. Just see. Farce. They are making farce and taking money.

**Jayapatāka:**
Who?

**Prabhupāda:**
These rascals. Don't you see?

**Jayapatāka:**
This was done since I left.

**Prabhupāda:**
I told that this is being farce, and somebody told me you have guaranteed. And the other day when I was walking, I said, "This is going to be farce," and somebody told me, "They have guaranteed." Eh?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Around the //kuṇḍa,// around the tank, putting up there, //paṇḍāl.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The same man?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Jayapatāka?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayapatāka Mahārāja. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...fifty-seven, fifty-eight years

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Almost sixty years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sixty years, they could not do any of these books. And still they are envious. Within sixty years they could not attract any foreign student or any book published. And still, they are proud. They have got all the blessings of Bhaktisiddhānta.

**Yaśodānandana:**
They cannot even attract Indian students.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see, how black snakes they are.

**Yaśodānandana:**
They do pretty good with old widows, however. [laughter]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Getting a lot of flowers here, it seems.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There must be always all full of flowers.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very many flowers coming.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are maintaining big, big monkey. No //mata het.// That...

**Jayapatāka:**
Maintaining.

**Prabhupāda:**
That...

**Jayapatāka:**
Maintaining Hanumān.

**Prabhupāda:**
What they are doing?

**Jayapatāka:**
Well, they are feeling... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...if there is water. And if there is low land, the whole water will go to the low land. And that means you have two or three canals, there will be no more flood.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So you need the land to make the canals.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Emergency //yajña.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You convince him like that.

**Yaśodānandana:**
This is very clever.

**Prabhupāda:**
And factually we have to do that in order to check the flood. Make scheme like Europeans and Americans. Why you are thinking in terms of Indian plan?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's been here a long time, Prabhupāda. [laughter] He's thinking like a...

**Prabhupāda:**
But I am born here. I have no Indian plan. My plans are all American.

**Yaśodānandana:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda!

**Guru-krpa:**
Your plans are Kṛṣṇa's plans, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Yes. I planned that "I must go to America." Yes. That was the reason. Otherwise, generally they go to London. I did not go to London.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We were talking about that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We were just talking about that last night, that generally someone in India would think, "Let me go to London," but you thought, "Let me go to..."

**Prabhupāda:**
No. I was simply dreaming, "How to go to New York?" Actually I thought.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The biggest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I was scheming, "Whether I shall go this way, through Tokyo, Japan, or that way? Which way is cheaper?" That was my plan. And I was targeting to New York always. Sometimes I was dreaming that I have come to New York. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [Bengali with Indian man] We cannot accept food from the demons. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...supplied at least nice food. [break] You are the first time here?

**Indian man (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
How do you like?

**Indian man (1):**
Very nice. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...purify the whole atmosphere. [break] ...world we are all condemned. Still, Kṛṣṇa has given so many facilities. There is a Bengali proverb, //Bonedhīr astekur bhaga.//[?] means the place of garbage. If a aristocrat asks that "You have to live in my garbage place," "Oh, that is also better." Similarly, Kṛṣṇa... This is garbage. This material world is garbage. And still, we live so comfortably. Now just imagine what is His //dhāma.// It is the garbage tank, still so nice. And just think what is His real place, Goloka Vṛndāvana. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...gave us a very good record, very clean.

**Prabhupāda:**
Purest in the world.

**Jayapatāka:**
Officially, he said, the government is very eager to always keep an eye on your activities, but so far, you have not had any bad record. Therefore the government is favorable.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Otherwise, how Indira Gandhi could see me? Even in the midst of crisis she gave me time. She has got very impression. She said that "I have all faith in you, but because I am afraid of these Americans..."

**Jayapatāka:**
We understand how important it is to keep all our dealings in the open.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes, yes. Very, very careful.

**Jayapatāka:**
Watching the dangers.

**Prabhupāda:**
We have got good reputation all over the world. The German rascals, they wanted to minimize our value, but he failed, that police officer.

**Haṁsadūta:**
If the government sanctions for acquiring this land, then we won't have any trouble in Hyderabad getting that land either.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Have to give it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...take it rightly. Then we'll lay down the foundation. Something; anything.

**Madhudviṣa:**
The subjects that we're going to be discussing today in the GBC meeting is about the role of //sannyāsī// and //brahmacārī// and //gṛhastha// in ISKCON. And in the Eighteenth Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā,// in one of your purports, you say that a //sannyāsī// should never discourage a young man from becoming..., from getting married. But on the other hand, we have understood that a //sannyāsī// should encourage young men to remain //brahmacārī.// So it seems to me like there's some kind of a...

**Prabhupāda:**
According to time, circumstances. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, //niyataṁ kuru karma tvam// [[books:bg:3:8|[Bg. 3.8]]]: "Always be engaged in your prescribed work." And at last He says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Now we have to adjust. That is not contradiction; that is suitable to the time and circumstance. //Karma// is also recommended in the //Vedas, karma-kāṇḍa.// There are three divisions: //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kaṇḍa// and //upāsanā-kāṇḍa. Trayi.// Therefore //Veda// is known as..., what is called? Trio. The "trio" word has come from //trayi.//

**Madhudviṣa:**
You have also said, regarding that, that Kṛṣṇa gives us the conclusion of those three processes in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that //karma// is concluded, //yat karoṣi yad aśnāsi// [[books:bg:9:27|[Bg. 9.27]]], and //jñāna// is concluded //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]], and //yoga// is concluded //yoginām api sarveṣām// [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]. So is there some conclusive..., like Kṛṣṇa says, concluding, //sarva-dharmān parityajya.// Is there some conc...?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the real end. You have to become the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. Either you go through //karma// or //jñāna// or //yoga,// it doesn't matter. The ultimate aim is how to reach Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. [break] Arjuna achieved the favor of Kṛṣṇa by fighting, by killing. [aside to children:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
