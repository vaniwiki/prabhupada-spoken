**Prabhupāda:**
...clean. That also we sometimes neglect. [break] ...means //rūpena jāyate iti prajā.// Everything which is born, that is //prajā.// [break] ...children, our grandmother used to engage us for watering work, these pots. And that water was brought from down, two, three stories down, and we used to bring and put. That is good exercise, and sport also, competition between children. [break] //...karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ// [[books:bg:3:8|[Bg. 3.8]]]. Everyone should be engaged. That is supervision. [break] ...are also engaged in serving Kṛṣṇa. They give flower, and they're offering: "Take this flower. Offer to Kṛṣṇa." This is service, dedicating. This is explained by Kṛṣṇa to Balarāma while going through the Vṛndāvana forest, that "Just see how the trees are welcoming You, how the birds..." You have got that picture?

**Hrdayananda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa is seeing that, how everyone is ready to serve. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa-//bhakta// also sees how everyone is eager to serve Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...engage them rightly, that is leadership. Yes. Otherwise, //andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. As a blind leader is leading other blind men, this whole world is going on like that. They do not know how to properly lead the people. Misleaders. [break] ...grains, cows, all they should be very properly taken care of and the products offered to Kṛṣṇa. Everyone should be engaged as Kṛṣṇa's servant. That is Vṛndāvana. In Vṛndāvana everyone is engaged how to please Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana. [break] ...business to study //Vedānta.// In Vṛndāvana life we see they were not interested to know what is Brahman. [chuckles] They were interested how to please Kṛṣṇa, how to see Kṛṣṇa smiling. That is Vṛndāvana. Huh? Is it not? From Vṛndāvana picture you see they are simply busy to see how Kṛṣṇa is smiling. They didn't care for studying. What they will study? They were all village girls born in the ordinary class, and they did not know. [break] That is the... //Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [Nārada Pañcarātra]: "If Kṛṣṇa is served, then where is the necessity of //tapasya?//" No more //tapasya. Tapasya// is meant for the third-grade men to come to the stage of serving Kṛṣṇa. And one who is, with heart and soul, is serving Kṛṣṇa, he has finished all //tapasya. Tepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur ārya// [[books:sb:3:33:7|[SB 3.33.7]]]. They have already finished all this //tapasya.// Therefore they have come to this stage. //Kṛta-punya-punjaḥ// [[books:sb:10:12:7-11|[SB 10.12.11]]]. What is called? Piling.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Heaps of pious activities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, heaps of, yes. [break] ...Mahāprabhu, He immediately gives how to love and serve Kṛṣṇa. Because this Kali-yuga, they will not be able to follow the regulative principles and become elevated. So He is therefore //mahā-vadānyāya.// He is giving a process---immediately, if followed, he becomes a lover of Kṛṣṇa and His service, immediately. //Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...circumambulating you, Prabhupāda, paying respects.

**Prabhupāda:**
Of course, their vision, //mahā-bhāgavata.// [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [laughs] That is very beautiful.

**Revatīnandana:**
You mean the music?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. That black.

**Revatīnandana:**
Yes, it's very nice. He has blue eyes and big black body.

**Devotee:**
Blue eyes?

**Revatīnandana:**
Yes. It's amazing. If you look closely you will see...

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
The //gopīs,// they didn't like very much being instructed by Uddhava?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. That was dry for them. They asked Uddhava, "Bring Kṛṣṇa. We don't want you any more..." [break] What is his name? That...? Tapomaya. Tapa... He never sees whether it is watered. He is in charge of agricultural department? Where is Jayapatāka? He never sees. One man should be in charge to see things are being done. [break]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Each... What was that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Each flat.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Each floor?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, each floor. Yes. But Tapomaya, he does not see even that the water is... He is in charge of agriculture?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Similarly, it can be understood how he is seeing, he is managing. He does not see.

**Jayapatāka:**
Right now we only have about four or five men here that are managing everything. He is also purchasing all the things for the festival. The GBCs have been requested to give some men...

**Prabhupāda:**
That means he has no time. Then why he says that "I am in charge." He is not in charge.

**Jayapatāka:**
He's assigned to... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
After all, they are boys. They are not grown up. [break] ...your Calcutta program?

**Jayapatāka:**
They're going tomorrow morning. [break]

**Bhavānanda:**
//...maṭha,// and then we went to Mādhava Mahārāja's //maṭha.// So Acyutānanda gave a very strong lecture at Mādhava Mahārāja's //maṭha// that in order to make devotees who are chanting the holy name, it takes more than any material calculation or business sense; that you have be infused with the potency of the Supreme Lord. All of the //sannyāsīs// and //brahmacārīs// were standing out on the balcony and hearing Acyutānanda glorify Your Divine Grace. All the devotees went in. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...small card. So one card is put into the shoes, and one card is in his hand. That's all. Number. Suppose twenty shoes, duplicate, so one twenty card is put into the shoe and one number twenty in his hand. So a man can see that it is his shoe.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Instead of requesting ten //paisā,// they may be requested to offer something to the Deity.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why? Nothing. Let them come and see. That's all. [break]

**Yaśodānandana:**
Our Deity is not beggar.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. He is bestower. He gives everything. If anyone voluntary gives, that's all right. You should not ask to give Him. [break] ...instead of doing this. [Bengali] He said like that. "By showing the Deity to earn livelihood is condemned. Better become a sweeper, municipal sweeper, and sweep the road and earn money." He said like that. That is better, honorable. He is working and getting money, instead of making a good show of Deity and earn money. This is not required. If you want to earn money, go, work according to your capacity and earn money. Don't cheat people. That is Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
There was a big fight, or difference of opinion, wasn't there?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
There was trouble in Navadvīpa, wasn't there, when he advised the pilgrims not to pay money to go into the temples?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He was fight against it. All, Navadvīpa, Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana is not so... But still, they have got rate[?]. One thing, it is a question of heart, that a man should come and visit the temple---he must give something. Why he is to be asked? Voluntarily he should give that.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Yes. We were reading in //Nectar of Devotion// this morning. Your Divine Grace is writing that it is customary in India that whenever one visits the Deity or a saintly person to offer something, even one grain of rice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is the system.

**Lokanātha:**
But encouraging is not recommended?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? What is that encouraging?

**Yaśodānandana:**
Requesting should not be done.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Yaśodānandana:**
It is voluntary.

**Prabhupāda:**
Encouraging means your behavior should be so nice that he voluntarily gives. That is encouraging. Not that begging and "Put something here. My belly is empty." [laughter] [break] ...that is nice, that "Here is an institution. You kindly become a member. Help us." That is another thing. But why should you earn by showing the Deity? You work so nicely they will become voluntarily member, contributing. That is nice. But not that "Now we have got Deity. He's starving. Please give me something." No. That is not good prac...

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
You showed the example when you came to New York. You were cooking //cāpāṭis// and everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Otherwise, who would cook at that time? [break] ...apartment. So I was cooking, and he liked. He thought that "Without any payment, I have got a cook."

**Revatīnandana:**
Dharmadhyaksa dāsa used to be one of his disciples before he joined your..., he became your disciple. And he said that he was talking to Dr. Mishra, and Dr. Mishra still talks about your cooking. He said, "Oh, Swāmījī, he saved my life," he said. "He taught me how to eat properly." He still talks about you. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...improved his health. He says still?

**Revatīnandana:**
Yes. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Revatīnandana:**
Dharma was telling me. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...to rise early in the morning and do whatever is needed. Then at nine, half-past nine, I will go to his apartment and begin cooking. Then, after finishing, I'll take my bathing, and then we shall eat together. And then, after eating, I will go to the Fifth Avenue for loitering.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Fifth Avenue.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So I was cooking once only, that's all.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Your loitering was very fruitful eventually.

**Prabhupāda:**
I was studying Americans, how they are walking, how they are shopping, like that.

**Satsvarūpa:**
One time you said you were happier then, maintaining yourself, than having thousands of disciples.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There was no chance of finding fault. [laughter] Now I have to find fault. [break]

**Madhudviṣa:**
...New York now named Jaya Nimāi Nitāi. When you were first in New York, he was a musician; he used to write music. And he used to get inspired by looking down from his apartment down to the street. And every day he said he used to see this little Indian man walking by, and it was you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And he couldn't figure out what was going on, this man walking by on the street every day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I was having morning walk regularly, alone.

**Madhudviṣa:**
He said you used to walk very fast. [break] [//shenai// band playing] Entrance? [break]

**Rādhāvallabha:**
...ISKCON temples, ISKCON activities, ISKCON temples, ISKCON Deities...

**Prabhupāda:**
How people will know there is exhibition? There is no signboard. Who will know that here is...?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
We'll have to put up signs today showing the entrance. There will also be a BBT and the scholars' quotes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is this?

**Rāmeśvara:**
That is near Atlanta.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. [break] ...He taught them to steal them: "Mother is not giving. You steal." That picture is going on. [break] ...is so small?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Yes, we should have made it bigger. We should have made it much bigger.

**Rāmeśvara:**
The size of the cart is restricted.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
What year is that?

**Rāmeśvara:**
Recently.

**Revatīnandana:**
It was this past year or the year before last when we had it. Two years ago it was full.

**Prabhupāda:**
They want to stop it. That is their... [break] A new temple?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Old temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Who was talking about casting?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
That was in Australia, Adelaide. Cittahārī.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is very nice. This //mūrti// should be standard.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Geneva.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes... No, anywhere.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, and [indistinct] like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are casting. [break] ...this time.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Revatīnandana:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, would it be good to have these titles in Bengali as well as English---the titles on the pictures?

**Gurukṛpā:**
They'll understand. Always one or two guys will explain to the crowd.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they will understand. [break]

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Some of the Bengalis saw this picture yesterday, and they were very surprised.

**Prabhupāda:**
There were some Bengalis?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Just a few were coming through while we were putting the display up. They were very much astonished that we have such a big building. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...light arrangement?

**Rāmeśvara:**
We're going to put lights up today, fluorescent lights.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
There's a wire run through the middle of the...

**Rāmeśvara:**
This is about one half the display, right?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
One half.

**Rāmeśvara:**
The other half is...

**Prabhupāda:**
We can make all these pictures into album that can be sold.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
What is it?

**Rāmeśvara:**
Prabhupāda said we can make a photo album of all these pictures. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...ISKCON temples all over the world.

**Rāmeśvara:**
You told us to make one book also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Little description and...

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
That would be very good for preaching.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Rāmeśvara:**
With our equipment, we can make these photos in any size.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. So do it. [break] ...Auckland?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Madhudviṣa?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Is the same house in Auckland, New Zealand?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Gribblehurst Road.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where I went?

**Rāmeśvara:**
Yes, I can see it. Gribblehurst Road. Same house. This is the old temple in Houston. They're buying a new one.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Boston. Oh, it is very nice.

**Rāmeśvara:**
This is one of the best neighborhoods in all of Boston.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are framework or brick?

**Satsvarūpa:**
It's called brownstone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, brown... Stone it is. That is nice. [break] ...new temple? No.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
That's Ottawa, Canada.

**Prabhupāda:**
Canada.

**Rāmeśvara:**
That is the capital city of Canada.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Johannesburg. That is wonderful. [break] Stockholm, yes.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
People will wonder when they see all these pictures. You are in half of them.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, he's in all of them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Virginia. Here I did not go.

**Rāmeśvara:**
It's near Washington, D.C.

**Prabhupāda:**
Baltimore.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The new Miami temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, very nice.

**Satsvarūpa:**
There are ten acres. That's just a tiny bit.

**Rāmeśvara:**
They have nice mango trees?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Oh, yes, they have many, many---a whole orchard with irrigation pipes.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
This sign on the door of the Tokyo temple says "Hare Kṛṣṇa Temple."

**Prabhupāda:**
So make arrangement that people may come. They should be given direction. Otherwise how they will know there is such thing?

**Hari-śauri:**
Mexico.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
This is only half of the temple pictures. The other half will go up today.

**Rāmeśvara:**
And all the professor quotes will be up by tomorrow morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Rāmeśvara:**
They'll fill the entire wall on the other side.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do to your best capacity and Kṛṣṇa will help.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
There should be some border over here so that people don't accidentally fall into the bottom. Really. We have all kinds of kids coming around. [end]
