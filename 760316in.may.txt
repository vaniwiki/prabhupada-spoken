**Prabhupāda:**
The //mantra,//

> namaḥ apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bahyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ
> [Garuḍa Purāṇa]

So this purificatory process... According to Vedic system, there is purificatory process. //Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ:// "By birth everyone is born a //śūdra.//" A //śūdra// means without any knowledge and simply full of lamentation. //Śocati.// So the Vedic process is that from the low-grade position, to bring the human society to the highest, topmost position. Generally it is... The first, topmost position is to become a //brāhmaṇa// in the society. //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. Four divisions of the social system are there, according to quality and work. That is very natural in this world. Everyone is accepted on quality and work. If you have got a qualification of a good lawyer and if you have done very nicely your activities, then you are selected as the high-court judge. The high-court judge is selected amongst the lawyers in the court. It is not appointed from outside. The... A lawyer who has done his legal profession very nicely, the government offers him the post, that "You become a high-court judge."

So this quality and work is estimated everywhere and in all circumstances. So //Bhagavad-gītā// recommends---Kṛṣṇa says personally, the Supreme Personality of Godhead---//cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. So that process is applicable at all times. And Nārada Muni, he also gave description to Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja while they were talking about the //varṇāśrama.// So Nārada Muni gave different symptoms of different //varṇa: brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// Then, at the conclusion, he said,

> yasya hi yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ
> varṇābhivyañjakam
> yady anyatrāpi dṛśyeta
> tat tenaiva vinirdiśet
> [[books:sb:7:11:35|[SB 7.11.35]]]

He said that "I have already explained the different symptoms of different //varṇas//---//brāhmaṇa// will be like that; //kṣatriya// will be like that; //vaiśyas// will be like that; //śūdras// will be like that---so," he says, "if these symptoms are found," //anyatra...// Suppose one is not born in the //brāhmaṇa// family---he might have taken birth in a lower family---but he has acquired... If he has acquired the qualities of a //brāhmaṇa,// he should be accepted as //brāhmaṇa.// This is the process. Or if one is born in a //brāhmaṇa// family but he has not attained the qualities, neither he is working as a //brāhmaṇa,// then he should be accepted either //kṣatriya, vaiśya// and //śūdra.//

So this is the system. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu also wanted to introduce this system.

> kibā śūdra kibā vipra nyāsī kene naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]

He never accepted this, that by birth. No. Either he is a //brāhmaṇa// or he is a //śūdra,// by caste or by birth, //kibā vipra kibā śūdra nyāsī kene naya;// either he's a //gṛhastha// or a //sannyāsī,// it doesn't matter. He can become a //guru.// How? //Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā.// One who knows the principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one who understands Kṛṣṇa, he can become a //guru.// So //guru// is the post given to the //sannyāsīs,// to the //brāhmaṇas.// Without becoming a //brāhmaṇa,// nobody can become a //sannyāsī,// and //sannyāsī// is supposed to be the //guru// of both all the //āśramas// and all the //varṇas.//

So the preaching work... We require so many //sannyāsīs.// People are suffering all over the world for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that there is no scarcity; this is false propaganda. The only scarcity is that there is no Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the difficulty. Actually that is the fact. Take some practical example: I have traveled all over the world many times. I have seen America from village to village, Africa, Australia. There is so much land vacant that if we properly utilize them, we can produce so much food grains that we can feed ten times as many population as it is now. That's a fact. We do not utilize the land properly. And Kṛṣṇa has given us the formula, //annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]: "You produce //anna.//" //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni.// Then the animals and the human being will be well fed and they will be happy. If anyone, either animal or man, has his belly filled up with sufficient food, he'll never be dissatisfied. That is the nature. So unfortunately we are not following the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā.// If we follow the whole social system, political system, economic system of the whole world will be very, very nice, and everyone will live very peacefully and there will be no fight, no "ism," no schism. Everything will be all right. That is the purpose of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Don't think that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is a matter of sentiment. No, it is practical.

The... Just like in America, they produce huge amount of grains. Sometimes they throw it in the sea on account of overproduction. Why overproduction should be given on the sea? It should be utilized. There are so many people starving. But this political situation is there that everyone is thinking, "This is my country. This is my home. This is my land." This is called //māyā. Ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. //Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti.// Everyone is under this impression, "I am this body, and anything belonging to this body, that is mine," or "my nation." This conception should be given up. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. Everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also, the same thing is confirmed:

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ
> sarva-loka-maheśvaram
> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati
> [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]

The //śānti...// Everyone is trying to have peace---peace of the mind, peace of the society, peace of the nation. Very good. But you do not know how to get this peace. That is described in every Vedic literatures.

Therefore Vedic knowledge is so important. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. The Supreme Lord is the leader. He's also a living being like us. He's not a dead stone. He is... Just like Kṛṣṇa, when He comes, He lives like us, just like human being. So similarly the... Not similarly. Kṛṣṇa is a living being like us. He has got also two hands, two legs, one head, as you have got. But what is the difference between you and Him? The difference is that //eka,// that singular number living being. //Vidadhāti kāmān bahūnām,// He maintains everyone, and we are maintained. That is the difference. We plural number living entities, we are maintained, and He, the Supreme Lord, being, Supreme Being... In the dictionary, English dictionary, God means Supreme Being. So Supreme Being, He's also living being. He's not a dead stone. The difference is that He is the maintainer, and we are maintained. He is the ruler; we are ruled. This difference we have to understand. And He is the proprietor; we are servants. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy is this. That is a fact. //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]].

So this consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is being spread all over the world for the peace of the world, for the peace of the mind, for the peace of the society. So take it very seriously. It is very authorized. It is not a concocted speculation; it is fact. And it is happening so. Now these American boys and girls who have come, spending thousands of rupees here... And they have no such distinction that "Here is Indian. He is African. He is //brāhmaṇa.// He's //kṣatriya.//" Why? Because they have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So this movement is so important that everyone from every part of the world, they should take part in this movement, and there will be peace in the world. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is this. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's birthday is today. In this land, in this very spot we are sitting now, He appeared for this mission. And He said that,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haile yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission.

> pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma
> sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma
> [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]

And that is being done. And the people from all parts of the world, they are responding. There is very, very good scope for spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and learned circle, important men in all parts of the society and world, they are appreciating this mission. //Bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya...// It was Caitanya Mahāprabhu's desire that especially those who are born in India, and especially in Bengal, because Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared in this land of Bengal. So it is the duty to spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. But unfortunately they are not coming forward. Anyway, it doesn't matter whether he is Bengali or Hindu or Muslim. Anyone who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, he can spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And there is great necessity, great necessity. And the preaching work is meant for the //sannyāsīs.//

So we have got some //sannyāsīs// who are doing very nicely, so today we shall make a number of //sannyāsīs// more to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. And those who are going to take //sannyāsa,// they should remember how much responsibility they have got. So live like a very strict //sannyāsī.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu took Himself //sannyāsa// at the age of twenty-four years. So it is not that in old age one has to take //sannyāsa.// That is not in the //śāstra.// From //brahmacārī āśrama// one can enter into the //gṛhastha-āśrama// or //vānaprastha-āśrama// or //sannyāsa-āśrama// as he thinks fit. There is no such rules and regulation that only the old man without any energy, he'll take //sannyāsa.// No. Rather, the young men.

Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu did personally. He was twenty-four years old. He had beautiful wife, young wife, sixteen years old, at home; very, very affectionate mother; and His position was very great. Not as a //brāhmaṇa,// but still, as young man He could collect 100,000's of men by His order only, to make civil disobedience movement upon the Kazi in this land. So the civil disobedience movement was started by Caitanya Mahāprabhu for a good cause. So there are so many things. I especially appeal to the native of this land to take part in this movement of Caitanya Mahāprabhu for the benefit of the world. And we are trying to construct a very attractive temple here. Let them cooperate. It doesn't matter whether he is Hindu, Muslim. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is for everyone. Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted Haridāsa Ṭhākura as His chief disciple. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was born in a Muhammadan family, and his mission was to introduce this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// chanting. //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma iva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

**Devotees:**
//...nāsty eva gatir anyathā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
And He made Haridāsa Ṭhākura Namācārya, the //ācārya// to introduce Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// and Haridāsa Ṭhākura was chanting three //lakhs,// counting daily. That means the whole day and night. So, so nice movement, everyone should take part in it and dedicate to the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And it is not at all difficult. It is very easy. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,

> āmāra ajñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa
> yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

Anywhere, either you are in this district or that district, it doesn't matter. Either you are at home or outside home, it doesn't matter---you become a //guru,// everyone. "How shall I become //guru?// I have no qualification." Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "You don't require any qualification. You simply require one qualification: that you repeat the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā.// That's all." //Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. That's all. You become a //guru.// Don't adulterate //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// like a rascal or nonsense. Present it as it is, //Bhagavad-gītā.// Then you become a //guru.// You can become a //guru// in your family. You can //guru// your society, your nation, wherever you are. And if it is possible, you go outside and preach this mission of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Therefore our movement's name is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, you accept and preach, you become //guru.//

Thank you very much.

**Prabhupāda:**

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Manjurani? This is the last one, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Rāseśvarī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rāseśvarī dāsī. Come on now. Hmm. Then?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
//Sannyāsīs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sannyāsīs,// that's all. Where is the //daṇḍa?//

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Where is the //daṇḍa// for the...

**Prabhupāda:**
So somebody explain. You can chant the //mantra// conjointly. //Etām sa āsthāya...//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Etām...// You want me to chant, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And they should repeat it?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they should repeat.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[chants //mantra,// with devotees repeating each word]

> etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām
> adhyāsitāṁ pūrvatamair maharṣibhiḥ
> ahaṁ tariṣyāmi duranta-pāraṁ
> tamo mukundāṅghri-niṣevayaiva
> [SB 11.23.57]

**Prabhupāda:**
You can explain? Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, stand up and explain.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This... This //mantra// was chanted by //brāhmaṇas// from Avantīpura. And Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, after taking //sannyāsa,// He also chanted this //mantra.// The meaning of the //mantra// is that "I shall cross over the ocean of material nescience by following in the footsteps of the previous //ācāryas// and take shelter at the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of liberation." Do you want me to explain it, or is that...?

**Prabhupāda:**
[coughs] Yes, explain.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So this material world is very dangerous.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can hear?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
At every single point one can become entangled and remain embedded in material life. In fact it is to be understood that we have been in this material world for millions and millions of lifetimes. By nature, we are pure. We are eternal servants of Kṛṣṇa, but due to the minuteness of the soul sometimes we have misused our small degree of independence, and so we have been forced to fall down into this material world. Having fallen into this material world we are encountering so many different kinds of sufferings and miseries. Our nature is to be eternal, full of bliss and full of knowledge. But instead we find ourselves having to change body lifetime after lifetime, full of ignorance and full of suffering.

So to get free from this repeated cycle of birth and death is actually the purpose of human life. The animals, the plants, the trees, the aquatics, all other kinds of living entities, they do not have the ability to break free from this repeated cycle of birth and death. But in the human form of life the chance is given that one can once again reawaken his dormant love for Kṛṣṇa. This love for Kṛṣṇa, when it is a awakened, enables one to cross over this ocean of material nescience. What is the process? The process is to follow in the footsteps of the previous great //ācāryas.// It is described that by the mercy of the //ācāryas// this vast ocean of material suffering is reduced simply to the amount of water that is contained within the hoofprint of a calf. So it is by the mercy of //guru// and by the mercy of all the //ācāryas// that one is actually able to break free from this miserable cycle of suffering.

**Prabhupāda:**
...names of Rāmānuja, Madhvācārya, all the big //sannyāsīs...//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
...and last, Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. This order of //sannyāsa// is not simply a modern-day creation. It is understood from the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that //sannyāsa// has been existing..., //tridaṇḍi sannyāsa// has been existing for a very long time. And recently, in the previous thousand years, the great //ācāryas,// all the great //ācāryas// of the Vaiṣṇava //sampradāya,// they all took the //sannyāsa// order of life. Śrī Madhvācārya, Rāmānujācārya and Nimbārka Svāmī, Viṣṇu Svāmī, and also even in the, ah, in the Māyāvādī //sampradāya// the //sannyāsa// order is also there, but it is different..., it is //ekadaṇḍi sannyāsa.// But Śaṅkarācārya of course also took //sannyāsa// at a very young age. But this //sannyāsa// order recently was taken by Caitanya Mahāprabhu in our //sampradāya.//

So it is the bona fide process for breaking free from all kinds of material attachments. When one has firmly resolved that his only business shall be to take the order of the //guru// as his life and soul and to give up all kinds of considerations for bodily comforts, and for any kind of material arrangement, then it is allowed that a person may take //sannyāsa.// The //sannyāsī// has to be very strict in following the principles of strict avoidance of any kind of entanglement with women. This entanglement with woman is described by Śrīdhara Svāmī to come in eight different varieties, beginning simply with remembering, then going on to speaking about any kind of relationship, and seeing a woman with lustful eyes, and meeting in a secluded place, and discussing and making arrangement for a relationship, and making firm resolution, and eventually having some kind of relationship of sex life. The //sannyāsī// must be very strict to avoid any kind of association of this nature, because such association can very quickly cause falldown.

So it is a very strict order, but the //sannyāsī// is empowered by all the previous //ācāryas// that by their mercy he will be able to go throughout the world and deliver all of the fallen souls. So it is by the mercy of //ācārya// that one crosses over the difficult ocean of material life and finally comes to the platform of taking shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Mukunda, the giver of liberation.

**Prabhupāda:**
