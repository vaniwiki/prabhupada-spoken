**Devotee:**
[announcing] March 20th, 1976. Śrīla Prabhupāda went on travelling //sankirtan// to a town two miles from the border of Bangladesh called Haridaspur. Where Thakur Haridas lived for some time. Here they're donating some land to us. Śrīla Prabhupāda is about to speak, I think in Bengali. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
