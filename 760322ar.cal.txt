====== Arrival Talk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So I must first of all thank you for decorating Rādhā-Mādhava so nicely. So we are coming from Māyāpur, from the birthplace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is combination of Rādhā-Mādhava. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya// [//Śrī Guru-paramparā// 6]. So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted that in every town, every village of this globe, this cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be preached. And it was given to the Indians: //bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]. It was the duty of the Indians. But in one sense, Bhāratavarṣa means this planet. Formerly there was one flag, Bhāratavarṣa, and the capital was Hastināpura. Gradually the control of the Pāṇḍavas declined. Up to Mahārāja Parīkṣit, the whole world was Bhāratavarṣa. Now it has become a teeny land, peninsula. So in that sense, anyone who is..., who has taken birth on this planet, it is the duty of him to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, you European boys and girls, you have taken very seriously, and Kṛṣṇa will be very much pleased upon you.

Unfortunately, Bhāratavarṣī is not interested. Here we see side by side the two wings of this house. The one room is interested in making money, and one room is interested in spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So this is the position. We are... Indians, we are neglecting this movement. That is not very good. Recently I had the chance to travel in the villages of Bengal. Oh, it is so pitiable, full of... They have given up this culture of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They have not profited. They have not profited. But unfortunately the leaders, they think that by development of industries they'll be able. No. That is not possible. //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. If you become godless, then you have no good qualification. Everything is finished. //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā manorathena asato dhāvato bahiḥ.// These rascals, godless people, they will simply manufacture plan, //manorathena:// by mental concoction, "Now this, we have made this plan. It will be very nice." But no. That is not possible.

> daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī
> mama māyā duratyayā
> mām eva ye prapadyante
> māyām etāṁ taranti 
> [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]

//Māyā// is so strong that it will break, dismantle, everything into pieces, your plan.

So anyway, Calcutta is my birthplace, so you have kindly come here and conducting this temple. I am very much obliged to you. I cannot remain here; I have to go here and there. Try to raise the standard of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, even there are so many inconveniences, I know. You are coming from a country where material conveniences are greater. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu has advised,

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

So some of you, you have come with your big, big buses and vans to preach in India. You take Caitanya Mahāprabhu's blessings and try to enlighten these people. The people are already... Bhāratavarṣī, the inhabitants of Bhāratavarṣa, naturally they are inclined. Just like in the villages, when we were passing, the boys and children, they were also dancing. That is natural. Some way or other, this India is in a very precarious condition. So you have come, taking so much trouble. And take little trouble. There is no trouble. By the grace of Kṛṣṇa and Caitanya Mahāprabhu there will be no trouble. You'll be happy. Try to preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in India at least for some time, and help them to rise to their standard of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Thank you very much.
