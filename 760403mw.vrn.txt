[Announces] Morning walk, Vṛndāvana, April 3rd 1976. [break]

**Gurudāsa:**
[indistinct] like that. Is that true?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, is it fresh bought.

**Gurudāsa:**
Mmm-hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
But according to the time.

**Gurudāsa:**
I see.

**Prabhupāda:**
This //aṣṭa-kālīya-līlā// or this //Govinda-līlā,// it is not recommended for you. 

**Gurudāsa:**
Mmm-hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is for advanced devotees.

**Gurudāsa:**
Mmm-hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not for the //sannyāsīs.// [laughs] Yes. The building we have?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. [break] [end]
