Translation: "My dear Supreme Lord, You are actually the air, fire, earth, sky, water, the objects of perception, the five senses, the mind, consciousness and false ego. You are everything subtle and gross, including the material elements, and anything expressed either by words or the mind. Indeed, these are nothing but You."

**Prabhupāda:**

> prāṇendriyāṇi hṛdayaṁ cid anugrahaś ca

This is all-pervasive description of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In more simplified way it has been described in the //Śrīmad-Bhagavad-gītā, mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]: "I am all-pervasive." //Avyakta-mūrtina.// "That is also My feature." But this feature, Kṛṣṇa with flute in the hand, that feature is not present. That is called //avyakta.// Everything is Kṛṣṇa, but not in everything His original form is manifested. //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam avyakta. Avyakta// means nonmanifest, nonmanifested. He is everything. It can be compared just like your most intimate friend or family member is playing in the stage. If he is playing there, but still, you cannot recognize him. //Naṭo nāṭyadharo yathā// [[books:sb:1:8:19|[SB 1.8.19]]], Kuntīdevī has said. Just like the dramatist, the actor, he has dressed himself in such a way that although the actor is your very intimate friend or family member, you cannot see. A child, suppose his father is a big actor; he is playing on the stage. So another family member says to the child, "You see your father." But he says, "Where is my father? Where is?" //Naṭo nāṭyadharo yathā.// Everything Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, but because we are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, we cannot see Him. We are challenging, "Can you show me Kṛṣṇa?" You are seeing, but on account of material covering, you cannot see. Kṛṣṇa is there: //aṇḍāntara-stha paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. He is everywhere. That is Kṛṣṇa. //Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. He is always in Goloka Vṛndāvana, but He is everywhere. That is Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference between Kṛṣṇa and ourself. We are sitting here, but we are not in our apartment. Limited. But Kṛṣṇa is unlimited. That is the difference. By foolishness we claim to become Kṛṣṇa, but that is foolishness. Kṛṣṇa is not like that, although He is present before us.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritaḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. When Kṛṣṇa comes just like ordinary human being and keeps with the Pāṇḍavas, people take Him as ordinary human being. That is //mūḍha. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ.// In everything there is Kṛṣṇa. Simply we have to purify our vision to see Kṛṣṇa in every atom, everywhere, whatever we... That is the highest perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and it is described in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta, sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhi nā dekhe tāra mūrti, sarvatra sphūraya tāra iṣṭa deva mūrti// [[books:cc:madhya:8:274|[Cc. Madhya 8.274]]]. When one is fully advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he sees this world... The world is full of //sthāvara-jaṅgama.// Some things, some articles, are moving; some articles are not moving. Just like tree---it is not moving, but an animal is moving. This is //sthāvara-jaṅgama.// So he is seeing the tree or the animals or the hill or the water or the river or the ground. So because he is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he sees nothing but Kṛṣṇa everywhere. //Sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhi nā dekhe tāra mūrti.// He does not see anything else except Kṛṣṇa. And actually that is the fact. Simply we have to purify our eyes, then we can see in everything. He is in the atom even. //Aṇḍāntara-sthaṁ paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham.// But because we are not qualified, therefore we cannot see. One who is qualified, he can see. There is no question of seeing Kṛṣṇa in a particular place.

The other day in Delhi, somebody questioned that "If God is everywhere, what is the use of going to the temple to see Him?" Just see how contradictory it is. If God is everywhere, why He is not in the temple? But these foolish persons, they do not know what he is questioning. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. Just like the electricity is everywhere, but when you catch the switch, then it is under your control. Electricity is everywhere, but still, by arrangement we can touch the electricity or take it into service by preparing electric wiring and switch. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, and you can worship Kṛṣṇa from anything. Everyone knows that this Deity is made of stone. The ground floor, the marble stone, black and white, and the Deity is also black and white. Everyone knows. But why you see the black and white Deity in this temple and gather together and offer prayer? Is it the same marble of the ground, black and white? That means you are seeing in a different position. That is love, love of Kṛṣṇa. Those who haven't got the love, they are seeing that "The same stone on the floor and same stone in the Deity. What these foolish men are worshiping?" They say that "I can worship this stone also." No, no. Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes, that is... The stone on the floor, that is also I am, but I am not present there." This is called //acintya-bhedābheda.// "Yes, stone I am also, but I am not there at the same time."

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagat avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ

These foolish persons, they do not know. They think that "If Kṛṣṇa has spread Himself in everything, then He has lost Himself. So He has no more form," their material calculation. This is called material calculation. I have several times given you the example: You take a big piece of paper and make it small pieces, and you throw it in the air. The big sheet of paper is no longer existing. It is finished. So their calculation is like that, that "If Kṛṣṇa is all-pervasive, then where is His form? His form is finished." This is their character. But that is nonsense. That is Kṛṣṇa, that //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam:// "I am spread everywhere, all-pervasive. But in My person I am not there." //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagat avyakta-mūrtinā, mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni.// But a devotee should understand that Kṛṣṇa is on the throne and Kṛṣṇa is on the floor. Therefore we should be very careful to take care of the floor, to take care of the throne, to take care of the flower, to take care of the dishes. Everything you should worship like Kṛṣṇa. That is... You cannot neglect anything. //Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira mārjanādau.// Everything one. You cannot say, "Kṛṣṇa is here, sitting. I can neglect this floor." That is foolishness. You should take as much care to worship the Deity, to decorate the Deity, as much care to keep the temple very, very cleansed. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. You cannot... You cannot say that "He is working on the garden; therefore he is inferior. I am working directly on the Kṛṣṇa altar." No. The person who is working in the garden, Kṛṣṇa's garden, he should be as careful as the man who is worshiping the Deity in the temple. That is wanted. Kṛṣṇa has expanded. //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam. Tatam// means expansion. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You cannot neglect anything, because everything is Kṛṣṇa. You should worship everything. Don't neglect anything. Kṛṣṇa is everything, varieties. At the same time, He is in His original form. The original form is not there, but everything is Kṛṣṇa. This is simulta... //Acintya-bhedābheda-tattva,// inconceivably, simultaneously one and different. This philosophy, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy, you should always remember. Don't neglect anything of Kṛṣṇa. Everything should be, every small thing. It is Kṛṣṇa's. It is worshipable.

Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja is describing the same thing, //tvaṁ vāyur agnir avaniḥ.// The same thing, //kṣitir āp tej marud vyoma. Vāyu.// Kṛṣṇa is air. Kṛṣṇa is fire. Kṛṣṇa is earth. Kṛṣṇa is water. Kṛṣṇa is sky. Kṛṣṇa is everything. Even the small, very, very minute particle, atom, that is also Kṛṣṇa. So if we always remember like that, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be very, very strong and established. That is wanted. //Sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhi nā dekhe tāra mūrti// [[books:cc:madhya:8:274|[Cc. Madhya 8.274]]]. Why people come here? You have seen while you are walking, a devotee, he was taking the dust, Rāmaṇ Reti, and putting on his head. This is Vṛndāvana---the dust. Vṛndāvana dust is also Kṛṣṇa. Vṛndāvana dust is also Kṛṣṇa. So //ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeṣa-tanaya tad dhāmaṁ vṛndāvanam.// This is the verdict of the //ācāryas.// Vrajendra-nandana, Hari, Kṛṣṇa, He is worshipable, everyone knows. But His //dhāma,// Vṛndāvana, is also as good as Kṛṣṇa. It is also worshipable. Therefore so many devotees, they are keeping strictly in Vṛndāvana. This is the idea. We should not consider Vṛndāvana... Not even Vṛndāvana. Everywhere. Not that we limit Kṛṣṇa within Vṛndāvana. That is special, because Kṛṣṇa came here and displayed His pastimes, a special significance. But wherever you are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is Vṛndāvana. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu: wherever He was going He said that "It is Vṛndāvana." After taking //sannyāsa// He was in Bengal, and He was thinking the Ganges as Yamunā.

So these are not to be copied or imitated. Gradually, as we advance, we can understand that how Kṛṣṇa is all-pervasive. And something is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā...// You cannot say that "I have not seen Kṛṣṇa." This is, I mean to say, foolishness. They say, "Can you show me Kṛṣṇa?" But thing is that he has no eyes to see Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa can be seen. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena// [Bs. 5.38]. You have to... If you increase your love for Kṛṣṇa, then you can see Kṛṣṇa every moment, everywhere. That is the way. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti.// Those who are advanced, saintly persons, they see always Kṛṣṇa. That stage you have to reach. That is the idea. //Sarvaṁ tvam eva saguṇo viguṇaś ca bhūman. Bhūman// means "the great." That is greatness of Kṛṣṇa: "God is great." We should understand how great He is. This is the understanding of His greatness. //Bhūman.// If simply we say God is great and //kūpa-maṇḍūkya-nyāya...//

You know the story, the [indistinct], the frog within the well. So some friend says that "I have seen a great mass of water, Atlantic Ocean." And how he can imagine what is Atlantic Ocean? He is thinking, "That water may be like this well, three feet. All right, accept four feet... Accept five feet. I can..." These rascals who does not know Kṛṣṇa, they think, "All right, Kṛṣṇa may be a little more intelligent than me. That's all." In this way they are thinking. But here it is called //bhūman. Bhūman// means all-pervading. //Sarvaṁ tvam eva saguṇo viguṇaś ca bhūman nānyat tvad asty api mano-vacasā niruktam.// Even if you think that the sky is very, very great, that is also Kṛṣṇa. And if you think the atom is very, very small, that is also Kṛṣṇa. There is no..., nothing greater than Kṛṣṇa, nothing smaller than Kṛṣṇa. There are two contradictory things. So simply if... "Kṛṣṇa is simply as big as the sky"---the //Māyāvādī// philosophy---"He cannot be small like the Deity," that is their mistake. He is as big as the sky and as small as the atom. In the intermediate stage, He is everything. So why He cannot be smaller like the Deity, small Deity, so that I may have the facility to serve Him? I cannot serve Kṛṣṇa when He's as big as the sky. That is not possible. I cannot decorate Him when He shows His //virāṭ-rūpa.// I think the whole world's, all the mills, they cannot supply cloth. [laughter] But Kṛṣṇa agrees to become very small. With little cloth I can dress Him. And Kṛṣṇa accepts. //Yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. Even little small piece of cloth a devotee is covering Kṛṣṇa and thinking that "I am dressing nicely," Kṛṣṇa accepts that. That is Kṛṣṇa. Yes.

So, //aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 1.2.20]. Kṛṣṇa is so kind, He is ready to accept your service. //Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. Simply you require to become a devotee. That is the qualification.

Thank you very much.
