**Prabhupāda:**
//Vaiṣṇava ācāra.// [break] ...how nice. This kind of building cannot be constructed. It will require //crores// of money. Yes. [break]

**Indian:**
...nobody. Only during the rain [indistinct]. Somebody would come here, they would stay here for a few, couple of hours, and then go back.

**Prabhupāda:**
The tank is not with water.

**Indian:**
Yes, they used to have water at both sides of the inside. Now, probably, they are short of water or they have switched on to agriculture. [indistinct] So many they used to have flowers and //tulasī// and all that. Now they have come to agriculture---wheat, barley.

**Prabhupāda:**
Money. Such a nice tank is vacant.

**Indian:**
I remember my young days. People, young boys, they used to come swim here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break] Just see. So you may pay them, say, 150, 200 rupees each. Then it will be all maintained, and that much money you can spend.

**Indian:**
And if it's nicely maintained, possibly you can get some return out of it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That way we shall get fruits and flowers.

**Jayādvaita:**
I was seeing yesterday in Rādhā-Dāmodara Mandira that nothing is nicely maintained except for your rooms.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] [Hindi] Rādhā-Dāmodara temple [Hindi].

**Indian:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [Hindi]

**Indian:**
Oldest place in Vṛndāvana. I am not even aspirant of religion or psychology, but I am told people are very much interested in Hinduism there.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// [Hindi] [break]

**Gurudāsa:**
...should have a nice path all the way around.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [Hindi exchange with vendor selling green beans]

**Lokanātha:**
We can buy some. We should buy some for you, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we can buy the whole thing. [Hindi]

**Lokanātha:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
I'm talking with him. [Hindi---Prabhupāda bargaining with //sabjī//-seller in long exchange] [to devotees:] You have got money?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [laughter] [to Jayatīrtha:] So give him two rupees, eight annas. [Hindi] So give him...

**Gurudāsa:**
Bargain.

**Prabhupāda:**
My father used to do that. He'd go to a vegetable vendor. He has got a big basket, and he'll say, "What do you want for all, the whole basket." So he is ready, because he'll sit down so long, so at very cheap rate he'll give it. And it was not required in the family so much. My mother became very angry, that "You are bringing so many, so much vegetable, it is being spoiled." But he would purchase like that. If you give him in those days fifty rupees to go to the market, he will spend all the money and bring at home. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [Hindi conversation with Indian man, about water and government] We are prepared to spend. [break] ...from saintly person.

**Vrajavāsī:**
//Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Haribol. Jaya-ho!// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Vrajavāsī:**
//Jaya Rādhārāṇī ki!//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [Hindi]

**Vrajavāsī:**
//Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Haribol.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Vrajavāsī:**
//Haribol. Haribol. Haribol.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with //vrajavāsī//] Oh, when our festival?

**Gurudāsa:**
Sixth, seventh and eighth. Tomorrow, next day and the Rāma-navamī. [Hindi] [break]

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
In the //Bhāgavatam// it says that if a person cannot offer a straw mat like that to a saintly person when he visits, he doesn't live in a house...

**Prabhupāda:**
But if he hasn't got extra straw, how can he do?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
He may offer obeisances. If he can't do that, simply cry.

**Prabhupāda:**
Straw? Straw is offered. [walking through a field] Oh, not taken care of.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
You said if he couldn't..., if he cannot do that, he does not live in a house, but he lives in a tree full of snakes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So he has offered seat.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? In the //Bhāgavatam// it says that although Lord Viṣṇu is the controller of everything, He is particularly in charge with the mode of goodness, and He is associated with maintenance. So is it that in order to maintain something in this material world also, there has to be the touch of the mode of goodness?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

When the heart is cleansed of the dirty things, //rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ,// the modes of //rajaḥ// and //tamaḥ,// ignorance and passion, then he is situated in the //sattva-guṇa.// There are three //guṇas.// If you become released from the //tamo-guṇa// and //rajo-guṇa,// naturally you are situated in the //sattva-guṇa. Sthito sattve prasīdati. Tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye, ceta etair anāviddham.// When the heart is not attacked by this //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// then it remains fixed up in //sattva-guṇa.// Then...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
//Evaṁ prasanna-manaso?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]. Then he becomes //prasanna-manasaḥ,// happy mood. Then he can cultivate devotional service. Otherwise not possible. //Ceta etair anāviddhaṁ sthito sattve prasīdati.// Unless one is situated in //sattva-guṇa,// there is no possibility of peacefulness.
