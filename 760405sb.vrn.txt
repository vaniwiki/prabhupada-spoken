**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:** Translation: "Therefore, O Supreme Personality of Godhead, the best of all persons to whom prayers are offered, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because without rendering six kinds of devotional service unto You---namely without offering prayers, dedicating the results of activities to You, worshiping You, always remembering Your lotus feet and hearing and speaking about Your glories---who can achieve that which is meant for the paramahaṁsas?"

**Prabhupāda:**
[taped from a distance, indistinct from this point]

> tat te 'rhattama namaḥ stuti-karma-pūjāḥ
> karma smṛtiś caraṇayoḥśravaṇaṁ kathāyām
> saṁsevayā tvayi vineti ṣaḍ-aṅgayā kiṁ

So //bhakti// is under the control of //paramahaṁsas. Bhakti// is not available in the market, [indistinct]. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said that [indistinct] you can purchase. Eh? //Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa, rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ, krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate, labh..., labhyate. Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:8:70|[Cc. Madhya 8.70]]]. This is the exact translation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We have given this name Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The exact Sanskrit [indistinct] is //kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ. Matiḥ// means [indistinct]. We have taken this verse. So we are distributing this. Anyone can purchase. Hmm? Rūpa Gosvāmi has advised, "Purchase and indulge." Therefore, as paupers, here we are asking everybody, "Please purchase Kṛṣṇa consciousness." This is our business. We are also businessmen. These books, this is business. What is this business? "Please purchase Kṛṣṇa consciousness." They are seeing that we can act in business [child crying loudly in the background; Prabhupāda says something aside] Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmi has advised that //kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ. Krīyatāṁ.// Again he advises everyone, "Please purchase //kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ.//" The reference is [indistinct], that those who are actually eager to purchase, we are giving knowledge that "Here is Kṛṣṇa //bhakti: kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ,// here." There is no other [indistinct] than Kṛṣṇa //bhakti.// This is required.

So [indistinct] has advised to purchase, but one can enquire how it is prescribed. How it is prescribed? I want to purchase [indistinct], but how is it prescribed? Here, it is prescribed here, prescribed is here, ah, //laulyam ekalaṁ api mūlyam.// First of all, to purchase Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it does not require any [indistinct]. It cannot be purchased by any [indistinct]. Then, what? [indistinct] //Laulyam ekalaṁ api mūlyam// [[books:cc:madhya:8:70|[Cc. Madhya 8.70]]]: I must have Kṛṣṇa in my life. This is required. If one is very, very eager, just like Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taught us, //śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me// [[books:cc:antya:20:39|[Cc. Antya 20.39]]]: "I do not find Govinda, therefore the whole world is bare." This is the reaction. //Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitaṁ.// This is the price for purchasing Kṛṣṇa. We have got everything given by our //ācāryas.// Rūpa Gosvāmi says that you purchase, then you are [indistinct] twice. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who rigidly purchased, this is [indistinct]. //Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa,// when you live one moment as twelve years. One //yuga// means twelve years. //Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitaṁ:// and the eyes should be filled with tears. Just like in the rainy season, torrents and torrents of rain. //Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitaṁ. Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa,// that Caitanya Mahāprabhu's [indistinct], that without Kṛṣṇa He is jumping on the sea. He has fallen in amongst the [indistinct]. You have read //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// where Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja has explained.

So we [indistinct] in practical terms what is described by Kṛṣṇa. That is the [indistinct]. So therefore it is the [indistinct], I mean to say, //paramahaṁsa-gatau labheta, gata//---is [indistinct] from the //paramahaṁsa.// You have to serve, you have to purchase from the //paramahaṁsas,// not from the [indistinct]. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā,// you have to serve the //paramahaṁsa. Paramo nirmatsaraḥ. Paramahaṁsa// means //paramo nirmatsaraḥ.// No, it does not mean [indistinct]. Those who are envious, [indistinct], //gosvāmis,// what to speak of //paramahaṁsas.// Kṛṣṇa is [indistinct], He will never find out any fault with anyone, anywhere. //Paramahaṁsa,// why they should find fault? This material world means they are under the influence of the material nature. Here everyone has got some difference of opinion, diseased condition. Diseased condition. Just like there are varieties of diseases, similarly, everyone is in the diseased condition by the modes of material nature. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]].

So we are [indistinct] under the influence of material nature. You can say, "But that is not for me."

> piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya
> māyā-grasta jīvera haya se bhāva udaya
> [Prema-vivarta 1]

Just like a person ghostly-haunted, he speaks all nonsense. Similarly, anyone who is under the influence of the three qualities of material nature, he is as good as the person ghostly-haunted, //grasta jīvera haya.// We cannot see on our own account, because every one of us ghostly-haunted, I mean under the influence of the material nature. It is these varieties of philosophies, varieties of [indistinct] anything, without [indistinct] varieties of material nature. So we cannot expect a sane man, so why you should be angry upon a man, or why should you blame or condemn them? This is proper Vaiṣṇava behavior. The Vaiṣṇava’s only desire is that "These people are suffering under the influence of material nature, and they are talking all nonsense. What shall I save them? Why shall I condemn them? Let them pray to Kṛṣṇa, let them become sane and [indistinct]." This is Vaiṣṇava. It is just like the physician is treating patients, and one patient is [indistinct]. But if the physician becomes angry upon the patient, then he cannot treat. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has advised to the preacher,

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

Just to become tolerant. People will break the rules [indistinct] under the influence of the material nature, and they will talk all kinds of nonsense. But we don't care, neither we complain. We never complain. [indistinct] You have to follow the //paramahaṁsas.// Kṛṣṇa is a property of all. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, //vaiṣṇava ṭhākura tomāra kukura baliyā jānaha more.// Just like the dog follows the master to get something. The dog does not go to any master, but he follows his master, and the master out of affection gives him food and sleep. So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has taught us that //vaiṣṇava ṭhākura tomāra kukura baliyā jānaha more.// You have to become a dog of a Vaiṣṇava. And Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that //chādiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistara paveche kebā:// without serving the Vaiṣṇava, nobody can get out of the clutches of //māyā.// That is not [indistinct].

Therefore [indistinct], //guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya, ār nā koriho mane.// Because if you want to have Kṛṣṇa, then //guru. Guru// means [indistinct] following the //paramparā// system. Not self-made //guru,// but that //guru, guru-mukha-padma.// [indistinct] "We are Vaiṣṇavas, but we are under the influence of //māyā.//" You cannot become //paramahaṁsa// by advertising. No, sir, that is not possible. //Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya,// that is the formula to follow the instruction of //guru.// [indistinct] But because he is following the words of the perfect, he is perfect. This is //jñāna.// [indistinct], //yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.// This is [indistinct]. //Paramahaṁsa-gatau:// you have to approach a Vaiṣṇava //paramahaṁsa// and follow his words and instructions; then you get the result. This is [indistinct]. Otherwise [indistinct], it can be purchased very easily, provided you have got the price as it is described in the //śāstras://

> tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet
> samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham
> [MU 1.2.12]

//Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥśreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. //Jijñāsuḥśreya.// One should not approach //guru// for any material purpose. That is [indistinct] not eligible to select the //guru,// and he is not fit for becoming disciple. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥśreya uttamam.// [indistinct]

So, //śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam. Guru// means he is expert [indistinct], in transcendental science, [indistinct]. Then how it can be done, transcendental [indistinct]? It is very easy. That is the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then what is that transcendental literature? Caitanya Mahāprabhu explains, //yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. That is [indistinct]. Simply you take //Bhagavad-gītā, kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.// That is transcendental. //Śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ// [[books:sb:4:29:55|[SB 4.29.55]]]. One who has taken seriously, fully, //śābde pare ca... Śābda// means sound. //Bhagavad-gītā// is also sound, but it is not ordinary sound. If you take //Bhagavad-gītā// as ordinary sound and try to understand by your ordinarily, blunt [indistinct]. It is transcendental literature. It cannot be understood by mundane education. Therefore all these rascals who are advertising that they have great power, great politicians, great students in this and that, [indistinct]. Because they want to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// by the mundane knowledge, mundane education. Is it not? Therefore we cannot. //Śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ, brahmaṇy.// Then //brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam,// the whole life is how to become completely fixed up in Brahman, the Supreme. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā,// we are trying to be happy, peaceful. Everyone now [indistinct]. How you'll get? The process you do not follow, //brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam.// So if you’re fixed up in Brahma, then,

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

So if you get to the //brahma-bhūtaḥ// stage, even if you approach a person who is [indistinct], //yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī// [[books:bg:2:69|[Bg. 2.69]]].

In //Bhagavad-gītā// [indistinct],

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

[indistinct] //Tattva-darśinaḥ// means one who knows what is actually the truth.

> vadanti tat tattva-vidas
> tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam
> brahmeti paramātmeti
> bhagavān iti śabdyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]

That means one who is //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// one who understands the distinction between material knowledge and spiritual knowledge, you have to approach personally. Then you can understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [indistinct] before becoming [indistinct], //tatra laulyam ekalaṁ mūlam, na labhyate janma-koṭi-sukṛtair.// "Yes, I say the price is eagerness." So anyone can say, "Oh, that is [indistinct]. Yes, I shall do it." So Rūpa Gosvāmi immediately warns us, //na labhyate janma-koṭi-sukṛtair:// even after millions of births and millions of past pious activities, this eagerness cannot be. It is not easy. Don't take it as [indistinct]. No, how [indistinct]? Therefore Rūpa Gosvāmi, he warns, "No, don't do that." Just like you are eager to buy something [indistinct] in the market, //janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate,// but it can be, immediately. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's favor, mercy. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lord Kṛṣṇa's mercy, immediately within a second. How?

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

When Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended Jagāi and Mādhāi that "You give up your sinful activities [indistinct] immediately."

So we, if we are serious that to approach Kṛṣṇa and get Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and if we follow the instructions of Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we can become //paramahaṁsa.// [indistinct] Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then life is successful. We can make Kṛṣṇa consciousness very easily; otherwise [indistinct]. Otherwise, if you make a show [indistinct] nice favor [indistinct]. No, it does not require. [indistinct] but eternally how to get the favor of the //paramahaṁsas,// then you will be successful. This is the secret. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ tri-dhātuke kuṇape// [SB 10.84.13]. [indistinct] in //Bhagavad-gītā, vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana// [[books:bg:2:41|[Bg. 2.41]]], [indistinct] one who is //eka// [indistinct] there is no difference [indistinct] This is the way you have to find out the //paramahaṁsas.// If you [indistinct] sincerely, follow the [indistinct], then Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be very [indistinct]. Otherwise, //ananta koti,// [indistinct] after many, many births, pious lives, not cats’ and dogs’ lives [indistinct]. Therefore initiation means to train the candidate to become a perfect //brāhmaṇa,// Vaiṣṇava. Then you can become established in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and remain in your original [indistinct].

Thank you very much.
