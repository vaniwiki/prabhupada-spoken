So since the beginning of this meeting the speakers were talking in Hindi, but these foreigners, they could not understand. But out of reverence they were sitting. So I have taken permission to give them the summary of the speeches spoken by the Vaiṣṇavas, especially by Śrīman Bhakti-dīpa Mahārāja. Bhakti-dīpa Mahārāja is disciple of my elder Godbrothers, so naturally he is very affectionate to me especially. Sometimes we lived together, and we follow the same principles of philosophy. So his speech about //vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhi, arcye viṣṇau-śilā-dhīr,// this is very important. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted that //pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]. He wanted that everywhere in the nook and corner of this world, every city, every town, every village, there should be the chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Chanting should be preached. So by His grace it is going on. Now in the remotest part of the world, even in Australia, the southernmost part of this globe, there also we have got four branches---Melbourne, Sydney---and we have got a very big building, very big temple of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Last year I established, and many hundred thousand devotees they are coming. So certainly the Caitanya Mahāprabhu foretelling is now spreading.

So this //bhajana,// as our speaker, Bhaktamā[?], he said that,

> yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvanda-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajanti māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

So people say that I have done miracle. Maybe. At least it is the first time in the history that Vedic culture in its true form is bring distributed all over the world. We have got many, many appreciation by the learned scholar circle, big, big professors all over the world. They are accepting that this is the first time that India's traditional spiritual culture is being spread. One professor in France, he has plainly said that even Aurobindo or Dr. Radhakrishnan, they presented this Vedic culture in a modernized way, not in its original, traditional form. That is a fact. We don't make any compromise. Therefore we have especially meant Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to follow what Kṛṣṇa says. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, //āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. //Ei deśa.// Wherever you are, it doesn't matter. Either you are in India or in America or France or anywhere, any //deśa,// or any country, wherever you are, just try to deliver them. Because //guru's// business is to deliver the fallen souls.

> saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka
> trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam
> prāptasya kalyāṇa-guṇārṇavasya
> vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam

//Guru's// business is not to exploit the //śiṣya.// It is the business how to deliver. So who can deliver? Who is actually //guru// in the //paramparā// system? //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. So we have to take the authority of become //guru// from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the same thing. Within five hundred years His order is that //āmāra ājñāya guru hañā// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]: "You cannot become //guru// all of a sudden. You must take order from Me." He is //jagad-guru.// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says you, all of you, to become //guru// and deliver. Because there are so many innumerable fallen souls in this age---//mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]---we require hundreds and thousands of //gurus.// But not cheaters. This is the time when required hundreds and thousands of //gurus.// But who will become //guru?// That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's injunction, //āmāra ājñāya:// "By My order you become //guru.// Don't be all of a sudden //guru.// Become //guru// on My order."

So what is the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu? He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa Himself. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya// [Śrī Guru-paramparā text 6]. //Kṛṣṇa varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam...// [SB 11.5.32]. He is Kṛṣṇa Himself. As Kṛṣṇa orders but by directly, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], Kṛṣṇa can do that. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa, but He is acting as devotee. This is... //Kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne. Kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ. Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī could understand that "Here is Kṛṣṇa Himself in the form of Kṛṣṇa devotee. Therefore He can deliver //kṛṣṇa-prema//---not only Kṛṣṇa, but //kṛṣṇa-prema.//" So He is giving very simple formula:

> āmāra ajñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa
> yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

Simple thing. We don't require to be very learned scholar, M.A., Ph.D. If you simply follow what Kṛṣṇa has said in the //Bhagavad-gītā...// If you do not go very deep into Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is described in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// especially, and if you simply read the //Bhagavad-gītā...// We are presenting, therefore, //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, without any adulteration. They give me so much credit, that "You have done wonderful, miracle," and I do not know how to play any miracle. Our Dīpa Mahārāja knows me from the very beginning. I do not know how to play magic. I do not know. But only magic is that I don't adulterate. That's all. I don't adulterate. I say simple thing. Kṛṣṇa said, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. So Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, Absolute Truth, that's all. What difficulty you have? Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. And He says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Four things: "Always think of Me..." So I am teaching them, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. You'll think of Him." So //man-manā.// And who can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa unless he is a devotee? Ordinary man cannot chant. He has no taste. But these boys, they are taking my word very serious. I have asked them to refrain from four kinds of sinful activities: illicit sex, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. They are seriously following. They have no illicit sex. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was questioned by a //gṛhastha// devotee, "How we can understand a Vaiṣṇava?" So He summarily replied that "Vaiṣṇava, to become Vaiṣṇava perfectly, //asat-saṅga-tyāga ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra// [[books:cc:madhya:22:87|[Cc. Madhya 22.87]]]." This is the first principle. Don't associate with //asat. Asato mā sad gama.// So next line He described who is //asat. Asat eka strī-saṅgī, kṛṣṇā bhakta āra//---finished. In two lines we can understand who is a Vaiṣṇava. So I have asked them. These people, European and American, they are ordinarily very much accustomed to these habit: illicit sex, gambling, meat-eating. But upon my word they have given up everything. //Asat-saṅga-tyāga ei vaiṣṇava...//

So there are many things. And other thing? They are reading the Vaiṣṇava literature very nicely, and they are pushing the Vaiṣṇava literature all over the world. By their personal efforts they are giving service. We have about sixty-five volumes, books, each book four hundred pages. And they are introducing in the universities, colleges, libraries. Even sometimes they are beaten. In this way these boys, they are helping this movement. And perhaps you'll be surprised that our sale collection from the books is not less than one //lakh// of rupees per day, sometimes five //lakh// of rupees per day. So this movement has captured the ideas, spiritual ideas of the Western people, by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And as His foretelling, or you are expecting, ambition, //pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126], that is being done. And unfortunately in India they are not received very well. The government is thinking they are..., what is that? CIA. A CIA has become to become Vaiṣṇava dancing in Vṛndāvana. [laughter] Just see their intelligence. [laughs] And Purī also, they are not allowed to enter in the Jagannātha temple. These things are going on. So this is very regrettable, and our Śrīman Bhakti-dīpa Mahārāja has strongly protested against this idea. Therefore I thank him very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
