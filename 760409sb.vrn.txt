**Śāstrījī:**
[chant //mantras//] //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat] //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// 7.9.54 [chants verse; Prabhupāda and devotees respond] [break]

> prīṇanti hy atha māṁ dhīrāḥ
> sarva-bhāvena sādhavaḥ
> śreyas-kāmā mahā-bhāga
> sarvāsām āśiṣāṁ patim

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
[chants synonyms; devotees respond]

Translation: [05:14] "My dear Prahlāda, you are very fortunate. You may know from Me that those who are highly elevated, wise persons try to please Me in all different modes of mellows because I am the only person to fulfill the desires of everyone."

**Prabhupāda:**

> prīṇanti hy atha māṁ dhīrāḥ
> sarva-bhāvena sādhavaḥ
> śreyas-kāmā mahā-bhāga
> sarvāsām āśiṣāṁ patim
> [[books:sb:7:9:54|[SB 7.9.54]]]

So each word in this verse is very important. //Prīṇanti hy atha māṁ dhīrāḥ. Dhira// means very intelligent, not crazy; just the opposite of crazy. //Dhīra.// So Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// who is //dhīra.// There are many places. //Dhīras tatra na muhyati.//

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
> tathā dehāntara-prāptir
> dhīras tatra na muhyati
> [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]

The simple thing, that "I am not this body. I am living within this body, and because I am living within this body, the bodily changes are taking place." This simple thing. A dead child never grows, but a living child grows or changes body. So where is the difficulty to understand that there is something in the body, therefore the body is changing? //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. A child is becoming a baby, baby is becoming a boy, a boy is becoming a young man, young man is becoming a middle-aged, a middle-aged man is becoming old man. So the old man, now, after giving up when it is useless, this body, no more workable, then he must get another body, as we have experienced after one stage of life another stage, another body. Where is the difficulty? Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //dhīras tatra na muhyati.// Those who are intelligent, they are not, I mean to say, bewildered. They accept, "Yes, there is." Only the rascals, they cannot understand, the rascals. The opposite number of //dhīra,// the crazy rascals, they cannot understand. Simple thing.

Now, if you study the whole world at the present moment, they do not believe in the soul. They do not believe in the transmigration of the soul from one body to another. Even big, big professors, big, big learned scholars, they do not believe. So therefore you can understand that what is the present population of the world---all rascals. All rascals. They cannot understand the simple truth, and they are passing on as great scholars, great scientists, great politicians and so on, so on, but all of them rascals. That's all. This is the conclusion. Kṛṣṇa says, //dhīras tatra na muhya...// This transmigration of the soul from one body to another, Kṛṣṇa says, //dhīras tatra na muhyati.// And here also the same thing, //prīṇanti hy atha māṁ dhīrāḥ sarva-bhāvena sādhavaḥ.// The spiritual... If you do not understand what is spirit, then where is the question of spiritual life and advancement of spiritual life? There is no question. This is the beginning of spiritual existence..., education, that "I am not this body. I am spirit soul." //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// They can understand.

So if we are sincerely Kṛṣṇa conscious, if we believe Kṛṣṇa... We have to believe. You believe or not believe, the words of Kṛṣṇa cannot be false. That's a fact. You may be rascal, you do not believe, but those who are //dhīra,// they believe. They believe. If you have love for Kṛṣṇa... There is no question of love or no love. This is the fact. So one has to become... This is the ultimate goal of life, that one has to become //dhīra,// not like cats and dogs, jumping here and there. That is not human life. That is dog life.

> yasyātmā-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke
> sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma-ijya-dhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicit
> janeṣu abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

These classes of men, //yasya,// whose life is bodily conception, "I am body." "I am a Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am..." The whole world is fighting on this, because they are all crazy, not //dhīra.// This is the modern civilization. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape.// This is a bag of bones and flesh and blood, and they are thinking that they are, they are this body. So wherefrom the living force coming if you are this body? Because as soon as the living force is gone, the body is useless, a lump of matter. So do you think this lump of matter is giving life? But they are not //dhīra.// All rascals; they cannot understand. The word is very important. //Dhīras tatra na muhyati.// How the rascals will understand? Therefore our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to educate the rascals, that's all. Simple thing. We challenge everyone that "You are rascal number one. Try to understand Kṛṣṇa." This is our challenge. Come forward. We say, we challenge, "You are rascal number one. You take education in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and make your life perfect." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Nobody is //dhīra.//

So here, those who are //dhīra// actually, those who have understood his identity... //'Ke āmi', 'kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya'// [[books:cc:madhya:20:102|[Cc. Madhya 20.102]]]. This was the question by Sanātana Gosvāmī to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that "You asked me to join Your movement. I was minster in Nawab Hussain Shah's government, chief minister. Now I have... On Your word I have given up. So You have kindly brought me from this hellish condition, simply politics and pounds, shilling, pence. So it is a great mercy for me of Your Lordship. But my first question is //ke āmi:// 'What I am?' " This is the first question. It must be... //Jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. Here the same word is used, //śreyas-kāmāḥ. Śreyas-kāmāḥ.// Anyone who is //dhīra,// he'll inquire about the ultimate goal of life, //śreyas.// There are two things: //śreyas// and //preyas. Preyas// means immediately very nice. Suppose somebody says that "Oh, there is a very nice dancing girl singing, and why you are here, //saṅkīrtana?// What you'll enjoy? Come here. There's a very nice girl." That is //preyas. Preyas// means immediately very pleasing. And one comes here, that is //śreyas,// means it will do him ultimately good. So there are two things, way. Those who are foolish persons, they are after //śreyas...,// er, //preyas,// immediately palatable. And those who are intelligent, //dhīra,// they are after //śreyas. Śreyas-kāmāḥ.// Without becoming //śreyas-kāmāḥ,// nobody can be Kṛṣṇa conscious. If one is //preyas-kāmāḥ,// if one wants to enjoy this material world, sense gratification, he cannot become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is not possible. Only //śreyas-kāmāḥ.//

So how to... "Yes, I am //śreyas-kāmāḥ.// I... Yes, I want what is the ultimate goal of life. Yes." That is... Just like Sanātana Gosvāmī went to Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is a fact. So //śāstra// also says, //tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. The //śreyas-kāmāḥ.// If you are actually you are serious about the ultimate goal of life, then you approach a //guru. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ.// If you are actually inquisitive to understand what is //sreyas,// that is //śreyas-kāmāḥ. Kāmāḥ// means desiring, and //śreyas// means ultimate good. Not //preyas-kāmāḥ.// If you want to enjoy these material facilities, then you can go to such kind of men, such kind of men, and... If you want to learn drinking, so go to a club where drinking is very encouraged. //Preyas-kāmāḥ.// If you want to enjoy sex, go to the club where prostitutes are available. That is //preyas-kāmāḥ.// But if you want to reach the goal of life, then go to Kṛṣṇa conscious movement. There are two kinds of men, //sreyas-kāmāḥ, preyas-kāmāḥ,// so two things are there. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for the //śreyas-kāmāḥ.// And who becomes //śreyas-kāmāḥ? Mahā-bhāga,// who is great fortune. Not ordinary person. Unfortunate or misfortunate, they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Mahā-bhāga.// Very, very great fortunate person.

Caitanya Mahāprabhu confirms this in His teaching to Rūpa Gosvāmī. He said,

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva
> guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

They are traveling, wandering. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa saṅgo 'sya sad-asad janma-yoniṣu// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. These rascals who are not //dhīra,// they are thinking independent, rascals. Not a single moment you are independent. You are controlled. Even if we are dropping our eyelids, there is regulative principles; some demigod is controlling. Breathing. Breathing, there is control. You can breathe for so many years, that's all, and live. And when the breathing is finished, then you are not controller. The great scientists, they are begin oxygen gas, injection. Can you increase the period breathing for a moment? No. Controlled. Controlled. You cannot increase your breathing even for a moment. So the //yogīs,// they try to save the breathing. That is yogic process. //Samādhi.// They practice breathing control so that without breathing they can remain, //recaka, kumbhaka yoga,// so they can increase their life. Suppose I shall live for eighty years or hundred years. There is breathing period. If I can save breathing, then I can live more. Just like your bank balance. If you don't spend it, your balance is all right. But you spend it, then the balance will be zero some day. Similarly, the yogic process is to control the breathing. And the breathing is lost in large quantities when there is sex life. [breathes rapidly and loudly] [laughter] Finished. So control the breathing, it requires celibacy, no sex life. //Yoga-indriya-saṁyamaḥ.// That is called //yoga,// not that showing some gymnastic and smoking and //yoga// system. This is going on. Your country is cheated by so many rascals, //yogīs.// You know it very well. The one great //yogī// was found having sex with his disciple. You know that? Who is that?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
//Sat-cit-ānanda.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So they go for women and money because you are fooled. You are //yoga,// and they show some gymnastic, that's all. But real //yoga// system is //yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ,// how to control the //indriyas,// especially the mind. In this way one can become advanced, //dhīra.// That is //yoga// system. It is an artificial means to become //dhīra,// because without becoming //dhīra// there is no question of advancing in spiritual life. That is not possible.

So this //dhīra,// who can...? //Mahā-bhāga. Mahā-bhāga:// very, very great fortunate person. How he becomes //dhīra? Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān//---this //mahā-bhāga---kono bhāgyavān jīva, guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. By the blessings of //guru...// If by his great fortune he comes to a real //guru,// then he gets the opportunity. That is the test. //Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān.// This opportune is not for everyone. //Kono// means "somebody." So //guru-kṛṣṇa.// If actually one is trying to be //dhīra,// Kṛṣṇa is there within every... //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. And He advises, //guru-kṛṣṇa...// Kṛṣṇa says, "Now..." Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. Dhruva Mahārāja, out of his sentiment, he went to the forest and to see God. His mother said that "Your this mental condition cannot be relieved, because you want to challenge your father to have the kingdom. So I am poor. I am, although your mother, I cannot request your father. So if it is possible, Kṛṣṇa can do it." She was Kṛṣṇa conscious; therefore the child became so nice, Dhruva Mahārāja. A child inherits the quality of mother, boy, and girl inherits the quality of father. That is the general rule. So his mother was devotee, so he'll naturally become a devotee by the advice of the mother. He went to the forest. So..., but he had no spiritual master. Out of sentiment went to the forest. But Kṛṣṇa saw from within that "This child is so serious about Me. Oh, send him Nārada. 'Nārada, you go there. Initiate him.' " //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya// [[books:sb:4:8:54|[SB 4.8.54]]], this //mantra// was given to Dhruva Mahārāja by Nārada Muni. So he practiced that //mantra,// and with austerity, and he saw Kṛṣṇa. And when he saw Kṛṣṇa, he's completely pure from all material desires. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. When Kṛṣṇa wanted to give him benediction, he said, //svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]]: "I am fully satisfied. I don't want anything." This is Kṛṣṇa conscious, //dhīra.// No more want. Why want? Here it is said that //śreyas-kāmā mahā-bhāga sarvāsām aśiṣāṁ patim.// Such persons who are //dhīra// and most fortunate and sees Kṛṣṇa, then what remains to possess? Everything is there. //Sarvāsām aśi...// All kinds of benedictions are there, all kinds of. That Kṛṣṇa will take care.

So these things are very nice, that one has to become //dhīra,// and he can become //dhīra.// Either he was fortunate, or after becoming //dhīra// he is fortunate. Both ways he is fortunate, //mahā-bhāga.// And //sreyas-kāmāḥ.// When one becomes a devotee he does not anymore ask for anything material. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu teaches, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. This is //dhīra.// He frankly says that "I don't want riches. I don't want many followers. I don't want nice wife, very beautiful wife." These things are material demands. They are very much fond of worshiping Durgā. Why? //Dhanaṁ dehi rūpavati bhāryāṁ dehi yaśo dehi.// These are material. But Kṛṣṇa says, "These persons who are asking for material profit from the different demigods, it can be fulfilled. They are fulfilling." But //antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavati alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. These material gains, they will stay for a few days or few years. Because you are creating another body.

So in this body... Suppose you have got immense wealth, immense men under you, or very beautiful wife. How long you shall enjoy? Immediately, //mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]: "You do not like Me. You like these things. All right. At the time of death I shall take away everything---finish." This is fact. After death where is your beautiful wife? Where is your wealth? Where is your followers? Everything finished. Now, according to your //karma,// you have to accept the body of a dog. Nature's way. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. "You have infected doggish mentality. Now you become a dog." This is nature's way. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-sango 'sya// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. You have simply associated with the //tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa,// no //sattva-guṇa,// so you have to accept a body, //rajas-tamo-guṇa. Tamo-guṇa// means animal, and //rajo-guṇa// means the //karmīs,// and //sattva-guṇa// means //jñānīs.// So if one is struggling in this life how to accumulate money, that means //rajo-guṇa. Rajas-tamo-bhāvā kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. There is. We can understand who is under //rajo-guṇa,// who is under //sattva-guṇa,// who is...

> ūrdhvaṁ gacchanty sattva-sthāḥ
> madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasā
> jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthāḥ
> adho gacchan...
> [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]

Those who are //tamo-guṇa,// they are going---//adho gacchanti//---in the animal life. This law is going on. You believe or not believe. If you don't believe, then you are a foolish rascal, and if you believe, then you are a //dhīra.// So we shall become a //dhīra.// That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
