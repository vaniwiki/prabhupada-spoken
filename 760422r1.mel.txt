**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The machine, I forgot to turn it..., one knob down. I wanted to tape what you were saying, because... [break] We find actually it's true that when we try to speak philosophy sometimes to unwilling persons, they take that we are trying to convert them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
And therefore they feel threatened. They react in an adverse way, put up so many barriers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Chanting they will take part. That's it.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Before you went to America, in India, before 1965, were people coming at all, Indian people, to learn anything? Were they interested in any way?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Now they're coming, so many.

**Prabhupāda:**
They were coming, but I was engaged in writing. I was not visiting many... [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
...when they begin to write, then they finish up their activities and retire and simply write. But you wrote first and then came out and distributed it.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
I personally, I don't think that even Americans or Westerners would have accepted even your teachings, as clear as they are, without having your personal association and seeing your example. I think people would have thought that it's totally impossible to do such a thing.

**Hari-śauri:**
It would have remained theoretical. But because you came and showed practical example, then everything has become very easy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Āpani ācārī prabhu jīvera śikṣāya.// That is the way of teaching. Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to do.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
I've read some of your old //Back to Godhead// magazines, and actually you've been saying the same thing all along, with the same force also. Some of your critiques of Dr. Radhakrishnan's //Bhagavad-gītā// and modern science...

**Prabhupāda:**
You have read?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
"Scholars Deluded."

**Hari-śauri:**
Sometimes the devotees say that "Now Prabhupāda is preaching much more strongly than ever before." But then, when we read the old //Back to Godheads,// it's exactly the same.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Even if we read the First Canto of //Bhāgavatam...//

**Hari-śauri:**
It's very powerful.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
You translated that in India before you came. [end]
