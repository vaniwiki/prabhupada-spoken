**Prabhupāda:**
...in this human form of life, but unfortunately, the foolish leaders, they are keeping us in darkness. Therefore Kṛṣṇa personally comes. Whenever people are kept in darkness, that is called //dharmasya glaniḥ// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. //Glaniḥ// means pollution, when the process of life becomes polluted. The process is that from the lower animal bodies we have come through the evolutionary process to this human form of life. Now there is further improvement required. This is the process: more and more. And that improvement goes up to the point of meeting Kṛṣṇa in Goloka Vṛndāvana. //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāmaṁ paraṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. But even after coming to the platform of human being, the leaders, they do not teach them how to go further ahead, up to the point of Kṛṣṇa. They have no knowledge. Therefore they have been called, in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ.//

> na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ
> durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ
> andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās
> te 'pīśa tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ
> [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]

These rascals, so-called leaders, //gurus// and others, they do not know what is the goal of life. //Na te viduḥ.// They do not know. Some imaginary theory, "I am God," "I am this," "I am that." A commonsense: "If I am God, then why I am under the control of the material nature?" Eh? This another rascal came, that "I am God." If you are God, so why you have become dog? They say it is //līlā.// [laughter] Just see. God has come to manifest his //līlā// by becoming a dog, and he's beaten. Whole day, night, he's hungry. And he has come to your home to ask some food, and you are beating. So God is displaying this //līlā.// Just see how foolish rascal they are. This is going on.

So don't be misguided by such rascals. Either he may be parents or //guru// or superior, teacher, whatever it may be, don't be misguided. Fortunately you have come to this platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Don't misuse it. That is my request. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung, //hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu:// "My Lord Kṛṣṇa, I have simply wasted my time." Why? Now, //manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā, jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu:// "I got this human form of life. It is meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's pastimes with Rādhārāṇī, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. So I did not care for that. That means knowingly I have drunk poison."

So my only request is that Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the most scientific movement to save the human society from falling down again in the cycle of birth and death. It is very scientific movement. The cycle of birth and death is going on. We are eternal. The people have been put into so deep darkness, they do not know what is going on, what is the aim of life. They do not know. //Na te viduḥ.// They do not know. Whimsically everyone is manufacturing something, nonsense. //Jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu.// What Kṛṣṇa says, we have to accept that. Then we are safe. Otherwise we are lost again. So fortunately you have got this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so utilize your life properly. You have got immense literature. Read it. Digest it. Make your life perfect. That is my request. Don't spoil it. At least you have come to the shore of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. It is great fortune, //bhāgyavan jīva.// Unless one is very fortunate, he cannot come to the shelter of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That's a fact. So don't misuse it. That is my request.

I am very glad to see you, you are so enthusiastic. And you should be enthusiastic.

> utsāhād dhairyāt
> tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt
> sato vṛtteḥ sādhu-saṅge
> ṣaḍbhir bhaktir prasidhyati
> [//Upadeśāmṛta// 3]

For enhancing devotional activities one must be very enthusiastic. That is the first proposition. Don't be dull. Enthusiastic. //Utsāhāt.// And //dhairyāt,// patiently. //Utsāhād, dhairyāt, niścayād. Niścayāt// means firmly convinced: "Yes, surely I shall meet Kṛṣṇa and go to Him, back to home, back to..." //Niścayāt. Utsāhād dhairyāt niścayāt tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.// But you have to do the prescribed duties. //Sato vṛtteḥ.// You must be very honest, and //sādhu-saṅge,// and in the association of devotees. Six: //utsāhā..., utsāhā, dhairyā, niścayāta// and //tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt, sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]], and being honest. If we follow these six principles, then it is sure. //Ṣaḍbhir bhaktir prasidhyati.//

And just the opposite number is //atyāhāra,// eating too much, or... //Āhāra// means eating and //āhāra// means collection---too much collection unnecessarily. Of course, for our preaching work we require, but we shall collect as much as we require, not that keep money in the bank and spend for some other purposes. That kind of collection is dangerous. And too much eating is also dangerous. //Atyāhāra.// And //prayāsa. Prayāsa// means endeavoring too much for getting something. Our life should be very simple. We shall act so simply that there is..., we shall have to save time for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we should not attempt anything which is very difficult to execute. So //atyāhāra prayāsaś ca prajalpa,// unnecessary talking all nonsense, politics, rascaldom, speculation, this, that. No. Be grave. Don't talk nonsense, waste time. //Atyāhāra prayāsaś ca prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ. Niyamāgraha// means not to accept the regulative principle, //niyama āgraha. Āgraha// means not to accept, and //niyamāgraha// means simply I am packed up with the regulative principle but I do not see whether I am making progress. So at least one should stick to follow the regulative principle. That is good. That must be done in the lower stage. So //niyamāgraha. Atyāhāra prayāsaś ca prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ,// and //laulyam,// greediness. And //jana-saṅgaś ca,// and to associate with nondevotee, unwanted person. So these six things should be avoided, and the first mentioned six things should be accepted. Then our progress is sure, without any failure. We have published this book, //Nectar of Instruction.// Have you seen? That is Rūpa Gosvāmī. All these instruction are there. Read it very carefully. Everything is there.

So only point is that you have got this human form of life, //nṛ-deham ādyam.// This is the opportunity, good boat. Just like to cross over the sea, if you get a very nice boat, that is one's surety. So //nṛ-deham ādyam,// this body, is good boat for crossing over the material nescience ocean. And //guruḥ karṇa-dharaḥ:// "And the captain is //guru.//" The boat is there and captain is there. And the instruction of Kṛṣṇa is favorable wind. //Nṛ-deham ādyaṁ guruḥ karṇa-dharaḥ.// In this way you have got this opportunity. Now you cross over from the material world to the spiritual world. If you don't take this opportunity, then //ātma-hā//---you are committing suicide. And the nature's law is very strict. Just like I was explaining, we are coming very illuminated road, and just one yard after there is dark field. Both are side by side. But if we... [break] [end]
