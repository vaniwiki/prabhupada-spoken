//Adhuna//---"right now"; //mahā-bhāga//---"O the most fortunate." Parīkṣit Mahārāja is addressed as //mahā-bhāga. Mahā// means great, and //bhāga,// the same //bhaga,// from the word //bhaga, bhāga.// Bhagavān and //bhāgyavān, mahā-bhāga//---these terms are applicable to the very, very great fortunate, opulent. Actually Bhagavān, this word is applicable to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// you will find, whenever Kṛṣṇa is speaking, Vyāsadeva has written, //śrī bhagavān uvāca.// Real Bhagavān is Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. Everyone has got little fortune, opulence, but nobody is comparable with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore in the //śāstra// it is said, //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam:// "Real Bhagavān is Kṛṣṇa," the supreme controller. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. But if one has got little flavor of Kṛṣṇa, he is called //bhāgyavān,// not Bhagavān; //bhāgyavān,// fortunate. The word is coming from the same //bhaga.// I have several times explained, //bhaga// means richness, //bhaga// means influence, //bhaga// means bodily strength, //bhaga// means knowledge, //bhaga// means beauty and //bhaga// means renunciation. //Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. And //bhaga// means reputation, fame. So these are the symptoms of //bhaga.// So Parīkṣit Mahārāja, although nobody can be equal to Kṛṣṇa... Bhagavān means //asamaurdha:// nobody is equal to Him; nobody is greater than Him. That is Bhagavān. I am fortunate, you are fortunate, but we have got many equals and many greater than. But when you reach somebody where you find nobody is equal to Him and nobody is greater than Him, that is real Bhagavān. This is a logical conclusion, who is Bhagavān. Nowadays so many rascals, they write "Bhagavān." That is blasphemy. If Bhagavān likes, such persons should be punished. But Bhagavān excuses. That is another thing. So Bhagavān is Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. Nobody should try to become equal to Him. That is not possible.

So here Śukadeva Gosvāmī is addressed as //mahā-bhāga. Mahā// means great, and //bhāga// means fortunate. Because he is very fortunate, he is describing //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Again //Bhāgavatam,// the same word //bhaga// comes. //Bhāgavat. Bhāgavat... Vat,// this word, is used when the meaning is "possessing." //Asty arthe vatup.// Bhagavān, //bhāgyavān// and //bhāgavat. Bhāgavat// means one who has power to possess the Supreme Lord. He is called //bhāgavata.// There are two kinds of //bhāgavata:// one is //grantha-bhāgavata// and one is person //bhāgavata.// A devotee, he is called //bhāgavata,// and the book in which the pastimes or characteristics of Bhagavān is described, that is called //Bhāgavata.// So this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata... Śrī// means beauty. Again //vat. Bhāgavat, śrīvat. Śrī// means very beautiful. So every //śloka// you'll find very, very beautiful. Five thousand years ago these verses were written. There is no comparison. Nobody can write such verses even up to date. It was written by Vyāsadeva, Veda-vyāsa.

So //mahā-bhāga yathā eva narakāt naraḥ.// So this is Sixth Canto. In the Fifth Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there is description of the hellish condition of life. According to the... Just like there is punishment according to criminality, similarly, there is punishment by nature's law. According to impious life, there is punishment. So people do not care for impious life. That is misfortune. No knowledge. Impious or vicious activities are done out of ignorance. Just like a person commits some criminality without knowing the laws, government laws. Ordinarily, just like in your country, "Keep to the right." If you drive your car on the left side, immediately you become a criminal. So in our country the car is driven on the left side. In this country the car is driven on the right side. So if some Indian gentleman says that "I am accustomed to drive on the left side. So what is wrong there?" "No, this country's law is 'right side.' You know or do not know, whatever may be in your country, because you have driven your car on the left side, you are criminal." So ignorance is no excuse. In the law court if you say, "Sir, it was not known to me," so that does not mean that you will be excused. Similarly, knowingly or unknowingly, if you do something sinful act, then you are immediately criminal. You'll be punishable. It doesn't matter whether you know or not know. Just like fire. This child, if he touches the fire, the fire will not excuse. There is no consideration, "Sir, here is a little child. He does not know this fire is burning." But as soon as he touches, it will burn. This is nature's law. You infect some disease knowingly or unknowingly, it doesn't matter, but the disease will be manifest. Suppose you have infected smallpox infection, contamination. Then it will be manifest.

So this education is lacking now. They are... Everyone is thinking that he's independent, he can do whatever he likes. That is not possible. Then you'll be punished. Nature's law is so strict, stringent. Therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. You cannot escape the stringent laws of nature. Little discrepancy... Suppose you can eat eight ounce. If you eat nine ounce, then you will have to starve for three days. There is no excuse. "Why you have eaten more than eight ounce?" The nature is there. Just like we require salt in our foodstuff, everyone. But if the salt is little more, it is useless. And if the salt is little less, that is also useless. It must be exactly to the quantity. So nature's law is like that. People, if they simply study nature's law, he becomes a learned scholar. There is no need of going to school, college. But if he sees how nature is working... You can see this flower. Every flower is so beautiful, nicely constructed symmetrically. You'll find two flowers, the small fiber coming out exactly in the same way. There is no question of accident. There is no question of accident. They are also being manipulated by the laws of nature. And what is the laws of nature? The laws of nature is acting under the supervision of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

The nature is instrument. Just like any machine. Take typewriter machine. The typewriter machine or any machine, working very nicely, but the machine is not working nicely; the man, the person who is typing, he is doing nicely. There may be wonderful machine, computer, but there must be one actor, one manipulator. So the..., this nature is an instrument only. The actually worker is Kṛṣṇa. That is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā: mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. But these rascals, they are praising the machine. They have no information that who is the person, what is the brain behind this machine. That is ignorance. That is the difference between the so-called scientists and devotee. A devotee knows that all these wonderful things which are happening, behind this thing there is Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says---we believe that. And that's a fact. If you paint a very nice flower, how much labor you require. Still, it cannot be so beautiful as the natural flower. So don't think the natural flower has come accidentally. No. It was done by the machine manipulated by Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa understanding. It is confirmed in the //śāstra, parasya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]. //Para,// the Supreme, His energies are multi-energies. They are acting the same way the machine is working. You can see potency or the power of a person. Just like you see airplane: the pilot is sitting there, pushing one button; immediately the turning, such a huge machine is turning, simply by putting button. So this is an arrangement of energy. Similarly, the whole material world is working by putting the button, pushing the button. Don't think it is going on automatically or accidentally. These are all rascaldom. There is hand in everywhere.

So //narakāt naraḥ.// We should always remember that if we commit some sinful activities there is punishment. That has been described in the previous chapter, Fifth Canto. Therefore Parīkṣit Mahārāja... That is Vaiṣṇava. Parīkṣit Mahārāja is Vaiṣṇava. He is very unhappy that so many living entities, they are rotting in this //naraka,// hellish condition of life. So he is asking,

> adhuneha mahā-bhāga
> yathaiva narakān naraḥ
> nānogra-yātanān neyāt
> tan me vyākhyātum arhasi

"I am very sorry that so many living entities are suffering. So if there is any way to give them relief?" That is Vaiṣṇava. And //avaiṣṇava// sees another person is suffering; he doesn't care: "Let him suffer." We have come to that state. I heard from one of my disciples that here, in New York, if somebody is killed on the road, nobody will care. Is it a fact?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we have come to that stage of civilization. But Parīkṣit Mahārāja, simply by hearing from Śukadeva Gosvāmī that "A person, if he commits sinful activities, he suffers like that," he is not seeing; he is compassionate: "How such person can be delivered?" This is the inquiry, that "They are suffering for some sinful activities. How they can be saved?" This is Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava means //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// Vaiṣṇava is unhappy by seeing others' unhappiness. He has no unhappiness. Personally he has no unhappiness.

Nityānanda Prabhu, He is... //Hā hā prabhu nityānanda, premānanda sukhī, kṛpābalokana koro, āmi boro duḥkhī. Nityānanda// means... //Nitya// means eternally; //ānanda// means happy. So Nityānanda has no unhappiness. But He was passing on the street, there was a crowd, and Nityānanda Prabhu inquired, "Why there is so much crowd?" So somebody informed that "There are two brothers, Jagāi and Mādhāi, and they are very fallen souls, although they were born in //brāhmaṇa// family, very nice, rich family. But being addicted to drinking and prostitution, they have become now rogues, thieves, this way. So they are disturbing the whole neighborhood." So Nityānanda Prabhu considered, "So these two brothers are so fallen? So why not deliver them first?" This is Nityānanda Prabhu. "Then My Lord..." Nityānanda Prabhu considered Caitanya Mahāprabhu as His master. So "My master's name will be famous, because the master's propaganda is 'Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa,' so if I can induce these two brothers to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, they will be saved. So why not try?" This is Nityānanda Prabhu, that //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī:// He is happy personally, but because He knows that "These drunkards, woman-hunters, prostitute-hunters will suffer very, very severely, so why not deliver them?" This is Nityānanda Prabhu, Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava, you will find so many others also. In your country there is Lord Jesus Christ. When he was being crucified, still he was saying, "My Lord, excuse them. They do not know what they are doing." This is Vaiṣṇava. They are not unhappy, and they can tolerate any unhappy position. But they are... Therefore they come to deliver so many fallen souls.

So here Parīkṣit Mahārāja, out of compassion he inquired from Śukadeva Gosvāmī, "These persons, they are rotting in the //naraka.// Is there any means to deliver them?" That he's saying. //Nānā ugra-yātanā. Ugra-yātanā.// These are described. We find also there are many persons, they are suffering //ugra-yāta. Ugra// means severe, severe punishment. There are living entities, they are suffering so many //ugra-yātanā.// So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to save people from the severe punishment of materialistic life. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement, Kṛṣṇa's movement, is to save. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]], Kṛṣṇa said. Kṛṣṇa also very compassionate: "Whenever there is discrepancies, people put themselves in great suffering. //Māyā// will not excuse. Nature will not excuse. At that time I come to deliver them, to give them instruction, 'Why you are suffering in this way? Do this way.' " Kṛṣṇa says, "Accept this philosophy." What is that? //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]: "Always think of Me, become a devotee of Me." //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī:// "Worship Me and offer little obeisances unto Me." Four things. It is not difficult. Just like a child: he is offering obeisances, he is offering a flower. This is //bhakta.// And he is thinking of... //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām.// Even a child can do. Where is the difficulty? And Kṛṣṇa assures, "If you do these four things," //man-manā bhava mad, mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]], "without any doubt you'll come back to Me." And people are not agreeing even to do these simple things. Still, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is there to teach people how to become devotee and save from the greatest sufferings of hellish condition of life.

Thank you very much.
