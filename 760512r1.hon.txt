**Prabhupāda:**
Where did he get this idea, not to trust me? [indistinct]

**Govinda dāsī:**
So that’s what I was trying to ask.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Govinda dāsī:**
That’s what I was trying to ask.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Govinda dāsī:**
That was the reason that I was trying to ask those questions.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has become impersonal. He is simply out of the jurisdiction of personal care. The //guru// is personal or Kṛṣṇa is impersonal?

**Govinda dāsī:**
He speaks of the //guru// principle and that his spiritual master is within his heart, and that..., and he doesn’t accept the personal service of the physical manifestation.

**Prabhupāda:**
He does not understand. Don’t [indistinct]. Who cares for his philosophy?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Not for very long. I am simply concerned for him.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is natural, but if he wants to avoid being saved, then how can you save him?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
If he wants to commit suicide, then who can save him? He will do it, [indistinct].

**Devotee:**
He’s downstairs in the morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
What he doing?

**Devotee:**
I don’t know. I stay up here during //ārati// in case you mean...

**Prabhupāda:**
Govinda?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
