**Prabhupāda:**
Why not translate from the very beginning, in your own way?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

[long pause; background construction noises and talking]

**Prabhupāda:**
This land is especially assembled for becoming New Navadvīpa. But the demons are [laughs] predominating. You gradually take over the charge from the demons.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
So much food, so much land, water. It should be completely spiritual. No material life. Simply we require to keep more cows to get directly fresh milk.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Keep more cows?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. If there is food, and if there is milk, that is sufficient. No brain required. [indistinct], and one glass milk, that is sufficient for the whole day.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Rākṣasāḥ kalim āśritya jāyante brahma-yoniṣu// [//Varāha Purāṇa//]. Why your countrymen should not accept? Why they should become so much fool? From your example, it appears Americans are not fools. Try to convert them.

**Devotee:**
They have [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Tell them that "You are not fools. Why you are becoming fools?" The Darwin’s theory is that his forefather is monkey, so how he has become tiger? Through meat-eating. Why they are meat-eating? Monkey doesn’t. Then you are not really self-realized. Rascal! When you are born [laughs], you are begotten by the dog or tiger, not by monkey. Tell them like that. Otherwise you would have been vegetarians according to Darwin’s theory. No monkey is meat-eater. How you changed your habits if you are actual descendant from monkey? So how you have changed your habits in the matter of eating? Put some humorous question. What is the answer, that you are improved than the monkey?

**Devotees:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, you have not improved. You cannot jump like monkey from one branch to another, so how you have improved? Simply by eating, you have improved? A monkey can keep dozens of wives. You cannot maintain even one wife. So how you have improved than the monkey? You have not improved. To maintain two-dozen wives it, is not a [indistinct] job. [laughter] [laughs]You must have potency. But you have no potency; you are impotent. You cannot maintain, you cannot satisfy even one wife. You are divorced. Generally the divorce case takes place because you cannot satisfy the wife by sex. That is the psychology. That is the only psychology. Ordinarily, women, unless they will be satisfied by sex, they will not be, I mean to say, faithful wives. This is women’s psychology. So most of the divorce case takes place because the man cannot satisfy the wife by sex. You’ll see. By inquiry you will find. And because the husband mixes with so many other women, he cannot satisfy his wife. This is the psychology. So how you have improved than the monkey? The monkey can satisfy three dozen wives. Ask them this question: "How you have improved? You have improved little by dressing yourself; monkeys are always naked. [aside:] Come on. Hare Krsna. So you have improved little, but again you are going to undress yourself. So that is also not very satisfactory. In what way you have improved? [aside:] Come on! Come on! Govinda dāsī, you distribute this //prasādam.// [sounds of eating] [end]
