**Prabhupāda:**
Then what is the use?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
We have to stop the manufacturing of ideas. What you have learnt by manufacturing ideas? You hear. Because I do not wish to repeat the same thing. He left everything. He was in charge of the center here, and all of a sudden he left, everything chaotic condition. But I am here to revive that chaotic condition, and now we are in this position. What he has done? And leaving us in such a condition. Is this [indistinct]? He left us and returned to [indistinct]. Is it not? So if he leaves us [indistinct]. Anyone who leaves us [indistinct]. [indistinct] That is a fact. So if he decides with intelligence that "I’ve [indistinct]," that is all right.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Was there any settlement? When he talked to you today, did he indicate that he wanted to come back? Or does he...

**Prabhupāda:**
He does not speak anything. He simply hears. Now you can talk with him. If he actually sticks to our principles, that is Kṛṣṇa’s [indistinct]; otherwise, let him do whimsical activities his whole life. But these whimsical activities will not help him. Not only he, anyone who does whimsical activities. So many big, big, they have come here. That is not good. [indistinct] If anyone is being whimsical, they will never be liberated. //Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo.// Find out this verse.

**Devotee:**
//Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ.//

**Devotee:**
[indistinct discussion with another devotee about finding verse]

"Those who are thus bewildered are attracted by demoniac and atheistic views. In that deluded condition, their hopes for liberation, their fruitive activities and their culture of knowledge are all defeated.’"

**Prabhupāda:**
Purport.

**Devotee:**
Purport: "There are many devotees who assume themselves to be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service but at heart do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, as the Absolute Truth. [laughter---at something happening in room?] For them, the fruit of devotional service---going back to Godhead---will never be tasted. Similarly, those engaged in fruitive pious activities and who are ultimately hoping to be liberated from this material entanglement will never be successful either, because they deride the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. In other words, persons who mock Kṛṣṇa are to be understood to be demonic or atheistic. As described in the Seventh Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā,// such demonic miscreants never surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore their mental speculations to arrive at the Absolute Truth bring them to the false conclusion that the ordinary living entity and Kṛṣṇa are one and the same. With such a false conviction, they think that the body of any human being is now simply covered by material nature, and that as soon as one is liberated from this material body there is no difference between God and himself. This attempt to become one with Kṛṣṇa will be baffled because of delusion. Such atheistic and demoniac cultivation of spiritual knowledge is always futile. That is the indication of this verse. For such persons, cultivation of the knowledge in the Vedic literature, like //Vedānta-sūtra// and the //Upaniṣads,// is always baffled.

"It is a great offense, therefore, to consider Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be an ordinary man. Those who do so are certainly derided, because they cannot understand the eternal form of Kṛṣṇa. In the //Bṛhad-viṣṇu-smṛti// it is clearly stated that one who considers the body of Kṛṣṇa to be material should be driven out from all rituals and activities of the //śruti,// and if by chance one sees his face, he should at once take bath in the Ganges to rid himself of infection. People jeer at Kṛṣṇa because they are envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Their destiny is certainly to take birth after birth in the species of atheistic and demoniac life. Perpetually, their real knowledge will remain under delusion, and gradually they will regress to the darkest region of creation." The Most Confidential Knowledge.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Do you consider Gaurasundara’s position that bad right now?

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone’s position is not bad provided he accepts; otherwise he remains perpetually bad. The body’s condition is bad. What is the difficulty to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead [indistinct]? But I do not do that; therefore I shall remain always in bad condition. You accept, then immediately good. One who has accepted this [indistinct], even he is perpetually bad, he is good.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
What is his tendency, you can study. What is his tendency now?

**Govinda dāsī:**
He doesn’t speak very much to me.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Govinda dāsī:**
He doesn’t speak very much to me. I thought perhaps he would speak with you. He is coming back, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
Really? Gradually he can revive. [indistinct] He is intelligent. If he applies his intelligence, life will be successful. That’s all.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Thank you. [devotees offer obeisances] [end]
