So in this way the Ajāmila, he practiced this unfair way of livelihood. //Bandy-akṣaiḥ kaitavaiś cauryair garhitāṁ vṛttim āsthitaḥ// [[books:sb:6:1:22|[SB 6.1.22]]]. So //vṛtti// means livelihood. If one adopts abominable livelihood, there is no, I mean to say, hope of spiritual advancement. Finished, because... We have learned from //Bhagavad-gītā.// Arjuna says Kṛṣṇa, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]: "Kṛṣṇa, You are the Supreme Brahman," //param dhāma,// "the supreme resort of everything, and" //pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān,// "and the supreme pure." So nobody can approach Kṛṣṇa if he's impure. That is not possible. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// still it is said, //yeṣāṁ tu anta-gataṁ pāpam:// "One who is free from all contamination of sinful activities," //yeṣāṁ anta-gataṁ pāpam janānām puṇya-karmaṇām,// "simply engaged in pious activities only," //te,// "such persons," //dvanda-moha-nirmukta,// "without any doubt and duality," //bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ,// "with fixed-up mind, he can become Kṛṣṇa conscious."

So this Ajāmila, he learned all this nonsense, abominable way of livelihood. And therefore his example is given, how he was downtrodden and fallen. Still, by the grace of Nārāyaṇa, how he was elevated, that is the //itihāsa,// history, which is..., Sūta Gosvāmī is citing, how Kṛṣṇa consciousness is powerful. That is the motive of narrating Ajāmila //ūḍha,// delivering Ajāmila. So here it is said, //evaṁ nivasatas tasya lālayānasya tat-sutān.// Everyone is //tat-sutān,// his children. Even one big economic, economist professor, Professor Marshall, he says... I was student of economics, the Marshall book. He says that economic development begins out of family affection. Family affection. That is the basis. That was his understanding, that nobody would work for livelihood unless he is attached in family. That is his proposition. So here he was attached to the family. //Lālayānasya tat-sutān. Ataḥ gṛha-kṣetra sutāpta vittaiḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. Material bondage is that family affection. It is not that one has to give up this procedure. No, that is not. The Vedic civilization is so nice that you accept the platform which is suitable for you: //brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.// The spiritual... These are called //āśrama. Āśrama// means where spiritual culture is practiced. That is called //āśrama.// Perhaps you know this //āśrama// word. //Āśrama// means... It is not a place for sense gratification; it is a place for advancing in Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is //āśrama.//

So there are four //āśramas// for your spiritual cultivation: //brahmacārī, gṛhastha... Gṛhastha// is also //āśrama,// family. That is also //āśrama.// If the //gṛhastha// life is meant for cultivating Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is all right. This is //āśrama. Gṛhastha āśrama,// then retired life, //vānaprastha.// Although //gṛhastha āśrama// is allowed, but not for all the time, that up to the death. No. That is not allowed. After fiftieth year... Twenty-five years to fiftieth year the young man's spirit is there, the sex power is strong, so the //gṛhastha-āśrama// is a concession for satisfying sex, that's all. But not more than fifty years. Then you must give up. That is the //Vedic// civilization. You accept //gṛhastha āśrama.// Up to twenty-fifth year you remain a //brahmacārī,// learn from //guru// how to become //brahmacārī, gurukula. Brahmacārī gurukule vasan dānta,// how to practice self-control, sense control. A //brahmacārī// is forbidden to see even young girl. Even the spiritual master's wife is young... Sometimes spiritual master is considered as mother. //Ādau mātā guru-patnī.// There are seven mothers. So real mother, //ādau mātā. Guru-patnī,// the spiritual master's wife, she is also mother. //Ādau mātā guru-patnī brāhmaṇī.// The wife of a //brāhmaṇa// is mother. Actually every woman is mother. That is moral instruction. //Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu.// Anyone, any woman who is not your wife... Except your wife, every woman is to be considered as mother. This is education.

The nutshell of education is defined by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, that "Who is //paṇḍita,// learned?" So he does not say that one who has passed M.A., Ph.D., D.A.C. No. He doesn't say that. He says, "Any person who has learned to see like this." What is that? //Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu:// "Everyone's wife should be considered..." //Para-dāra. Para// means others' wife. //Mātṛvat,// mother. Therefore the Vedic system is, when we address another woman, "Mother," no other address. "Mother, can I do this? Would you like this?" The address should be "Mother." Practice. This is practice, the //brahmacārī's// practice. He goes to every householder's wife: "Mother, give me some..." Just like this child. If he is taught from the very beginning of his life that "Address all women as mother...," that training. And intermingling with anyone, then it is a different training. That is //brahmacārī.// So //brahmacārī// is taught that how he should behave in society, what is the aim of life. That is //brahmacārī. Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu.//

//Para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat.// And other's property? Just like garbage. Nobody goes, but I have seen. Nowadays garbage is also tackled. I have seen in Hong Kong, one woman is finding out something valuable from the garbage. This is Kali-yuga. It is untouchable, but still, people are trying to get something from the garbage, so downtrodden, this Kali-yuga. So //mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat, ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu:// "All other living entities think like yourself." That means your pains and pleasure, as you feel, you should take up others' pains and pleasure, not that you protect yourself from all danger and you cut the throat of the poor animals on the plea that it has no soul. This is not education. This is education, that whether the animal has soul or not soul, we shall consider later on. But when knife is on my throat I cry, and he also cries. Why shall I say that "It has no soul, and let me kill it"? So that means he does not know how to see other living entities like himself. Buddha philosophy is based on this, that "Whatever you feel, pain, you should not inflict to others." This is education. //Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat ātmavat.//

So this is moral education, and in the //śāstra// it is also said that there are seven mothers.

> ādau mātā guru-patnī
> brāhmaṇī rāja-patnikā
> dhenur dhātrī tathā pṛthvī
> sapteti mātarī smṛta

Real mother and //guru-patnī,// the wife of spiritual master or teacher... //Ādau mātā guru-patnī, brāhmaṇī,// the wife of a //brāhmaṇa.// And //rāja-patnikā,// the queen, she is also mother, //rāja... Dhenu,// cow. //Dhenur dhātrī,// nurse. //Dhenur dhātrī tathā pṛthvī,// as well as the earth. Earth is mother because they are giving us so many things---fruit, flowers, grains for our eating. Mother gives for eating. Cow gives us milk. This is sense.

But if one becomes addicted to prostitute-hunting then he will be fallen. That is the example. Then he'll become thief, rascal, cheater, drunkard and so on, so on, so on. Why? Now, only for maintaining the family. The family maintenance... The cats and dogs, they also do; the birds also do. But they do not do anything unnatural. A bird maintains his children, brings some fruit or something in the mouth and puts into the mouth of the small kiddies. So that is natural. But why one should take unfair means for maintaining family? This is culture. This is culture. So, but nowadays they have manufactured: "Necessity has no law. I require money, so somehow or other I must have it. Let me adopt this means, that means." No.

So //evaṁ nivasatas tasya lālayānasya.// The //lālayānasya tat-sutān.// So without understanding what is the duty of human being, because he is fallen, so we should not bother for maintaining our family and children till the time of death. No. Up to twenty-five years. A //brahmacārī// is trained to refrain from sex life. That is //brahmacārī,// celibacy. But if he is still not able, then he is allowed to accept //gṛhastha// life. There is no cheating, hypocrisy, that I proclaim myself as //brahmacārī// or //sannyāsī,// and I secretly do all nonsense. This is hypocrisy. The hypocrisy life will not make one advance in spiritual life. That is the example given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. His personal associate you know, Choṭa Haridāsa, Junior Haridāsa. He was very nice singer, so he was singing in the assembly of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And one day he went to beg some rice from Śikhi Mahiti's sister, and there was a young woman, and he lustfully saw there. That is sometimes natural. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu understand that. Just to teach us, while He was eating, He said, "Who brought this rice?" "Choṭa Haridāsa." "So ask him not to see Me anymore. Finish." Everyone was surprised: "What happened?" Then by inquiry it was found that he lustfully saw one young woman. So just... Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so strict that He rejected him from His associates. Then other big, big devotees requested him that "He has committed some mistake, and please excuse him. He is Your servant." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "All right, then you bring him back. You live with him. I am leaving this place. I am leaving this place." They said, "No, sir, we shall not raise this question anymore."

So when this Choṭa Haridāsa found it impossible to again go into the assembly of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he found it hopelessness. Then he went to Triveṇī and committed suicide. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu knows everything. Then, sometimes after, He inquired, "What about Choṭa Haridāsa?" Somebody said, "Sir, You rejected him. Out of disappointment, he has committed suicide in the..." "Oh, that's nice." Just see how strict. "That's nice." He never expect[?] any..., any sympathy: "Oh, I rejected this person and he has committed suicide? Oh." No. He said, "Oh, that's nice. That's all right." He said like that. This is one thing.

Another thing: Śivānanda, one of His very exalted devotee, he was taking care of all devotees who were coming to Caitanya Mahāprabhu to visit during Ratha-yātrā. So his wife came and offered Caitanya Mahāprabhu obeisances, and he saw that the wife is pregnant. So immediately asked, "Śivānanda, your wife is pregnant?" "Yes". "All right, when she gives birth to a child, you keep his name like that." Now see. One man, simply he saw with lusty desire to a young man [woman]; he was rejected. And one man has his wife pregnant; He adored him: "That's all right." So sex life is not forbidden in this movement, but hypocrisy is forbidden. If you become hypocrite, then there is nowhere to... That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. Choṭa Haridāsa, he presented himself as a //brahmacārī// and he was looking after a young woman. Then He understood, "He is a hypocrite. Reject him." And Śivānanda Sena, he was //gṛhastha. Gṛhastha// must have children. What is wrong there? He said, "Yes, my remnants of foodstuff should be given." This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement.

So our request is, don't be hypocrite. There are four //āśramas: brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.// Whichever //āśrama// is suitable for you, you accept. But sincere. Don't be hypocrite. If you think that you want sex, all right, you marry and remain like a gentleman. Don't be hypocrite. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement. He did not like hypocrisy. Nobody likes. But for a person who is seriously engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, for him sex life and material opulence is not very good. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's opinion. //Pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava..., niṣkiñcanasya bhajanonmukhasya, pāraṁ param...// Therefore voluntarily Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted //sannyāsa.// He was very nicely situated in His family life. When He was family man, He married twice. One wife died; He married again. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught us not to become... But when He took //sannyāsa,// He was very, very strict. No woman could come very near to Him. From distance. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching.

So you have to follow strictly the rules and regulation. If you are serious, then this is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement.

> niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya
> pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya
> viṣayināṁ sandarśanam atha yoṣitāṁ ca
> ha hanta hanta viṣa-bhakṣanato 'py asādhu
> [[books:cc:madhya:11:8|[Cc. Madhya 11.8]]]

Those who are determined that "In this life we shall finish this material way of life, or material..." That is real struggle for existence. Actually, everyone is trying. Material life means it is full of distress, //duḥkhālayam.// Kṛṣṇa says. So, so long you'll prolong this material way of life, that is called struggle for existence. The "struggle for existence" and "survival of the fittest," this word is very common, but nobody knows what is that struggle for existence and what is the platform of becoming fittest. Nobody knows. It is we are preaching that "If you remain in this material world, then struggle for existence will continue." And fittest means one who has come to the spiritual platform, he is fittest to survive. What is survival? Who is going to survive? Do you mean to say by cultivating health culture, very strong, you'll survive? Nobody will survive. So who will survive? Only Kṛṣṇa conscious. If he is strictly Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he will survive. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. The Kṛṣṇa conscious person who has studied Kṛṣṇa only, nothing more, perfectly, then he is fit. This body also, this body is not permanent. That's a fact. But //tyaktvā deham,// after giving up this body, no more material body; spiritual body, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1].

So we should be very serious. We should not fall down from the standard of Vedic culture. If you are actually serious about stopping this... //Manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. This is struggle for existence. In this material world everyone is struggling to survive. But who is surviving? That way, materialistic way of life, will not help you to survive. That is... //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. Nature is so strong that you must die. "I am very strong." You may be very strong, that's all right, but you must. There is a, I mean to say, joking story that one man thought, "How to avoid death?" Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu. So he thought that "Yamarāja is the superintendent of death. He comes to take, so I shall make such policy that he may not come to me." What is that policy? "So bring some stool. I shall smear over my body, and out of bad smell, he'll not come." [laughter] So he began to smear stool on his body at the time of death. So this is going on. They are making body very stout and strong so they'll survive. Nobody will survive, sir, unless he is Kṛṣṇa conscious.

Thank you very much.
