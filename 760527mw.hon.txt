**Prabhupāda:**
//Sarva-yoniṣu.// All kinds of forms of life, 8,400,000 different forms of life. So "The material nature is the mother and I am the seed-giving father." Why they do not accept this philosophy? And everything is going on. Just like in the family the mother is there and the father is there. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is the father, and material nature is the mother, and we are all sons. If we accept this simple philosophy, everything will be all right. Why they do not accept this philosophy, so many rascal philosophers? This simple philosophy. And this is a fact. What is this body? This body is this earth. "Dust thou art, dust thou be-est." So the mother is this material nature. I've got this body. And the father, He is Kṛṣṇa, or God. What is wrong in accepting this philosophy? If this simple philosophy is accepted, the whole world will be happy. But they'll not accept it. These rascals will come and speculate rascal philosophy. [laughing] With this simple philosophy... The United Nations is there. Why do they not accept this simple philosophy? If God is the supreme father and in every religion they accept that, at least the Christian religion accept that supreme father, God, and the material nature is the mother, and we are all sons. Not only human beings, but every living being, even the dogs. This is philosophy, real philosophy. Is that all right?

**Śukadeva:**
The philosophy now is that God is dead.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah? Father may be dead, but that does not mean the sons are also dead. Father is dead. This father is not dead. That is another rascaldom.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
People might say the philosophy is very good theoretically, but practically speaking, people...

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not practical? Why not practical?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
People are very greedy in this material world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then with these greedy, rascal, rogue, then how you can be happy? Huh? Needs to be punished only.

**Hari-śauri:**
Therefore Marx said that that greed could be got rid of if everybody worked for the state.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Hari-śauri:**
If everybody pooled their resources.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why state?

**Hari-śauri:**
Well, the state is the ultimate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Take the whole world. You have got United Nation; why you are busy about the state?

**Hari-śauri:**
Well, his idea was that Communism should be spread everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is communism. First of all, you accept one father, or the whole world is father's property, and every living being has a right to enjoy the father's property. Why you are thinking "This portion is Russian," "This portion is American"? It is father's property. So if there is rush in China or India, why not allow them to come to Russia or America? "No. That is my property." What is this philosophy? A father's property, everyone has got right to enjoy the father's property. Can this rascal Marx propose communism on this basis? The animals should be slaughtered. Do the father like that if this son is useless, it cannot do any service, so another big son says, "I'll finish him"? The father will like that? So where is that communism? All selfish motive, that's all. Rascals. And devils citing scripture, philosophy. Rascal citing philosophy. He's a rascal. Let him accept that God is... First of all his business is "No God." His only business is "No God." First of all, mother, father is no needed, that's all.

**Hari-śauri:**
Like that Comte that we were doing...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone, all rascals are thinking like this.

**Hari-śauri:**
He was saying that God's existence is imaginary; man is reality, man is supreme.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because your..., you cannot... Just like our Alfred Ford, he never saw Henry Ford. Then why he says that "I'm the great-grandson of Mr. Ford"? Ford is not there, but why he's claiming Ford's property? Where is Ford? The great-grandson is not expected to see the original establisher of the family. But if there is no philosophy, how they can, any philosophers, all meat-eaters, drunkards, [laughs] woman hunters, and they can be philosophers. [laughs] They're dogs, simply barking. That's all. Simply dogs.

**Śukadeva:**
They say that our philosophy is nice if we can get everyone to follow it, but we will never...

**Prabhupāda:**
Why shall I follow? Why shall I follow? You are limited. Why should I follow your philosophy?

**Śukadeva:**
They say that...

**Prabhupāda:**
They say..., they can say all nonsense, but I have to say something. You accept God the central point, then I accept you. Why you are making state? Then I'll say "I have got my state," then there is fight---American, Russia. That's all.

**Śukadeva:**
People read these philosophies, and they think that they will get knowledge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Knowledge means misguiding knowledge. That's all. That is not knowledge. That is going on. In the name of knowledge, all rascaldom is going on. That is the misfortune of the present world. In the name of knowledge, all rascal "isms" going on. That's all. If we accept... After all, somebody is the Supreme Lord, so He's the father. Why don't you accept that? What is the difficulty?

**Śukadeva:**
The difficulty is that they feel that there's no one that we have to answer to.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah?

**Śukadeva:**
They feel that there's actually no, there, there's no... First of all, there's no laws, there's no natural laws we have to follow.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Then why you are dictating laws, philosophy? That is the [indistinct], chaotic, no laws. Why you are dictating your laws, that we should be communistic, this will be capitalistic, this will be socialistic? Why you are dictating? Let there be no law, as the uncivilized man does.

**Hari-śauri:**
Well, there should be law, but that law is dictated by man.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah?

**Hari-śauri:**
That law is decided by man in accordance with his...

**Prabhupāda:**
Man will dictate law according to his own convenience. Well what about the trees? They are also living entity. You are cutting the tree and making him ugly, because they have no voice to protest. So why man should be given the chance? [break]

**Śukadeva:**
...both agreed that most people think that if it's very confusing, and if their philosophy is very contradictory, then it's very profound. They think that if a philosophy is confusing...

**Prabhupāda:**
Jugglery.

**Śukadeva:**
...or contradictory, then it is...

**Prabhupāda:**
The word is jugglery. The word is jugglery. If you present something with jugglery of words, "Oh, it is very deep thought." [laughter]

**Śukadeva:**
Because they could not understand it, they think that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody will understand.

**Hari-śauri:**
Use some big words and don't make any clear points. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
That [speaking something in a run-on fashion, as a made-up very long word] [laughter] Put some words. [repeats it again] Is there any meaning? [laughter] You hear some jugglery of words. [laughter] They present like that. [repeats in run-on fashion again] What is the meaning of [repeats phrase]?

**Śukadeva:**
They will think that "Because I'm not very advanced, I cannot understand their philosophy."

**Prabhupāda:**
They may think it, but my point is don't be misled by these rascals. Fix up your conviction to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is wanted. Don't be misled by these rascals. [aside:] There is no covering? What you have brought? [break] God is not dead. [indistinct] God is coming to kick you and kill you. God is not dead. He'll come in due course of time and kill you. God is not dead; he'll be dead. That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā: mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]. He's thinking God is dead... "Yes, yes, I'm coming. Whatever asset you've got, I'll take everything and make it killed. Then you'll understand what is God." These rascals say like that. Kṛṣṇa says, //mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham,// "I'll take everything. Just wait a few years more." When you'll not be able to say "God is dead," you are dead. Rascals. "God is dead!"

**Hari-śauri:**
Like Volte. He was eating his own stool and urine before he died, and he was still insisting there is no God.

**Prabhupāda:**
So these rascals, they'll be taught lesson at the time of death. God is not dead; you are dead. You simply wait to see how you are dead. We don't want to discuss all this nonsense philosophy, just to warn our men that "You don't be misled by this rascalism." That is my point. [break] And then who kills you? Who has killed your father? Just see point. Who has killed your father, and who will kill you? Just wait a few years more.

**Śukadeva:**
They say this is accident. This is a philosophy, this is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That action was created by God. That accident was created by God.

**Hari-śauri:**
Also, a cartoon somebody put in the paper, and it shows...

**Prabhupāda:**
They'll accept accident, but not God. Just see his intelligence. He'll accept accident, but not God.

**Śukadeva:**
Most of the philosophers who have this atheistic philosophy, most of them are trained...

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore they are suffering. Why don't you see that? Some of them dying by eating their own stool?

**Śukadeva:**
Actually, at the end of his life, he attained some disease, and he went literally crazy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Disease already there. Old age is already there. That means God is there. They're being punished, but they are so shameless they'll not accept the truth. Same thing. //Vihāya.// They're being punished every moment, every step, "No, God is not dead." All right. Wait a few years more, God will show either you are dead or He's dead. [laughing]

**Hari-śauri:**
I saw this picture once that somebody had drawn. There's a man holding a sign saying "God is dead," and there's a big hand squashing him on the floor, it's coming from the sky, it's squashing him on the floor, and his sign's up on the side saying "God is dead."

**Devotee (1):**
They say that actually there never was any God, it's just a belief in God they had. [break]

**Śukadeva:**
...revolutionary questions that you were asking, because they never stop to ask... They say that you can't accept any philosophy, why are they giving their philosophy? No one ever stops to ask that question.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Everyone is rascal. Therefore I say all rascals. They have no sense. If you want to impose your philosophy, why shall I not impose my philosophy? I've got the same right. Why shall I accept your philosophy?

**Śukadeva:**
Philosophers are saying that there's no philosophy, but they're giving their philosophy. They should...

**Prabhupāda:**
If there's no philosophy, why you rascal propose some philosophy? Stop talking. [laughter]

**Devotee (1):**
No philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is better. That is better. [break] ...your philosophy, that's all right. There is no struggle. So why you trying to pose your philosophy?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Philosophers think they know what is best for everyone else, but they don't even know what is best for themselves.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...presented by Sanātana Gosvāmī before Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

**Hari-śauri:**
Hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
"Everyone says that I am very learned man, but I am so learned that I do not know what I am. I'm so learned." //Vyavahāre kahaye paṇḍita satya kari māni, āpanāra hitāhita kichui...// [[books:cc:madhya:20:100|[Cc. Madhya 20.100]]]. This is admission of foolishness.

**Hari-śauri:**
His first question was, "Tell... Please tell me who I am."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They do not know who he is, and he's philosophizing. Calendar... Calendar? Is criticizing needle?

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh, colander.

**Prabhupāda:**
Colander.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Full of holes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Hole is used for straining, so many holes...

**Prabhupāda:**
He has so many holes, and he's criticizing needle, "Oh, you have got a hole." [Bengali] [break] These rascal, they do not know whether he's this body or something other than body, and they're philosopher. The basic principle of knowledge is lacking, and they're philosopher. Cheater.

**Devotee (1):**
They say at the time of death they will learn a lesson. But if, when they go into a new body, they forget, how will it help them?

**Prabhupāda:**
Forgetful does not mean that they... Suppose this child, he's hurt, and when he'll be grown up he may forget. But that means... That does not mean that he was not hurt.

**Devotee (1):**
Hmm. [break]

**Śukadeva:**
...for devotees, then they have no right to claim that they are philosophers or scientists.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad guṇāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. If one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he has no knowledge. He's a rascal, immediately. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. This is the definition given by... If he's not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's immediately miscreant, rascal and lowest of the mankind. [break] ...may say that he has passed M.A., Ph.D., D.A.C. and he's a philosopher. But we..., our test is whether he's God conscious. If not, he's a rascal. That's all. Immediately.

**Hari-śauri:**
No good qualities.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Reject immediately. [break]

**Śukadeva:**
...Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that we actually don't believe that they're fools.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Śukadeva:**
I said our difficulty is that we don't actually believe that they're fools. Most people are thinking that the scientists do have knowledge. We don't fully believe that they are rascals.

**Prabhupāda:**
You do not believe because you are also fool, rascal. [laughs] That means you're also rascal.

**Śukadeva:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you be intelligent. You're learning from your spiritual master. [break] //...gurum eva abhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. Therefore one must approach a //guru// to learn everything rightly. This is Vedic injunction. //Tat tvaṁ puruṣam eva, ācāryopāsanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.8]]]. Read //Bhagavad-gītā. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda. Ācāryopāsanam.// This process of knowledge is to worship //ācārya.// Who has got //ācārya,// he knows. //Ācāryavān puruṣo veda// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.14.2].

**Śukadeva:**
They accuse that when we take to some religious process, that it's a process of brainwashing.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not a question of religious process. You must know things as they are. Religion is... Religion is that, because religion means to know the real law. That is religion. Not... Religion does not mean sentiment. Religion means to know the real law. That is religion. If you do not know the definition of religion, this is it. Religion means to know the real law, how this world is going on, what is the law. That is religion. Religion is not a sentiment. They have made it a kind of faith. You may have some faith, but the law is different. So faith, a dogmatic faith, is not religion. To know the real law, this is definition of religion. [break] //...vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.// If you know that law, then everything is revealed to you. That is religion. Religion means not a blind rascal. Religion means he knows everything. That is religion. This is the Vedic injunction. //Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati// [//Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// 1.3]. Just like we are talking with so many philosophers. It does not mean that I am scientist, philosopher, everything. No. We know one thing, Kṛṣṇa, immediately we can catch up what is the defect.

**Hari-śauri:**
It's very surprising to people how we have such a wide scope of knowledge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Immediately catch up, "Here is the rascal." //Sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.// If you simply know Kṛṣṇa, you know everything. That is religion.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
People sometimes can't understand why we are not satisfied that someone has some religious sentiment, even though their knowledge of God may be wrong.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sentiment, there is... Even your relationship with your friends and father and mother is sentiment. That is another thing. But you must know, "He's my father," "He's my mother," "He's my son." Sentiment there is, even your ordinary relationship. Just see. You cannot avoid sentiment. Just like we're dancing. That is also sentiment, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa." That is sentiment. But that does not mean because he's dancing in sentiment, he does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. Sentiment must be there. That is ecstasy, enjoyment. But not blind sentiment. [break] ...you do not know, know from Kṛṣṇa. Anybody can say, "I do not know who is my father." And if the real father says, "I'm your father, my son," then how he can prove? How he does not know? If he says, "No, I don't believe you that you are my father," then what is the..., where is evidence?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
He's lost.

**Prabhupāda:**
The mother also says, "Yes, he's your father." "No, I don't believe." What is the evidence? The father is saying, "I am father." The mother is saying, "Yes, he's your father." And the rascal is saying, "No, I don't believe it." Then?

**Hari-śauri:**
You can't do anything for them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see his unfortunate position. Where is his [indistinct]?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They will want to know, though, how this will stop two countries from blowing each other up.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They will want to know how this knowledge that God is the father of everyone will stop these modern-day nations from blowing each other up.

**Prabhupāda:**
That you do, and suffer.

[in car] God is the father, and father's property is this whole world. We are all sons, beginning from Brahmā down to the ant, and father's property lets us enjoy equally. That's all. All questions are solved.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
What to do with the greedy people in the world, though?

**Prabhupāda:**
Greedy because you are meant to... Because you don't recognize father and father's property, you have created the situation.

**Hari-śauri:**
Because they don't know who the proprietor is, they're thinking, "I can take this for myself."

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore America has so much over-production. Let the hungry men come here. Greediness is not allowed. Whatever... //Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. This is //śāstra.// Everything belongs to God. Whatever He allots to you, you take it. In the family the father says, "My dear boy, take of this." That's all. Why should he claim more? The father knows how much he'll eat, and he'll give him. He's supplying the elephant his food, the ant his food. Elephant is not dying, starvation. Why you are bothering? You want to eat forty kilos: "All right. Take it." The father is able to supply that. //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. He's supplying everyone. [break]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
...not a practical solution.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is the knowledge, real knowledge. Eight million, four hundred thousand forms of life, and the supreme father is supplying food to everyone. And each form millions, millions. You'll find millions of one type of fish within the water. And there are nine hundred thousand different forms of fishes. They are eating within this water. Who is supplying them food? We cannot imagine even what is the food there within the water. But there is. Otherwise, how they are living? They have no scarcity.

**Hari-śauri:**
Neither there's any overpopulation, either.

**Prabhupāda:**
Neither. Overpopulation, the fish, they lay eggs hundreds and thousands at a time. You know that? There is not... Unlimited number of eggs they lay down. [break] ...say, "Your food is ready. Just little work." //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Just produce food grains. Everyone will be happy. But why they are producing motorcars only?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
So they can go to the market and get the food. So they can drive to the market.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why market? You can produce your food at home.

**Hari-śauri:**
They have so much land, and then they grow a crop that they don't need...

**Prabhupāda:**
I have estimated if land lying vacant, if they used for farming, producing food, ten times as many people can be fed.

**Hari-śauri:**
Easily.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no question of scarcity. Your American government, "Oh, don't produce, don't produce, don't produce." If they'll produce more, "I'll throw it in the sea." "Produce motorcar. Produce motorcar, 1967 model. Don't produce food grains." This is government's position. Don't produce foodgrains, produce 1967 motorcar, so that there may be more and more accidents.

**Hari-śauri:**
They pay the farmers not to grow crops.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Just see. Why not produce enough? There are so many people starving, they have no land to produce food. Therefore the supreme father has to be accepted.

**Hari-śauri:**
Just like when we were in Fiji, all they grow is sugarcane, so they have to sell the sugarcane to get money to buy crops that they could have grown there in the first place.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, business. Why so much sugarcane? The islands of Hawaii, they grow more sugarcane. We have seen all the islands. Everywhere, huge quantity of sugarcane. The sugarcane is required for manufacturing wine. [break] ...diabetes... [break] ...drink tea. He's much [indistinct] of sugar, and from molasses, they manufacture wine. Unnecessary things. Misadjustment and they're philosophizing.

**Hari-śauri:**
Even when they try to grow the grains, they can't guarantee it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Hari-śauri:**
Like in Russia, they projected that they would grow so much grains...

**Prabhupāda:**
Nature will punish them. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. Nature is Lord's vigilant maintainer. He's observing, as soon as he disobeys the orders of God it will be...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Excuse me. Just like, say, America takes up this idea that God is the supreme father and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I say to you, you say, "In God we trust."

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
We trust. Just... Don't trust blindly. Try to understand what is God. That I am... Letter on, I have not received any reply.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Not yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He, American people, intelligent people, you say, "In God we trust." That's very nice, but why you take this philosophy blindly? Find out who is God and why you should trust. That is intelligence. The slogan is nice. Why don't you fight on this issue, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement? You can fight on this issue. Intelligently, if we'll put, they will recognize. [indistinct]. We trust in God, but what is God? Eh? Hayagrīva? They like to trust in God. Then ask them what is God. Why they cannot reply.

**Hayagrīva:**
They would say the Christian conception of God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Any conception. God is not Christian, not Hindu, not...

**Hayagrīva:**
They would say, "God is the Almighty Father."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. [break] [end]
