**Prabhupāda:**
"...afraid of me, what kind of child? [laughs] Where you got so much strength?" And the answer here,

> na kevalaṁ me bhavataś ca rājan
> sa vai balaṁ balināṁ cāpareṣām
> pare 'vare 'mī sthira-jaṅgamā ye
> brahmādayo yena vaśaṁ praṇītāḥ
> [[books:sb:7:8:7|[SB 7.8.7]]]

"Prahlāda Mahārāja said, 'My dear King, the source of my strength, of which you are asking, is also the source of yours, by which you are challenging. Indeed, the original source of all kinds of strength is one. He is not only your strength or mine, but the only strength for everyone. Without Him, no one can get any strength, whether moving or not moving, superior or inferior. Everyone, including Lord Brahmā, is controlled by the strength of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.' "

> so 'haṁ vikatthamānasya
> śiraḥ kāyād dharāmi te
> gopāyeta haris tvādya
> yas te śaraṇam īpsitam
> [[books:sb:7:8:13|[SB 7.8.13]]]

"All right, let me see how your strength is coming. Now I shall kill you. Come on. Let me see [laughs] how your God is coming to save you." This is atheism, challenging. And when He appeared, the Hiraṇyakaśipu became a fly [laughs] in front of... Eh? Where is such language? Even there are many Sanskrit scholars now, they cannot produce such language. That is not possible. And five thousand years before, Vyāsadeva presented this unique language.

**Rāmeśvara:**
This is the twentieth volume of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// now printed. Twentieth volume.

**Prabhupāda:**
Number twenty.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// series.

**Prabhupāda:**
Out of sixty. Still forty.

**Rāmeśvara:**
So you have already finished two more volumes at least.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, say...

**Rāmeśvara:**
Prabhupāda says out of sixty volumes, twenty are already printed, and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Twenty already printed, and two or three ready for being printed.

**Hayagrīva:**
But this is the bulk of the cantos, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Rāmeśvara:**
No, Tenth Canto will be very long.

**Hayagrīva:**
The Tenth...

**Prabhupāda:**
Tenth Canto will be like //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// fifteen volumes, Tenth Canto. Generally six chapters a volume, eh?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Depending on the size.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, generally. So there are ninety chapters. That means minimum fifteen volumes, and maybe more. We have presented //Kṛṣṇa// book, just a summary study, not explained. But when it will be explained, with each and every //śloka,// purport, then it will be not less than fifteen volumes. Tenth Chapter is the face of the Lord. We have described the legs, hands, belly, that's all, and Tenth Chapter is the face, smiling face. Therefore we should not jump over the face all at once. It must go from the legs, gradually, and then face, then forehead, then hair. Eleventh, Twelfth, Twelfth Chapter, finished, the whole body of Kṛṣṇa. Hmm. So thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

**Rāmeśvara:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? We'd like to put... We have got in some other copies, and we would like to put them on the altar tonight for //sandhyā ārati.// These two are your copies.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, take it.

**Rāmeśvara:**
But those two are for Your Divine Grace. We have others to show the Deities.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. All right, do it.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja, how you are keeping your health?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Pretty good.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's... And things are going nice?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes. The devotees are all anxious for you, to see.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And Hayagrīva Mahārāja is being forced? [laughs]

**Hayagrīva:**
You should cane me more, Śrīla Prabhupāda

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Kṛṣṇa is very cunning.

**Hayagrīva:**
I know. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
[still laughing] One may try to leave Him, but He is not going to leave you. Once come, "No, sir, you cannot go out." Just like our Ajāmila. He was devotee in the beginning, and later on, by bad association of prostitute, he fell. But Kṛṣṇa took him at the end. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]]. Kṛṣṇa gave him chance to give him a son. He kept the son's name Nārāyaṇa. So on account of affection of the son, he was chanting, "Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa." Just Kṛṣṇa is so kind that [laughs] "All right, this rascal is going out of My hand. All right, give him a child, Nārāyaṇa. He will chant, 'Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa,' and that will be his credit." //Ajñāta-sukṛti. Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:70|[Cc. Madhya 8.70]]]. //Sukṛti,// pious activities, of many millions of birth is not equal to love of Godhead. //Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate. Tatra laulyam ekalaṁ mūlyaṁ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate. Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā-matiḥ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate// [Padyavali 14]: "Purchase Kṛṣṇa consciousness anywhere it is available." What is the price? //Tatra laulyam ekalaṁ mūlyam:// "Only greediness, hankering. That is the price." "Oh, that I have got." "No, no. //Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate.// You cannot obtain this price even after millions of births' pious activities." All right.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. //Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
