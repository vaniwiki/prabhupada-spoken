**Prabhupāda:**
That is his blessing. He wanted; I tried. That's all. Whatever is being done, it is by his desire. //Vaiṣṇava sata saṅkalpa.// Whatever he desires, that is to be fulfilled. //Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau// [//ŚU// 6.23]. Therefore, full faith in //guru,// that is the prime factor of success. Not any other things, no qualification, no education, only staunch faith in //guru. Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau. Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ.// This is the secret. So whatever little success is there, that was only this qualification, that I wanted to serve him. That's all. Otherwise, there was no business of coming here at the age of seventy years.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
No one could imagine that.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have seen all my room in the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
We looked through the cracks. They're usually not open. Very inspiring.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Rādhā-vallabha has one newspaper article when you had just arrived in, I think, Butler.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Trivikrama brought it up last..., two nights ago.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
When you had just arrived, I think before going to New York, and you were being interviewed, and it said the Swami is welcoming lectures, and... What was it?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I don't remember the exact words.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
It was very inspiring for us.

**Prabhupāda:**
The Butler picture?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Another paper was there: "Ambassador of India's culture."

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Ambassador.

**Hari-śauri:**
Was that the one you have?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes, that was the same article, it's in the //Butler Eagle.// It shows a photograph of you looking through one of your books.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Many times the devotees lament that we could not have been there to help you, because there was so much service.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you are helping me.

[pause]

**Baradrāj:**
[looking at flower] Who can create such fragrance except Kṛṣṇa? [devotees laugh] Fragrance is coming from here, from the dirt, muddy dirt, and fragrance is coming. Unless there is fragrance, how it came here? The color is coming, the beauty is coming, the fragrance is coming, the arrangement is coming along the stem. Where is that scientist? They have seen every day, and "There is no God." Just see, how foolish they are. You do it.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
In the future.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] That is another bluff.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Post-dated check.

**Prabhupāda:**
Even if you do in future, what is credit? It is already done by somebody.

**Hari-śauri:**
They're just copying.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
They can create fragrance: simply the bad smell of their bodies.

**Prabhupāda:**
"In future." They're competing with God, and without being success. Still: "I am God." What kind of God you are? And foolish men have no sense; they accept such rascals as God. They do not see what is God. How beautiful flowers, how nice arrangement. You cannot manufacture even one fiber, and still you deny God. //Mūḍha.// He's speaking, //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]: "Under My supervision everything is being done." And you have got experience that unless one supervises, nothing can be done very nicely. So these things are being done under some expert supervision. This part is green, and this part it is red. Two colors are being transferred, transmitted. The flavor is not here, but here. What is this arrangement? There is no brain?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Superintelligence.

**Prabhupāda:**
And still the rascals say there is no God.

**Hari-śauri:**
"Just chance."

**Prabhupāda:**
No, what a fool they are. Try to expose these fools. But people have lost their reason, brain, everything. Even if we expose, they cannot understand. Still they will stick.

**Bahulāśva:**
What is their hope?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hope, last hope is to kill them. [makes loud sound with hand or instrument]

**Baradrāj:**
Chopping off their...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kalki-avatāra.// No more teacher, saintly. With sword, cut. Finish. Wholesale massacre. Being killed by God, they get salvation.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Even for doing nothing.

**Baradrāj:**
What sort of salvation?

**Prabhupāda:**
Salvation? They realize their spiritual identity. //Āpana karama, bhuñjāye śamana, kahoye// [//Gaura-Nityānander Dayā// 4]. //Karma-phala,// result of sinful activities, very, very strong. Prahlāda Mahārāja's prayer. Where is that book?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Which one, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
I think it is Tenth Chapter.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
The beginning of the Tenth Chapter is here.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes, beginning of the Tenth Chapter is here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, what is the first verse? Eighth verse?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Indriyāṇi manaḥ prāṇaḥ// or //yadi dāsyasi me kāmān?//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. The Prahlāda Mahārāja's prayer? See this contents.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
It starts in the Ninth Chapter, his prayers.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Brahmādayaḥ...//

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Read that.

**Hṛdayānanda:**

> śrī-prahrāda uvāca
> brahmādayaḥ sura-gaṇā munayo 'tha siddhāḥ
> sattvaikatāna-gatayo vacasāṁ pravāhaiḥ
> nārādhituṁ puru-guṇair adhunāpi pipruḥ
> kiṁ toṣṭum arhati sa me harir ugra-jāteḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:8|[SB 7.9.8]]]

"Prahlāda Mahārāja prayed: How is it possible for me, who have been born in a family of //asuras,// to offer suitable prayers to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Even until now all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmā, and all the saintly persons could not satisfy the Lord by streams of excellent words, although such persons are very qualified, being in the mode of goodness. Then what is to be said of me? I am not at all qualified."

**Prabhupāda:**
Go on, second.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Purport?

**Prabhupāda:**
No purport. Translation.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Sanskrit also?

**Prabhupāda:**
Or translation. No, Sanskrit also. The //mantra,// hearing, that is very valuable. These are all Vedic //mantras.// If you simply hear, it helps you spiritually.

**Hṛdayānanda:**

> manye dhanābhijana-rūpa-tapaḥ-śrutaujas-
> tejaḥ-prabhāva-bala-pauruṣa-buddhi-yogāḥ
> nārādhanāya hi bhavanti parasya puṁso
> bhaktyā tutoṣa bhagavān gaja-yūtha-pāya
> [[books:sb:7:9:9|[SB 7.9.9]]]

"Prahlāda Mahārāja continued: One may possess wealth, an aristocratic family, beauty, austerity, education, sensory expertise, luster, influence, physical strength, diligence, intelligence and mystic yogic power, but I think that even by all these qualifications one cannot satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, one can satisfy the Lord simply by devotional service. Gajendra did this, and thus the Lord was satisfied with him."

> viprād dvi-ṣaḍ-guṇa-yutād aravinda-nābha-
> pādāravinda-vimukhāt śvapacaṁ variṣṭham
> manye tad-arpita-mano-vacanehitārtha-
> prāṇaṁ punāti sa kulaṁ na tu bhūrimānaḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:10|[SB 7.9.10]]]

"If a //brāhmaṇa// has all twelve of the brahminical qualifications [as they are stated in the book called //Sanat-sujāta//] but is not a devotee and is averse to the lotus feet of the Lord, he is certainly lower than a devotee who is a dog-eater but who has dedicated everything---mind, words, activities, wealth and life---to the Supreme Lord. Such a devotee is better than such a //brāhmaṇa// because the devotee can purify his whole family, whereas the so-called //brāhmaṇa// in a position of false prestige cannot purify even himself."

> tac cātmane prati-mukhasya yathā mukha-śrīḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:11|[SB 7.9.11]]]

"The Supreme Lord, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is always fully satisfied in Himself. Therefore when something is offered to Him, the offering, by the Lord's mercy, is for the benefit of the devotee, for the Lord does not need service from anyone. To give an example, if one's face is decorated, the reflection of one's face in a mirror is also seen to be decorated."

> nīco 'jayā guṇa-visargam anupraviṣṭaḥ
> pūyeta yena hi pumān anuvarṇitena
> [[books:sb:7:9:12|[SB 7.9.12]]]

"Therefore, although I was born in a demoniac family, I may without a doubt offer prayers to the Lord with full endeavor, as far as my intelligence allows. Anyone who has been forced by ignorance to enter the material world may be purified of material life if he offers prayers to the Lord and hears the Lord's glories."

> kṣemāya bhūtaya utātma-sukhāya cāsya
> vikrīḍitaṁ bhagavato rucirāvatāraiḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:13|[SB 7.9.13]]]

"O my Lord, all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmā, are sincere servants of Your Lordship, who are situated in a transcendental position. Therefore they are not like us [Prahlāda and his father, the demon Hiraṇyakaśipu]. Your appearance in this fearsome form is Your pastime for Your own pleasure. Such an incarnation is always meant for the protection and improvement of the universe."

> tad yaccha manyum asuraś ca hatas tvayādya
> modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā
> lokāś ca nirvṛtim itāḥ pratiyanti sarve
> rūpaṁ nṛsiṁha vibhayāya janāḥ smaranti
> [[books:sb:7:9:14|[SB 7.9.14]]]

"My Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva, please therefore cease Your anger now that my father, the great demon Hiraṇyakaśipu, has been killed. Since even saintly persons take pleasure in the killing of a scorpion or a snake, all the worlds have achieved great satisfaction because of the death of this demon. Now they are confident of their happiness, and they will always remember Your auspicious incarnation in order to be free from fear."

**Prabhupāda:**
You are reading the transcription or original verse?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Transcription.

**Prabhupāda:**
So this transcription is quite helpful in pronunciation, everything. Exact it is coming. The diacritic marks follow, you can pronounce exactly. Then?

**Hṛdayānanda:**

> nāhaṁ bibhemy ajita te 'tibhayānakāsya-
> jihvārka-netra-bhrukuṭī-rabhasogra-daṁṣṭrāt
> āntra-srajaḥ-kṣataja-keśara-śaṅku-karṇān
> nirhrāda-bhīta-digibhād ari-bhin-nakhāgrāt
> [[books:sb:7:9:15|[SB 7.9.15]]]

"My Lord, who are never conquered by anyone, I am certainly not afraid of Your ferocious mouth and tongue, Your eyes bright like the sun or Your frowning eyebrows. I do not fear Your sharp, pinching teeth, Your garland of intestines, Your mane soaked with blood or Your high, wedgelike ears. Nor do I fear Your tumultuous roaring, which makes elephants flee to distant places, or Your nails, which are meant to kill Your enemies."

**Prabhupāda:**
Now he'll come to the point in which he's afraid of. Next verse.

**Hṛdayānanda:**

> trasto 'smy ahaṁ kṛpaṇa-vatsala duḥsahogra-
> saṁsāra-cakra-kadanād grasatāṁ praṇītaḥ
> baddhaḥ sva-karmabhir uśattama te 'ṅghri-mūlaṁ
> prīto 'pavarga-śaraṇaṁ hvayase kadā nu
> [[books:sb:7:9:16|[SB 7.9.16]]]

"O most powerful, insurmountable Lord, who are kind to the fallen souls, I have been put into the association of demons as a result of my activities, and therefore I am very much afraid of my condition of life within this material world. When will that moment come when You will call me to the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are the ultimate goal for liberation from conditional life?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Prahlāda Mahārāja is afraid of this material life, not of Nṛsiṁha-deva. Such a fierceful appearance, he knows, "He's my Lord." No fear. But he's afraid of this material existence. //Trasto 'smi,// read it,

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Same verse, or next one?

**Prabhupāda:**
The same verse, //trasto 'smi.//

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Trasto 'smy ahaṁ kṛpaṇa-vatsala duḥsahogra.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Duḥsahogra:// "This material life, the tribulation, it is unbearable for me." //Trasto 'smi, duḥsaha ugra.// Hmm? Then?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Saṁsāra-cakra.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, //saṁsāra-cakra.// Then?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Kadanād grasatāṁ praṇītaḥ, baddhaḥ sva-karmabhir uśattama...//

**Prabhupāda:**
"And when I am put into this condition... Not that I am accusing You. It is due to my own fault," //sva-karmabhiḥ,// "by my own resultant action of //karma.//" Then?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Uśattama te 'ṅghri-mūlam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
"Therefore kindly engage me in Your service." What is the translation?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Of the whole verse?

**Prabhupāda:**
Of this verse, yes.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
"O most powerful, insurmountable Lord, who are kind to the fallen souls, I have been put into the association of demons as a result of my activities, and therefore I am very much afraid of my condition of life within this material world. When will that moment come when You will call me to the shelter of Your lotus feet, which are the ultimate goal for liberation from conditional life?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Is there a purport?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes. "Being in the material world is certainly miserable, but certainly when one is put into the association of //asuras,// or atheistic men, it is intolerably so. One may ask why the living entity is put into the material world. Indeed, sometimes foolish people deride the Lord for having put them here. Actually, everyone is put into conditional life according to his //karma.// Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja, representing all the other conditioned souls, admits that he was put into life among the //asuras// because of the results of his //karma.// The Lord is known as //kṛpaṇa-vatsala// because He is extremely kind to the conditioned souls. As stated in //Bhagavad-gītā,// therefore, the Lord appears when there are discrepancies in the execution of religious principles [//yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata..., tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. The Lord is extremely anxious to deliver the conditioned souls, and therefore He instructs all of us to return home, back to Godhead [//sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Thus Prahlāda Mahārāja expected that the Lord, by His kindness, would call him again to the shelter of His lotus feet. In other words, everyone should be eager to return home, back to Godhead, taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Lord and thus being fully trained in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
Next verse.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Yasmāt priyāpriya-viyoga-saṁyoga-janma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
This is description of this material life. //Yasmāt priyāpriya?//

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Viyoga-saṁyoga-janma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Hṛdayānanda:**

> śokāgninā sakala-yoniṣu dahyamānaḥ
> duḥkhauṣadhaṁ tad api duḥkham atad-dhiyāhaṁ
> bhūman bhramāmi vada me tava dāsya-yogam
> [[books:sb:7:9:17|[SB 7.9.17]]]

Translation? "O great one, O Supreme Lord, because of combination with pleasing and displeasing circumstances and because of separation from them, one is placed in a most regrettable position, within heavenly or hellish planets, as if burning in a fire of lamentation. Although there are many remedies by which to get out of miserable life, any such remedies in the material world are more miserable than the miseries themselves."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. [laughs] You want to mitigate some misery, and the process is still more miserable. Is it not?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are trying to solve one problem, but creating another hundreds of problems.

**Baradrāj:**
What are some of the examples?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Baradrāj:**
What is some example of that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like you create a motorcar for easy transportation, and you have experience: the power problem, the accident problem. If there is no power problem, you get more petrol, and you commit more accident. And you stop car, then there is..., you are unable to move, because you now you have created city. If you want to go to consult a doctor, you have to go thirty miles from your residence. You require doctor, but because you have now car, you have big, big roads. So your doctor, medical consultant, is living thirty miles off. So you have to ride on cars to go to the market, to go to the office, to go to the medical man. So car is required. And as soon car is there, the accident is there, and there is..., power shortage is there, you require big, big roads, so on, so on, so on.

**Hari-śauri:**
Pollution.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where is the solution of your problem? It has created more problem.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
So village life is best.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the best life. That you develop. It will be an ideal thing. You haven't got to go office fifty miles off. Just get little vegetable and milk, //bās,// your problem is solved. It is practical. Why you should go fifty miles off?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
In New York, to go to work, they go into the subway car, and there are so many people...

**Prabhupāda:**
That... Not only; the ferry, steamer, bus, train, subway, cars, there are so many things. I've seen it. They start for going to the office early in the morning, and they come back at eleven o'clock at night. And few hours, that is their family life. And that hours are wasted by sleeping and by sex. //Bās.// This is their life. And to forget all these miserable conditions, drink. This is civilization.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Horrible.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
My father used to get up very early in the morning to go to work, and he would be so tired from going to work, as soon as he got home, he would just eat and immediately fall asleep. I'd ask him why he was working so hard, he would say, "Simply to support the children." But now he has no more wife, no more children, and he's still working the same.

**Prabhupāda:**
Horrible civilization. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
They say they have no time.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] All right, come to New Vrindavan, we shall give you food. That they won't come.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
They have to work.

**Baradrāj:**
They are afraid of nature.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
So Śrīla Prabhupāda, I'm going back tonight.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why so soon?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
To get ready for your coming.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I think that's all Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja ever thinks of, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I think all Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja ever thinks of is when you are coming.

**Prabhupāda:**
I am also thinking of their fresh vegetable and fresh milk, [devotees laugh] which is not avail...

**Hayagrīva:**
Remember the first time you came out, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Hayagrīva:**
Remember the first time you came? You walked up the road. Our car..., we tried to take you in the car, but it didn't work. It broke. Power wagon.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
It got stuck.

**Prabhupāda:**
All fresh vegetable, fresh milk, this is celestial. Who has got the opportunity in the city? Automatically. [drumming outside]

**Devotee:**
Some kind of parade.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
