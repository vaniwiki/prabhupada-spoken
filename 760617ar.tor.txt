**Prabhupāda:**
I thank you very much for arranging this nice temple in Toronto. So actually, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the basic principle of united nations. Last night two Christian fathers came to see me in Detroit. So we were talking about this movement. So we explained... They were very much satisfied. Actually, this movement is for cleansing the heart. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement is the cleansing the heart. We have simply created misunderstanding on account of material concept of life. We have accepted this body: "I am this body." I am, because I am accepting that I am this body... Accidentally this body was born in India; therefore I am thinking I'm an Indian. Or accidentally the body was born in Canada or in America, I am thinking I'm Canadian or I'm Indian or I'm American. This is created. This is not the actual fact. Actual fact is that I am not this body but I am the spirit soul. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// "I am the spirit soul." This is actual knowledge.

So,

> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

This is the verdict of Vedic literature. Anyone who is thinking that "I am this body," and with reference to the body the family members, the society members or the nation members..., national members---we are expanded---or even international members. But I am not this body. So this kind of thinking is there in the animals also. The animals, the dog is thinking, "I am dog." And it is barking---dog's business. Similarly, if we go to the United Nation and bark like the dog, thinking that "I am this body," then where is the difference between the dog and the human being? Simply barking, you'll distinguish from the animal or the human being? No. Actually, our education should be based on that "I am not this body," //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement. Caitanya Mahāprabhu declared that "I am not a //brāhmaṇa,// I am not a //kṣatriya,// I am not a //gṛhastha,// I am not this or that." Designations. He refused to accept these designations. But He introduced Himself as the servant of the servant of the servant of God, Kṛṣṇa: //gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]].

So if we understand this fact... It is not "I believe," "I think," "Perhaps." No "perhaps," no "thinking," no "believing." It is a fact that I am not this body. Everyone can understand. A man has died; his sons family members crying, "Oh, my father has gone, my father has gone!" Where has your father gone? Here is your father lying down. Why you are crying your father has gone? "No, my father is gone." So that means he never saw his father. He saw the coat-pant of the father, and now it is not moving. The coat-pant is there, but still he says, "My father is gone." This is our misunderstanding. Your father is not this body. The spirit soul which moved the father so long, and you accepted the coat-pant or the body as father, that is your misunderstanding. Father is not this coat-pant or the body. Father is within.

This is the first education of //Bhagavad-gītā,// that within this body the living entity is there. The living entity is there, but the body is changing. The child is becoming boy, the boy is becoming young man, the young man is becoming middle-aged man, middle-aged man becoming old man. The body is changing. We know, every one of us. But I am the same spirit soul. This misunderstanding, that I am not this body, still, I am identifying with this body, this is our ignorance. And so long this ignorance will continue, we shall remain like cats and dogs. There cannot be any peace. It is not possible. When we come to the real understanding that we are spirit soul and part and parcel of God, then we become actually learned.

So people have opened the United Nation, but there is no education about our identity, what I am---whether I am this body or the moving spirit which is moving the body; whether I am that moving spirit or I am this material lump of matter. So it is a great science. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not a sentimental movement, not a bluffing movement, that a man has become God by some mystic power or this... No. It is a science. One has to study. That is, it is called //kṛṣṇa-tattva.// Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means //kṛṣṇa-tattva,// the science of Kṛṣṇa, or the science of God. So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very seriously started this movement, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, to understand the science of Kṛṣṇa very easily. We cannot understand on account of our ignorance. I am not this body, everyone sees practically. Still, he's identifying with this body. This is called ignorance or, in common words, rascaldom. //Mūḍha.// They are called //mūḍhas,// rascals.

So the United Nation, for the last thirty, forty years, they are struggling, but there is no unity of the nations. That is not possible. So long you are in the bodily concept of life, there cannot be any unity. When you actually come to the platform to understand that "I am not this body, I am spirit soul," then there will be... //Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. Then the question of equality, fraternity, justice and everything will come. Unless we do not understand what I am---I misidentify myself with this body---we shall remain in the darkness of the animal. There cannot be any peace and prosperity. That is not possible.

So we have come here in Toronto to open this center to give this enlightenment to everyone. It is not meant for a particular nation, particular religious system. It is a science. Suppose if we say that you become peaceful, you become honest, you become wise. These instructions are not meant for East or West; it is meant for everyone. So our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to educate people how to become wise, honest, truthful, believer in God, so on, so on. This is the movement. So we think that you shall take seriously this movement. Actually, this is the platform of united nation, or united living beings. And we are not simply talking. This science is being discussed in volumes of books. We have already published about fifty-four books. These books are selling very nicely. It is not sentiment, it is a science. So we request the people of this nice city, Toronto, to take advantage of this movement, come here, read our books, make your questions solved, and you'll be all happy. It doesn't matter whether you are Canadian or Indian. It doesn't matter.

Thank you very much. [break] Any question to understand this? If there is any question, you can put. That's all. [end]
