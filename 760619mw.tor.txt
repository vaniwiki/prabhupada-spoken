**Prabhupāda:**
...to live like them, to dance like them, to dress like them, to smoke like them, to stand like them. [laughter]

**Hari-śauri:**
What... //Bara?// That means?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bara-sāb. Bara-sāb//---big master.

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh, big master.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
//Sāhīb// or //sāb?//

**Prabhupāda:**
The word is //sāhīb,// but short cut, //sāb.// [break] ...standing for twelve years here? No.

**Hari-śauri:**
No, he's show-biz, show-business. [break]

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa, good morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] This is modern civilization. Modern [Hindi] //nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛ-loke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. Don't be hogs. Be human beings. This is hog civilization. [Hindi] Sex. Don't care whether he's mother, sister or brother. No, no. This is going on. [long conversation in Hindi with Indians, laughing] [break]

[in car]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...that we have to stick to the tradition. //Tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.// Then... Not just by mystical devotion.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no proper guide. They manufacture ideas, that's all. //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]], that path is not there. [break] ...name? I forgot

**Satsvarūpa:**
Gene. [the priest who joined in LA]

**Prabhupāda:**
Gene.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...building or something...

**Viśvakarmā:**
Yes, it's a very big exhibit, scientific achievements. [break] ...come and see it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...their achievement, no more death? As soon as you ask this question, //matta kara heṭ. Baro baro bagara baro baro pet laṅkā diṅgaya matta kora heṭ.// "Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping, melancholy." [laughs] What scientific advancement? Ask them. Do you think there will be no more death? //Matte kora heṭ:// "Yes, we are trying. Yes." Answer them, "What is your achievement?" All achievement will be, remain in your back, and you'll have to die. So what you have done, insurance, that you'll enjoy this? You'll be kicked out of the scene at any moment. What you have done for this? What is the answer? //Mattaḥ kora heṭ// "Yes, we are trying." [laughter] Nonsense, you are trying. And we have to see this nonsense. We are not so fool. And if they say, "What you are doing?" "Yes, we are doing that. How to conquer over death." //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti, mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. That is we are trying. That is real scientific. Eh? What is method? Very simple: //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru mām evaiśyasi asaṁśayaḥ// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]: "Without any doubt, he comes to Me." This is science. Why shall I waste time? [break]

Svarūpa Dāmodara challenged one scientist in California that "If I give you the chemicals, can you manufacture life?" He said, "That I cannot say." What you have spoken all this nonsense? //Matta kora heṭ.// And when there is challenge, //matta kora heṭ.// Otherwise, //baro baro bagara, baro baro phet,// big, big monkey, big, big belly. And when the real question is there, //matta kora het.// Ceylon jumping, melancholy. Hanumān jumped over the ocean, so other monkeys, they also become very proud: "I am..., Hanumān is our leader. We can...," "Can you jump over Ceylon?" //Matta het.// [break] ...speak all these things, Indian villagers, they will immediately believe. One cobbler... I think I narrated this story. Nārada Muni was going to Vaikuṇṭha. Did I say that?

**Hari-śauri:**
I think this story's in //Rāja-vidyā,// that small book. The one about the //brāhmaṇa// and the cobbler?

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes. Cobbler immediately believed when he was informed by Nārada Muni that "I saw God is pulling one elephant through the hole of a needle, this side and again this side." The //brāhmaṇa// did not believe it. And as soon as the cobbler---he was also devotee---he heard, oh, he began to pray, "Oh, my Lord can do anything." So Nārada Muni, "You believed it?" "Yes, why not?" "How do you believe it?" "I am daily seeing. I am underneath the tree, and so many figs are dropping, and each fig has got thousands of seeds, and in each seed there is another tree. Why should I not believe it?" He did not believe it blindly. With reason. And he gave immediately reason: "When I see this fig tree, big fig tree, and there are millions of figs dropping, and in each fig there are millions of seeds, and each seed there is... Why shall I not believe it?" God, nothing is impossible by God, everything.

**Satsvarūpa:**
The //brāhmaṇa// was supposed to be learned in the //Vedas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes. And he said, "These are all...," what is called? Mythology. Why mythology? Why do you think God like you? God is all-powerful; He can do anything. That is real faith. That means you have no faith. "If God can do which tallies with my activities, then I shall believe." What you are? Nonsense. This is their general argument. How we can believe this? And why not believe this? You are seeing so many wonderful things. I gave this example to another man, that there is a coconut tree. Now find out where is the pipe and pumping so that the water is pushed. Show me. You have no idea that such a high height, how water is going there, and full of water. How the water is transferred there? Show me the pipe and pump. You have got the idea, that with pipe and pump we can raise the water. Where is that pipe and pump? Show me. Every day, every moment, we are seeing so many wonderful things. How you are thinking... "I am Dr. Frog. Pacific Ocean may be four feet. All right, five feet. Make compromise, ten feet." [laughter] Rascal. If you think for many millions of years, then you'll have no solution. //Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo// [Bs. 5.34]. It is not possible in that way. They have no idea of God.

**Hari-śauri:**
Everything is there, but actually they don't see.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they are not devotee. //Paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣā. Mām ebhyaḥ param. Mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ parama-avyayam// [[books:bg:7:13|[Bg. 7.13]]]. //Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ. Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ// [[books:bg:7:24|[Bg. 7.24]]]. They have no knowledge.

**Satsvarūpa:**
They think that if they follow, they'll still be misled. "Why should I believe? It may not be true."

**Prabhupāda:**
But you are already misled. Why not be second time misled? You are already misled, thousand times. Why not try once more? You are making so much arrangement to live comfortably, but you are kicked out. Are you not misled? //Bahir-artha-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. You are thinking that by adjustment of this external energy, you will be able to live very happily. Is it possible? You are trying, problem after problem, problem after problem. So you are already misled.

**Satsvarūpa:**
You've said, "Just give this one life to Kṛṣṇa. You've misgambled so many lives. Why not give one to Kṛṣṇa?"

**Prabhupāda:**
You are misled already so many lives. All right, be misled another life. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].

**Hari-śauri:**
They're taking a photo today for the BTG, so they'd like if you would pose for five minutes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not? [end]
