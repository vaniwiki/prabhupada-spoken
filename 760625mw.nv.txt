[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...they say about the Westerners, you do not know? Don't be sorry. They say //paścime lokā mūla nacaḥ.// The Western people, they are rascals and misbehaved.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
And mis...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Misbehaved.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Misbehaved. That's a fact.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Paścime loka mūla nacaḥ.// This means from India, the farther you go to the western side, you'll find only rascals and misbehaved. From Punjab you go to Afghanistan and then Iran then so on, so on, Europe. These are //paścima,// Western people. //Paścime loka mūla nacaḥ.// Actually he meant it for Indian //paścima,// east and west. You came before here?

**Ṛṣi Kumāra:**
What was that, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
New Vrindavan?

**Ṛṣi Kumāra:**
Yes, I was here, but a long time ago, when they just had the little farm, about six years ago. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
What did he say?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
[reading letter] He's back in Europe. This letter's from Germany. He mentions that he's getting some more buses and about fifteen more men to come, along with some preaching equipment. They plan on leaving early August and are reaching there late August sometime. And so far he mentions that he still has no definite idea how to keep the buses in India, so the other buses will be coming out, and two more buses will be coming in. This is his plan. Then he mentions that he had some correspondence with Lokanātha Swami, who's heading up the traveling party while he's in Europe, and Lokanātha Swami mentions they've been doing //saṅkīrtana// in Dharamshala on the way up to Srinagar, Kashmir. And he says they are doing well everywhere they go.

**Prabhupāda:**
In India, everywhere they'll be received very nice.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
//Prasādam// distribution has now been started as a regular part of the program. And they did one program in a town called Dalilama.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Dalailama.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Immediately two monks and one British hippie joined the party.

**Prabhupāda:**
Two monks means Buddhist monk?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Possibly. And he mentions, "In the last two weeks after we left Vṛndāvana we picked up eight devotees," so they must have more devotees by now. The emphasis on their program, he mentions, is to make devotees and responsible preachers to carry on the Indian mission. And then he says that "We've been advertising."

**Prabhupāda:**
Advertising?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Like this. He says, "I want to make one banner and poster: 'Now you can join the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. Travel all over the world preaching //Bhagavad-gītā.// All expenses paid. Free food, lodging, etc. No qualification necessary. Apply ISKCON.' " It's like army recruiting.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] "No qualification."

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
And he mentions the situation in Germany, at least the devotees are becoming a little stronger now. //Saṅkīrtana// is going on nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. That we want. //Saṅkīrtana// must go on. [break]

**Kīrtanānanda:**
...devotees here now, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where from?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Baltimore, St. Louis, about seven vans from the Rādhā-Dāmodara party, Buffalo, Cleveland. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...occupied by devotees?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...is doing nice.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's a very good boy.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
He's very eager to train up the new men, he mentioned in his last letter.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is devotee. Nasty government. If somebody wants to give donation, a car, not allowed.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Where is this?

**Prabhupāda:**
In India, if you want to give one car donation, they'll not allow. They will charge 220 percent. [laughs] Very nasty government.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Everywhere you go.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Everywhere now is nasty government.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Dasyu-dharma,// rogues and thieves, they'll [indistinct]. Government means people in general, they are losing their independence. Personal independence, nil. Russia, cent percent, no personal independence. Simply like animals who live. [end]
