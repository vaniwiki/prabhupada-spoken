**Hari-śauri:**
[announces] Prabhupāda visits the marble shop. [break]

**Kīrtanānanda:**
This is a cutting table, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Here's is a diamond saw. When you cut marble you have to use water, so it automatically shoots water out.

**Devotee:**
You can make the cut if you want to.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the marble? No.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
This is a marble base. This is what they cut on, just to make it flat. It has to be a perfectly flat table. This is part of the floor for your study room.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. This is marble?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes, this is all marble, but it is glued together in little pieces, like inlaid. And this is the polishing room. [break] Take the rough marble and make it shine.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have spent so much money. What is the price of this machine?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Well, there was a man, he was going out of business in Pittsburg, and I got a great deal of marble and all the machinery and everything for nine thousand dollars. It is very cheap.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Do you know how to work? No. [devotees laugh]

**Kīrtanānanda:**
That is a heater. It's burning wood. [break]

[walking outside, //kīrtana// going on]

**Kīrtanānanda:**
...growing //mung// beans in this little field over there.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// [break]

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...horse? What do they do? Plowing?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes. They do some plowing, they do some pulling wagons. Mostly they are used in the woods for logging.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. This land is very nice. For //mung// beans?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes, those are all //mung// beans up there. [break]

**Children:**
//Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Kṛṣṇa Balarāma used to practice race with the birds.

**Hari-śauri:**
Now our boys are racing with the cows.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is childish game. This nature is there in Kṛṣṇa. This is their only school building?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
This is not ours. This was an old school building, public school, but that is not our building.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is not our?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Not ours. [break] ...looks like it might clear today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. How these logs will be used?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Roof.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. And you have to cut into planks? No. Or beams?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cylinder? Gas?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Gas. [end]
