**Pradyumna:** Translation: "My dear friends, O sons of the demons, it is certain that no one bereft of knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been able to liberate himself from material bondage at any time or in any country. Rather, those bereft of knowledge of the Lord are bound by the material laws. They are factually addicted to sense gratification, and their target is woman. Indeed, they are actually playthings in the hands of attractive women. Victimized by such a conception of life, they become surrounded by children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and thus they are shackled to material bondage. Those who are very much addicted to this conception of life are called demons. Therefore, although you are sons of demons, keep aloof from such persons and take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, the origin of all the demigods, because the ultimate goal for the devotees of Nārāyaṇa is liberation from the bondage of material existence."

**Prabhupāda:**
Purport also.

**Pradyumna:**
"Prahlāda Mahārāja has maintained the philosophical point of view that one should give up the dark well of family life and go to the forest to take shelter of the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead [//hitvātma-pātaṁ gṛham andha-kūpaṁ vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]]. In this verse also, he stresses the same point. In the history of human society, no one, at any time or any place, has been liberated because of too much affection and attachment for his family. Even in those who are apparently very educated, the same family attachment is there. They cannot give up the association of their families, even in old age or invalidity, for they are attached to sense enjoyment. As we have several times discussed, //yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]: so-called householders are simply attracted by sexual enjoyment. Thus they keep themselves shackled in family life, and furthermore, they want their children to be shackled in the same way. Playing the parts of playboys in the hands of women, they glide down to the darkest regions of material existence. //Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]. Because they are unable to control their senses, they continue a life of chewing the chewed and therefore descend to the darkest material regions. One should give up the association of such demons and adhere to the association of devotees. Thus one will be able to be liberated from material bondage."

**Prabhupāda:**

> yato na kaścit kva ca kutracid vā
> dīnaḥ svam ātmānam alam samarthaḥ
> vimocituṁ kāma-dṛśāṁ vihāra-
> krīḍā-mṛgo yan-nigaḍo visargaḥ

> tato vidūrāt parihṛtya daityā
> daityeṣu saṅgaṁ viṣayātmakeṣu
> upeta nārāyaṇam ādi-devaṁ
> sa mukta-saṅgair iṣito 'pavargaḥ
> [[books:sb:7:6:17-18|[SB 7.6.17-18]]]

So //visargaḥ// and //apavargaḥ. Visargaḥ// means creation. So the important fact is that if we are attached to the material world, maybe very minute quantity, then there will be //visargaḥ. Visargaḥ// means creation. We'll have to accept another body. Unless you are completely pure... //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam. Śūnyam// means zero.

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

So the back to home, back to Godhead, we are trying. That is our ambition. But if we have got a little propensity for material enjoyment, then... We may get very better position in the material world, in the Svargaloka, heavenly planet. The description of heavenly planet is given also in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam//---very, very opulent, we cannot imagine even how they are opulent. The roads are made of pearls, diamonds, coral. The roads are made of like that. And at the same time, no sinful man is admitted there. Everyone highly elevated, pious. There is no crookedness, there is no enviousness. So many... You'll find this description in the Eighth Canto, of Svargaloka. There are... Everything we cannot imagine even.

But that is also within this material world, within this material world. //Yānti deva-vratā devān// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]. We can go there if we want to go. Just like they are trying, the modern so-called scientist, to go to the moon planet, Mars. According to //śāstra,// these planets are bedecked with such descriptive facilities. They are also within the heavenly planets. But these rascals are going, and they find nobody there, and they take some dust and come back. This is their success. They do not know that they cannot enter even there. They are not meant for ordinary persons---at least those who are sinless, very straightforward, not envious. So anyway, even if we go, //ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna...// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]], it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// This is Svargaloka. And above that... //Bhūr, bhuvaḥ, svaḥ.// You have got the //Gāyatrī, oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya.// There are other higher planets also: Svargaloka, Janaloka, Tapoloka, Maharloka, Satyaloka, Brahmaloka. There are fourteen status of different planetary systems. //Catur-daśa-bhuvana.// And the topmost is the Brahmaloka. So even if you go there, there is no relief. //Ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]. You have to come back again.

Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja is very serious that //visargaḥ,// stop this //visargaḥ.// Go back, directly to Kṛṣṇa. Don't go even in this, any planetary system within this material world. We have got description of this planetary system, but there is also fight between the demons and the //daityas.// There is also not peace. There is struggle for existence. Sometimes one party is gaining above another party, and sometimes one's kingdom is attacked by another party, the demons attacking demigods' cities, they are attacking. The struggle for existence you'll find everywhere. //Ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ.// Therefore a devotee is not interested anywhere within this material world, however very opulent it may be. There may be roads, and instead of the stone---diamonds, coral. That does not attract. They are not interested. They are interested to go to Vṛndāvana and become a grass there. This is devotee. Just like Uddhava, as soon as he entered Vṛndāvana, he immediately fell down on the road, thinking that "On this street Kṛṣṇa has walked, His friends have walked, there are footprints." So this is the ambition of a devotee. They are not interested for diamond roads or pearl roads. No.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja says that "If you, my dear //daitya// friends..." He was talking with his friends. They were born of //daitya// families. //Daitya, daitya// family means //daityeṣu saṅgaṁ viṣayātmakeṣu. Daitya// means those who are materially attached, simply for sense gratification. They..., that is the distinction between the //daityas// and //devas.// The //devas,// they are also in sense gratification, but they are devotees at the same time. Not pure devotees. Their devotion is for material opulence. They want something, return. Kṛṣṇa is also prepared. Kṛṣṇa takes sides of them. So if you want to enjoy material world, that also you can get by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, Kṛṣṇa is so pleased, so kind. Therefore //śāstra// recommends:

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta param puruṣaṁ 
> [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]

Even if you have got desire to enjoy within this material world, still you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa will satisfy you. He'll give you. There is no need of doing something else for your material enjoyment. If you want... Because we cannot give up material enjoyment. We have been habituated since time immemorial, many life after many life, simply for sense gratification. It is not very easy to give up the idea. Therefore //śāstra// says even if you have got idea of sense gratification, still you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Don't try it otherwise. Just like the //devatās.// They have got facilities for all sense gratification. Sense gratification means //udara-upastha-jihvā// [//NoI// 1], //jihvā,// this tongue, and the belly and the genitals. This is the prime sense gratificatory sources. Very palatable dishes, fill up the belly as much as possible, and then enjoy sex. This is material. In the spiritual world these things are absent. In material world these things are very prominent.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja warns his friends that if we become attached to this sense gratification, then //vimocituṁ kāma-dṛśāṁ vihāra-krīḍā-mṛgo yan-nigaḍo visargaḥ. Nigaḍa, nigaḍa// means the root, the root cause of accepting the material body. These things are sense gratification. //Tato vidūrāt:// from distant place. //Tato vidūrāt parihṛtya daityā.// "My dear friends, although you are born of //daitya// family, I am also born"---his father is also //daitya. Daityeṣu saṅgaṁ viṣayātmakeṣu:// "Give up their..." //Asat-saṅga-tyāga ei vaiṣṇava ācāra// [[books:cc:madhya:22:87|[Cc. Madhya 22.87]]]. The same thing. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also said. So who is a Vaiṣṇava? Vaiṣṇava, He immediately explained, that Vaiṣṇava, what is the duty of Vaiṣṇava? Some devotee asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Sir, what is the duty of a Vaiṣṇava?" So He immediately replied in two lines, //asat-saṅga-tyāga ei vaiṣṇava ācāra:// "To give up the company of materialistic persons." Then the next question may be, "Who is materialistic?" //Asat eka 'strī-saṅgī:// "One who is attached to woman, he is //asat.//" And //kṛṣṇa-bhakta āra,// "And one who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa."

So we have to give up. So there is therefore regulative principle. At least, no illicit sex. Get yourself married, live like a gentleman, take responsibility, then gradually you'll be able to give up this sex desire. Unless we give up this sex desire, completely unagitated, there is no possibility of stopping this repetition of material birth---birth, death, old age and disease. That is not possible. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja advises, //daityeṣu saṅgaṁ viṣayātmakeṣu:// "Don't associate with..." //Asat-saṅga,// the same thing, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu... //Asat-saṅga-tyāga ei vaiṣṇava ācāra.// This is Vaiṣṇava's business. Don't take any opportunity of //asat,// those who are materially attached. It is very difficult association. Then it is possible, //upeta nārāyaṇam ādi-devaṁ sa mukta-saṅgair iṣito 'pavargaḥ.// Therefore association is very..., //sajjati siddhāśaye.// Those who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service, make your association with them.

We are therefore making different centers to give everyone the opportunity to have the association of devotee. As far as possible, we are giving shelter, we are giving //prasādam,// we are giving instruction, we are giving opportunity to worship Kṛṣṇa. Why? Because people may take the advantage of the association, Nārāyaṇa. //Nārāyaṇam ādi-devam,// they can associate with Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa and anything executed in the devotional service of Nārāyaṇa---Nārāyaṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu, the same category... //Nārāyaṇa paro 'vyaktyāt. Nārāyaṇa// means who is..., whose situation is transcendental, Nārāyaṇa. So as soon as you come in contact with Nārāyaṇa, Lakṣmī is there, goddess of fortune is there. We are not worshiping the //daridra-nārāyaṇa// manufacture, no, as they have manufactured the word. No. We have nothing to do with the so-called... It is rubbish. Nārāyaṇa cannot be //daridra. Daridra// means "poor." This is all rubbish things. They manufacture such words, atheist class of men, but we hate to see them even. Nārāyaṇa is always opulent. //Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrno bhagavān// [[books:cc:adi:1:3|[Cc. Ādi 1.3]]], always. How Nārāyaṇa can be //daridra,// poor? That is not possible.

So //nārāyaṇam ādi-devaṁ sa mukta-saṅgair iṣito 'pavargaḥ. Apavarga// means release from these material sufferings. We have several times explained. //Pavarga, pavarga// means material suffering. //Pa// means //pariśrama, pariśrama,// always working hard, day and night. And //pha, phena,// foam coming out of my mouth. //Pa, pha, ba,// still baffled. //Bha// is fearfulness. //Pa, pha, ba, bha// and //ma, mṛtyu,// at last death. This is called //pavargaḥ.// And //apavargaḥ// means just to counteract this //pavargaḥ.// So in one life if we try to associate with the devotees and engage in Nārāyaṇa's service sincerely... May be a little difficult. There is no difficulty. Where is the difficulty? We can see practically. To chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// and take //prasādam,// is there any difficulty? There is no difficulty. It is so pleasing. Therefore //Bhagavad-gītā// explains, //susukhaṁ kartum avyayam// [[books:bg:9:2|[Bg. 9.2]]]. //Susukham,// very easy and pleasing to execute. And //susukhaṁ kartum// and //avyayam.// And whatever you do, that is permanent. That is permanent.

So don't wait for another life, "I have done so much permanent, now again." No. Finish this business immediately in this life. Do not wait for //susukhaṁ kartum avyayam.// Kṛṣṇa consciousness means fully become detached with this material enjoyment. Simply become engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, your life will be successful.

Thank you very much.
