**Pradyumna:** Translation: "My dear sons of demons, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nārāyaṇa, is the original Supersoul, the father of all living entities. Consequently there are no impediments to pleasing Him or worshiping Him under any conditions, whether one be a child or an old man. The relationship between the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead is always a fact, and therefore there is no difficulty in pleasing the Lord." [[books:sb:7:6:19|[SB 7.6.19]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Read the purport also.

**Pradyumna:**
Purport: "One may ask, one is certainly very attached to family life, but if one gives up family life to be attached to the service of the Lord, one must undergo the same endeavor and trouble. Therefore, what is the benefit of taking the trouble to engage in the service of the Lord?" This is not a valid objection. The Lord asserts in //Bhagavad-gītā// [14.4]:

> sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya
> mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ
> tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir
> ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā

“ 'It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father.' The Supreme Lord, Nārāyaṇa, is the seed-giving father of all living entities because the living entities are parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord [//mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [15.7]. As there is no difficulty in establishing the intimate relationship between a father and son, there is no difficulty in reestablishing the natural, intimate relationship between Nārāyaṇa and the living entities. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]]: if one performs even very slight devotional service, Nārāyaṇa is always ready to save one from the greatest danger. The definite example is Ajāmila. Ajāmila separated himself from the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing many sinful activities and was condemned by Yamarāja to be very severely punished. But because at the time of death he chanted the name of Nārāyaṇa, although he was calling not for the Supreme Lord Nārāyaṇa but for his son named Nārāyaṇa, he was saved from the hands of Yamarāja. Therefore, pleasing Nārāyaṇa does not require as much endeavor as pleasing one's family, community and nation. We have seen important political leaders killed for a slight discrepancy in their behavior. Therefore pleasing one's society, family, community and nation is extremely difficult. Pleasing Nārāyaṇa, however, is not at all difficult; it is very easy.

"One's duty is to revive one's relationship with Nārāyaṇa. A slight endeavor in this direction will make the attempt successful, whereas one will never be successful in pleasing his so-called family, society and nation, even if one endeavors to sacrifice his life. The simple endeavor involved in the devotional service of //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]], hearing and chanting the holy name of the Lord, can make one successful in pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore bestowed His blessings by saying, //paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam:// "All glories to Śrī Kṛṣṇa //saṅkīrtana!//" If one wants to derive the actual benefit from this human form, he must take to the chanting of the holy name of the Lord."

**Prabhupāda:**

> na hy acyutaṁ prīṇayato
> bahv-āyāso 'surātmajāḥ
> ātmatvāt sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> siddhatvād iha sarvataḥ
> [[books:sb:7:6:19|[SB 7.6.19]]]

To become a devotee of the Supreme Lord is not unnatural. It is very easy, natural thing. By nature we are attached to Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Somehow or other, circumstantially, we are separated... Not separated, because here it is stated //ātmatvāt:// the Supreme Personality of Godhead is, although we are thinking we are different from Him, He is within our hearts. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. He is so friendly that although we are averse---we do not like even the word of God---God is so kind that He is sitting within my heart, //īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām.// He's simply looking forward for the opportunity when I, the living entity, shall look towards Him. He's always anxious.

So little endeavor is sufficient to begin our business with Him. Little endeavor. And that endeavor begins by hearing about Him. We are holding classes in different parts of the world just to give people chance for little endeavor---not very much, very hard work, no. Little endeavor. What is that? "Please come here and hear about Kṛṣṇa." Then the business begins immediately. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtana// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. Because Kṛṣṇa is very much anxious: "When this conditioned soul will look towards Me? He's now looking towards //māyā,// the other side, the dark side, and when he'll look towards the light?" The Vedic injunction is, //tamasi mā jyotir gama:// "Do not look forward to the darkness, but look forward to the light." If you look forward to the light, then there is no darkness. We have given our motto in the //Back to Godhead// that "Kṛṣṇa is the sun and //māyā// is nescience. Where there is Kṛṣṇa there is no //māyā.//" If you look forward towards the sun, there is no darkness. But if you keep sun back side, you'll find your shadow very long. So the beginning is very easy. Just like the children, they are also hearing about Kṛṣṇa. Don't think it is going in vain. Because they are hearing, it will have some effect. They are human child. Even the mosquitoes or small germs who are within this boundary of temple, because they are hearing Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// it will never go in vain. It is so nice.

So here it is said..., Prahlāda Mahārāja says, //ātmatvāt sarva-bhūtānām.// He is the Supersoul, //sarva-bhūtānām,// everyone. So as soon as He sees, Kṛṣṇa sees---He is within my heart---that I am little inclined, //svalpam apy asya dharmasya...// That inclination, little inclination, we can give immediately effect to if we simply hear about Kṛṣṇa. //Śravaṇam.// That is the beginning.

> śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
> smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam
> arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ
> sakhyam ātma-nivedanam
> [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]

So //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanam// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. Even if we do not understand what is being spoken about Kṛṣṇa, still, simply by hearing, one becomes pious. //Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtana. Kīrtana,// one is speaking or chanting, another is hearing. Both of them are benefited, becomes pious. In this way, we cannot understand Kṛṣṇa unless we are sinless. So there is no need of separate attempt to become sinless. If we simply hear, then we... //Puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtana. Puṇya// means piety. Simply by hearing, you become pious. Then you become interested, naturally. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ// [Brs. 1.4.15]. Somehow or other, if one becomes a little fit for: "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. What they are doing, let me see," that is called //śraddhā.// If the //śraddhā// is little increased, then one will like to associate with the devotees. //Adau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-sangaḥ.// In this way, when he is accustomed, then he will like to become one of the devotees, offers himself to be initiated.

//Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ.// These are one after another. //Ādau śraddhā tato sādhu-saṅgaḥ atha bhajana-kriyā. Bhajana-kriyā,// the beginning is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// This is //bhajana-kriyā.// And if it is done properly, then //anartha-nivṛtti syāt:// then he becomes free from all unwanted things, //anartha.// There is no need... Just like intoxication---there is no need. But if the //bhajana-kriyā,// Hare Kṛṣṇa //maha-mantra// chanting, goes on, naturally it will be stopped. Then //niṣṭha. Tato niṣṭha tato ruci tataḥ asaktiḥ. Asaktiḥ,// attachment. In this way we can make advanced. The beginning is //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇa.// As soon as Kṛṣṇa sees, //ātmatvāt sarva bhūtānām,// little attempt is there, immediately He helps. //Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ yena mām upayānti te// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]: Kṛṣṇa helps, "Yes, you come here, sit down, you do this." In this way, //yena mām upayānti te.// Kṛṣṇa helps to the direction as he can achieve the lotus feet, shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. //Hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi vidhunoti// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. We have got so many dirty things within our hearts, and as soon as we are a little inclined to hear about Kṛṣṇa, He removes the dirty things, then we become more and more enthused. In this way, //nityaṁ bhāgavata sevayā. Naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. Not that cent percent we are cleansed, but even a little percentage cleansed, //naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā. Nityam,// daily, there must be //bhāgavata-sevā.// Everything is //sevayā. Prasāda-seva, bhāgavata-sevā.// Because //sevā// means service. Just like //maha-prasāda,// not eating. The exact term is //sevā.// Kṛṣṇa has sent the //maha-prasāda.// So by taking it, it is //sevā,// it is service to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa likes it that you take the //prasādam;// therefore it is //sevā.// In this way, increasing //sevā.//

So if we can... //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau// [Brs. 1.2.234]. The //sevā,// the service, begins from the tongue, service. Not with the hand but with the tongue. If you simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, this is //sevā,// and if you take //prasādam,// then your business begins immediately. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.// And if you simply continue this //sevā,// then Kṛṣṇa will reveal Himself, and gradually He will give you intelligence how you can make advance to go back to home, back to Godhead. 

//Na hy acyutaṁ prīṇayato. Acyutam,// Kṛṣṇa is //acyuta. Acyuta// means who never falls down, or never withdraws his promise. That is //acyuta.// Just like we promise something, but sometimes we do not keep. This is material world. But Kṛṣṇa is not like that. Kṛṣṇa says... His name is Acyuta, means never fall down. Just like Arjuna asked Kṛṣṇa, //rathaṁ sthāpaya me 'cyuta// [[books:bg:1:21-22|[Bg. 1.21]]]. He's ordering Kṛṣṇa to drive the chariot. He knew that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is my duty to serve Him, but He has agreed to become my chariot driver, so now I have to order Him. He has agreed to become my chariot..." Therefore he is reminding, "Kṛṣṇa, do not take it otherwise because I am ordering You. You are not to be ordered, but You order everyone. Now I am ordering You, but You are //acyuta,// You are never fallible. You never withdraw Your word." So Kṛṣṇa also carried his order. He's so nice friend of Arjuna that He promised, "I shall become your chariot driver." And the master is ordering. Therefore he used this word, //acyuta.//

So Acyuta, Kṛṣṇa, never falls from His word, from His promise. And He promises, //kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. If you become His devotee, rest assured you will never be vanquished. Kṛṣṇa is always protective. So such... We are loitering in this material world without any protection. //Kadāham aikāntika kiñkaraḥ praharṣayiṣyāmi sānatha-jīvitam// [//Stotra-ratna// 43]. There is a verse by Yamunacārya, //kadāham aikāntika nitya kiñkaraḥ.// Just now I forget the first line. He's praying, "My dear Lord, I am loitering in this material world without any guardian. So when the time will come that I shall be jolly always, that 'There is my guardian, Kṛṣṇa'?" //Kadāham aikāntika nitya kiñkaraḥ praharṣayiṣyāmi. Anātha.// Everyone is in this material world, //anātha. Anātha// means without any protection. The... We are thinking, "My family, my wife, my children, my society men, my nation will give me protection." No. Nobody can give you protection. It is false hope. Just like the birds, when they fly in the sky, everyone has to take his own care. Nobody can help anybody. One can help only in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not in the material ways. Nobody can help. Because... This is called destiny. I have given that example that in our country, Mahatma Gandhi, he was a big man, he was in the meeting. But in your country also, President Kennedy. So nobody could help him when he was killed.

So this is the position. What is destined, it must happen. Nobody can help us. That's a fact. Therefore our real business is: do not be bothered about things which are destined. Let us take advantage of this human form of life, //tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]], to endeavor for making Kṛṣṇa consciousness fulfilled. And that is not very difficult. Prahlāda Mahārāja: this is natural, simply little attempt. First of all surrender. //Kāmādīnāṁ katidhā kati na pālitā durṇideśa// [[books:cc:madhya:22:36|[Cc. Madhya 22.16, Brs. 3.2.25]]]. We are servants of our //kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, kāmādīnā. Kāma// means lusty desires. We are now servant of our senses. Although we are declaring, "I am master," nobody is master; he is servant. Constitutionally, we are servants. So instead of becoming servant of Kṛṣṇa we have become servant of our senses. //Kāmādīnāṁ katidhā kati na pālitā durṇideśa.// And our senses ordering to do something which is not to be done at all. But still we have to do. Lusty desires are so strong, I do not want to do it, but it is forcing. In this way, we are being forced to serve the senses.

So one who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he understands that "I have become servant of my senses. Unfortunately, these senses are not satisfied. I am still servant. So there is no profit. So why not become Kṛṣṇa's servant?" This is good intelligence. Simply change the position. Instead of becoming servant of the senses, agree to become servant of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Therefore it is not at all difficult. //Nācyutaṁ prīṇayato.// You have to simply approach Kṛṣṇa, "My Lord, I am servant, but I could not please anyone. Neither anyone is pleased upon me." This is material service. You serve the whole life your so-called friends, family, countrymen... We have got the experience that Mahatma Gandhi, he served whole life. Still, he was killed by his countrymen. So you may go on giving service in the material world, but nobody will be satisfied. Nobody will be satisfied. So this service is useless. Turn to the service of Kṛṣṇa immediately. It is not very difficult. Servant... We are practiced to serve. We are not master. We have been practiced. By nature, we are servant. So turn this service to Kṛṣṇa. It is not difficult. If I am trained up to become a faithful servant, just become a faithful servant of Kṛṣṇa, then your business is complete. //Na hi acyutaṁ prīṇayato bahu-āyāsaḥ.// Much endeavor. There is no question of learning, much endeavor. We are already accustomed to give service. Simply turn it towards Kṛṣṇa and your life is successful.

Thank you very much.
