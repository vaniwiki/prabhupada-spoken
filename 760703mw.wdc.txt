**Prabhupāda:**
What is that building?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
This is the neighborhood. It is a very rich neighborhood, Prabhupāda. Very wealthy. This is the most wealthy neighborhood, practically all of America. The builders are putting up houses all in here, just like that house over there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, bungalow pattern.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. This is very nice.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Yes, Prabhupāda. 

**Prabhupāda:**
Is it not?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Very peaceful.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Many senators and congressmen, they live out here.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They ever come to the Sunday feast?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Some do. One man does. [break] We've been here a short time, only four months. So we have to advertise more so people will come on the Sunday feast. But I think we will have thousands.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. [break] ...trees very long?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Just pine trees and oak trees. No fruit trees. [break] Yes. He was run over by a car. He was intoxicated.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then? What happened? He was not identified?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
They said that he lived in these woods back here, way back in the woods.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, drunkard.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Yes. They had many cars here, all day for two days. All the police, ambulance, TV.

**Prabhupāda:**
To take photograph?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
To take photograph of the place. It became a monument. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just to see a dead body.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
[laughs] Crows. [end]
