**Prabhupāda:**
//...punaḥ punaś carvita carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]], again spend millions of dollars. And our rascal Indian leaders, they are also. What is that here, she has remarked, "Hare Kṛṣṇa cult."

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yeah, that Indian cultural organization.

**Rūpānuga:**
Who said that?

**Prabhupāda:**
One...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They have one cultural organization, they want to export //yogīs// and teachers who they approve of, the Indian government approves of as being bona fide. Because the American government, so many people are complaining about misrepresentation by these Indian //svāmīs// and so-called //yogīs// that are coming over. So they put Guru..., the Divine Light Society...

**Hari-śauri:**
They said that once this is established there will be no room for the Divine Lighters, the Hare Kṛṣṇa cultists, like this.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
T.M., like that.

Hari-śauri: Transcendental Meditation.

Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: Label, put us all together.

**Rūpānuga:**
Really.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Foolish woman.

**Prabhupāda:**
And they're spending...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
A hundred and sixty nine //lakhs// or something.

**Prabhupāda:**
A hundred and sixty nine //lakhs// per year, inviting foreign cultures to lecture.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
And only a handful came.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Only a handful they had; something like sixty people. They spent two...

**Prabhupāda:**
And what culture they'll speak? [Hindi]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Culural exchange.

**Prabhupāda:**
They can speak, "Milk is dangerous and meat is very nutritious. Kill all the cows." Oh, yes, it's very scientific. This is the cult. "Milk is dangerous." Is it not?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, they're saying that, the doctors nowadays.

**Rūpānuga:**
It's true.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
I remember one day you retorted that. You said that "Milk is nothing but the blood of the cow transformed. And the milk is bad but the blood is good?"

**Rūpānuga:**
They scare people by saying that milk helps to create heart disease and artery disease, like that. They frighten people with that propaganda, the doctors.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Meat creates cancer of the intestines.

**Rūpānuga:**
Actually, there have been some articles in papers lately about meat and cancer, linking meat and cancer. Prominent, prominently displayed articles.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why do you give milk to the children? Give him blood.

**Rūpānuga:**
They say past a certain age...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, this propaganda---milk is bad---so why from the very beginning you give milk to the children?

**Rūpānuga:**
Actually, in America they do not feed the children by the breast. They use cow's milk practically from birth.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I say.

**Rūpānuga:**
It's true.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
There was an article in the newspaper about that today. It said in the newspaper that if women stop breast feeding their children they will have to increase the population of dairy cows tremendously. A very small percentage do now.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have to increase?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
More and more cows to produce enough milk to feed children.

**Prabhupāda:**
And therefore we are killing children. There is no problem, we shall kill our... Why do you call? We shall kill, wholesale. And go to ball dance.

**Hari-śauri:**
The whole civilization is completely crazy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kārtikeya told me. After many years he went to see his mother, and mother was going to ball dance. And mother said, "Wait, I am coming back." And he was surprised. He told me. Son has come at home after many years, and she could not talk with him. She was going to ball dance.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
It's actually that way. It actually goes on that way.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the mother.

**Hari-śauri:**
Completely callous.

**Rūpānuga:**
Not even mother love anymore.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mother killing. He was about to be killed. He admits. His grandmother advised the mother. Yes. Kṛṣṇa saved him. Because he is devotee, some way or other, he was saved. Your grandmother still living?

**Hari-śauri:**
Just.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why don't you say, [laughs] "You wanted to kill me, just see, I'm chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa."

**Hari-śauri:**
I don't think it would go down very well if I mentioned it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Hari-śauri:**
I don't think it would be received very well.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
She might say, "See, I was right."

**Prabhupāda:**
Mother advising young daughter to kill her child.

**Rūpānuga:**
Actually there was a statement in the national magazine, the President's wife was advising her own daughter to the reporters that she should have illicit sex.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, this President's wife, this present First Lady, is very abominable. She actually came out and said, "If I were young I would also experiment with drugs." So many things.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, why here? In India, in India, in a office, I was going there for my //Back to Godhead,// so the clerk had one girl, they were intimately related, and the girl's father, mother allowed. The boy was coming. And when the girl wanted to marry him, the father refused: "No, no, you cannot marry. Let him come as friend, but there is no question of marriage."

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
What was their purpose?

**Prabhupāda:**
Purpose is that "You are young girl, you can have a young boy as friend and have your sex, but don't talk of marriage." This is the plain fact. "You need sex? All right, keep him as friend. Marriage, that I will select, or a better boy. When we find, then there is question of marriage. He's a clerk, how you can be married with him? He's coming as friend. You enjoy sex, that's all." This is the... First of all, he was ordered not to come. Then the girl began to cry. Then he allowed, "All right let him come, but there is no question of marriage." Why he? Our, that [name withheld]. You know? He was Ambassador in Germany. His daughter is a devotee. That boy who was selling books? [name withheld].

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
[name withheld] is the girl's name.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Her father said "Yes, you keep as friend, don't marry." The [name withheld], Mr....

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
He said that concerning [name withheld] and her?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [name withheld] is living with her at her father's house. So he did not object but he objected marriage.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
I heard that she became like a witch. [name withheld] left her. He couldn't bear associating with her. Now he's //brahmacārī// again. [laughter] That was one of Bhagavān's marriages that didn't work out.

**Rūpānuga:**
We were thinking that just like when you were in Moscow, a picture was taken..., some pictures were taken that were used for //Back to Godhead,// very good propaganda. We were thinking maybe when we go on this tour that in front of the White House maybe we could take a picture and use it in //Back to Godhead// in an article like that. That might be good propaganda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you can do.

**Rūpānuga:**
So we were thinking we would go there to the White House on the first part, then to Capitol, second part, then around to Lincoln Memorial, then Monument for fireworks ceremony.

**Prabhupāda:**
I will go to the fireworks. [end]
