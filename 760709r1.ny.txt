**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
To the right, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Hari-śauri:**
[to devotee:] I have to get set up for massage. You can do the machine? It's recording now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice sitting place.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Above all the noise in New York City, too.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
It's not so noisy up here.

**Pālikā:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Pālikā wants to ask you something.

**Pālikā:**
Would you like to take fruit now, or //prasādam// as regular?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, I have taken breakfast. So Bali-mardana Prabhu, doing all right?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Those are your servants' quarters, and the kitchen, and there's also a dresser in your bedroom.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is... There is any closet to be locked?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
Just here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This closet here is a walk-in closet. It's a small room with a lock. You also have a cabinet that locks.

**Ādi-keśava:**
Your cabinet from Henry St.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's a big walk-in closet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's nice. So I shall again stay in New York? Nice place.

**Ādi-keśava:**
From this window here you can see the Empire State Building and all the big buildings in New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, very nice.

**Rāmeśvara:**
There will not be any noise here either, because this is the eleventh floor.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rāmeśvara:**
So it's very peaceful for translating work.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
My Guru Mahārāja left alone, so he has sent so many //gurus// to take care of me. You are all my Guru Mahārāja's representatives.

**Bali-mardana:**
We are //guru-dāsa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So you are taking care. I am very much obliged to you. I sometimes think in my childhood I was very, very pet son of my father. I have admitted that in that //Kṛṣṇa// book. I told my father was not very rich man, but still, whatever I wanted, he would give me. He never chastised me, but full love. Then of course I got friends and I was married. By Kṛṣṇa's grace everyone loved me. [laughs] And I came to this foreign country without any acquaintance. So Kṛṣṇa has sent so many fathers to love me. In that way I am fortunate. At the last stage if I live very peacefully, that is a great mercy of Kṛṣṇa. By Kṛṣṇa's mercy everything is possible. So we shall stick to Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet and everything is possible. What is that book? After //Kṛṣṇa// book?

**Devotee:**
This one?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, after //Kṛṣṇa// book, that yellow...?

**Dhṛṣṭadyumna:**
//Teachings of Lord Caitanya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So distribute this //prasādam.// So Eighth Canto is also...?

**Rāmeśvara:**
It is going out to the printer in the month of July, this month, by the end of the month.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, first part.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Yes, but there is also a third part to the Seventh Canto. That is coming any day.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Cyavana Mahārāja, you are making your mind fixed up?

**Cyavana:**
Yes, I'm feeling like my old self again.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you are good boy. Whatever is done is done. Now you remain with Vaiṣṇavas and fix up your mind. After all, it is a struggle between //māyā// and Kṛṣṇa. Sometimes, due to our weakness, we may fall down, but we should take again strength and stand up. Yes. Do that, and combinedly push this movement in America. It is a good field. And if we can establish this movement in America, whole world will take. That is my ambition. What is the length and breadth of this house area?

**Ādi-keśava:**
I don't know exactly.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the..., no? The hall is very big.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
See, it goes around, Prabhupāda.

**Ādi-keśava:**
That is also a room.

**Rāmeśvara:**
You can walk around.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can show you.

**Rāmeśvara:**
On each floor it is like that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Every floor has about twenty-five to thirty rooms.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ohh. Not only this portion.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, all the way round.

**Ādi-keśava:**
That over there you see out the window is also...

**Bali-mardana:**
The long part is in the front. It goes all the way down.

**Prabhupāda:**
I shall take my massage.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda!

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. [end]
