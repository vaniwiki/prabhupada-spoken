Translation: "Those who are anxious to awaken their spiritual consciousness, who have unflinching intelligence and who are not deviated, certainly attain the desired goal."

**Prabhupāda:**

> acirād eva sarvārthaḥ
> sidhyaty eṣām abhīpsitaḥ
> sad-dharmasyāvabodhāya
> yeṣāṁ nirbandhinī matiḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:20:106|[Cc. Madhya 20.106]]]

So here the most important word is //sad-dharma. Dharma...// In the English dictionary //dharma// is described as a kind of faith, but here it is said, //sad-dharma. Sad-dharma. Sat// means which exists, which never diminishes. In the Vedic knowledge we get information, //asato mā sad gama:// "Don't remain in the nonexistentional platform." //Sad-gama:// "Go to the platform of eternal life." That we can understand, what is //sat// and what is //asat. Sat, cit, ānanda. Sac-cid-ānanda.// We describe Kṛṣṇa, //īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. So that is //sat. Sat// means eternal. And so according to reference with //sat// and //asat,// there are two kinds of //dharma.// I... Several places in my books I have described, //dharma// means occupational duty, occupational duty. So if we are on the platform of //asad-dharma,// just like on the conception of this body... This is //asad-dharma.// Everyone knows the body will not exist; therefore it is //asat.// So any //dharma// or any occupational duty with reference to this nonpermanent body, that is //asad-dharma. Asad-dharma.// Whatever our occupational duties are now going on in this big city of New York... What is their occupational duty? The duty... Everyone is going to the office early in the morning. They have got... Everyone has got duty, but that duty---//asad-dharma.// Body will not exist; therefore anything done on account of the body, that is //asad-dharma.// That is not real //dharma.// Real //dharma// is when you come to the platform of //sat.// That //sat// we have to understand, what is //sat// and what is //asat. Asat:// nonpermanent. Everyone will know that this body is not permanent. And //sat?// That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// You have to learn it. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. The body is //asat,// it will be destroyed, but the soul, which will never be destroyed... //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre. Nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ na hanyate... Na jāyate mriyate vā kadācit.// That soul is never born, never dies, //kadācit,// at any time. Not that sometimes it dies and sometimes... No. Any time, //kadācit.//

So this //sad-dharma// means the occupational duty of the soul. That is //sad-dharma.// And except that duty, whatever we are doing, that is //asad-dharma;// it will not stay. Now I have got this body, Indian body or Christian body or American body. But this, everything, this conception of Christianity or Indian nationality or American nationality---everything will be finished with this body. Everything will be finished. Therefore all our engagements in this connection, they are all //asad-dharma.// It is very difficult. We are all engaged in occupational duties, all //asad-dharma.// But the Vedic injunction is //asato mā sad gama:// "Don't remain in this //asat// platform. Come to the //sat// platform." And the same thing is described here, //sad-dharmasyāvabodhāya.//

So the human life begins when we can distinguish between //sat// and //asat.// If we remain in darkness, without understanding what is //sat// and //asat,// then we are no better than dogs and cats. So the modern civilization, not only... Nowadays very big problem. People are very much attached to //asad-dharma.// They are not... Because they are so dull-headed, they cannot understand what is //sat// and what is //asat.// They cannot understand, dull-headed. Therefore brain requires to be clarified. The two words are used in the //śāstra: alpa-medhasaḥ// and //sumedhasaḥ. Medha// means brain substance. So those who have got brain substance, they are called //sumedhasaḥ,// and those who have no brain substance, filled up with cow dung, they are called //alpa-medhasaḥ.// So this distinction I made in Chicago. It made a very great agitation because I discriminated that men are found to have more brain substance than the woman. So there was a great agitation. But this is fact psychologically, that brain substance in man is greater than the brain substance in woman. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also, //striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrāḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. But in spiritual understanding there is no such distinction, because //sad-dharma,// spiritual understanding, has nothing to do with this body. The brain substance, more or less, is in connection with this body, but the //sat,// the spirit soul, it has nothing to do with the body. So long it has to do something with the body, that is called //māyā.// He's //sat,// but he is absorbed in the thought of //asat.// That is called //māyā:// what he is not. He is absorbed in thoughts of the bodily comforts of life. That is //asad-dharma.// The //karmīs, jñānīs, yogīs,// they are all //asad-dharmī// because there is reference with the body. //Karmī,// in gross ignorance he knows that "Everything is this body, so let me enjoy bodily comforts, sense enjoyment, as far as possible." Not only in this life, next life... Even if he believes in the next life, but still, he's after these bodily comforts. "I shall be promoted in the higher planetary system. I shall go to the moon planet, I shall go to the Mars planet," and so on, so on. These are //karmīs'// plan. Anything within this material world, that is all //asat.//

So the //karmīs// are too much attached with the //asad-dharma,// total, cent percent. And the //jñānīs,// they are little intelligent, that... //Jñānī// means "I have tried so much to be happy with the bodily comforts, but it has not become possible." Then he tries to understand, "Whether I am this body or something else?" That is Vedic injunction, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// When he is actually liberated he understands that "I am not this body." So he tries to get rid of this bodily conception of life, but because he has no information of the ultimate goal of life, he thinks that "If I merge with the Supreme, then my life is successful." But that is also //asad-dharma,// because this impersonal understanding will not help him, because he is person. Every one of us, we are person. We cannot stay on the impersonal platform. That is not possible. Artificially if we try to stay on the impersonal platform, it will not stay. Then we shall fall down again. Just like this moon excursion or the Mars. They do not get actually shelter there; therefore they fall down again, come here. With some stone and sand, they are satisfied. Because they did not get any shelter, they fall down.

So //śāstra// therefore forbids or gives warning, //āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. The same example. With great endeavor, with much expenditure you may go eighty thousand miles per hour, but unless you get shelter, you have again come back to this, either in America or Russia. They tried, but they could not get shelter. Similarly, the one may understand that he is spirit soul, and he may try his best to merge into the spiritual effulgence, Brahman---//ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// "I shall remain in Brahman"---but because he is person, the impersonalism condition will not be helpful to him, and because he has no personal view of the Supreme Spirit---he cannot surrender to Kṛṣṇa---naturally he again comes back to this material world and surrenders to the material subject matter. Sometimes he is engaged in philanthropic work or altruistic work. He thought, "This is the best service. Instead of serving myself, let me serve the whole humanity, whole community, whole nation," so on, so on, so on. But they are all //asad-dharma.// They are not //sad-dharma.//

So when one is actually in //sad-dharma// or he is hankering after //sad-dharma,// then Kṛṣṇa helps him. Kṛṣṇa helps him. That we get information from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Because Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart, so Kṛṣṇa gives him opportunity. //Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]].

> teṣām evānukampārtham
> aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ
> nāśayāmy ātma-bhāva-stho
> jñāna-dipena bhāsvatā
> [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]]

Kṛṣṇa gives him real knowledge. Therefore //guru-kṛṣṇa kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. So he becomes more and more inquisitive to understand what is //sad-dharma.// So //sad-dharmasyāvabodhāya.// If one is actually serious, //nirbandhinī matiḥ... Nirbandhinī matiḥ// means with firm conviction that "In this life I shall be fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, I shall understand fully Kṛṣṇa." In this way if we have got firm determination, then Kṛṣṇa will help. That is, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //sidhyaty eṣām abhīpsitaḥ.// If one is actually eager to understand his position and his goal of life, then Kṛṣṇa will help. We require determination. That is wanted. //Laulyam ekaṁ mūlyam. Laulyam,// to advance in spiritual consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the value is only strong eagerness, //laulyam,// that "I must finish this business in this life to understand Kṛṣṇa." There are many śāstric references. //Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ yena mām upayānti te.// Simply we should be very seriously eager. Then very soon, //acirād eva sidhyaty abhīpsitaḥ,// immediately... If not immediately... We should patiently. Simply we should be very, very eager. //Tatra laulyam ekaṁ mūlyam. Laulyam// means very greediness or... We can say, "How I shall approach Kṛṣṇa?" This greediness required, not greediness for sense gratification. Then we shall be implicated more and more.

The greediness... Greediness is very good. //Kāmaṁ kṛṣṇa-karmārpaṇe.// Strong desire, that is called lust. So, but this strong desire... Just like //gopīs.// The //gopīs,// they were village girls. They had no understanding of what is God, what is Kṛṣṇa. But they became very much lusty for Kṛṣṇa, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended that //ramyā kācid upāsanā vrajavadhūbir yā kalpitā// [//Caitanya-matta-mañjuṣā//]: "There is no better type of worship than what was conceived by the //gopīs.//" Their strong desire, "How we shall get Kṛṣṇa?" that was their day and night thought. That's all. Somebody is thinking in some way... The central point was Kṛṣṇa. I have already explained that, that Kṛṣṇa was going to the pasturing ground, and the //gopīs// at home, they were thinking that "Kṛṣṇa's foot is so soft and so delicate," and that "We dare not to take His feet on our breast, but He is now walking in the fields, pasturing ground, naked, without any..., and the stones pricking. How much He is feeling pain." Thinking this, they became fainted. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended //ramyā kācid upāsanā.// These //gopīs,// they were not supposed to be educated. Village girls---who is giving them education? They are not Ph.D.'s. But still, strong desire for Kṛṣṇa. And that is called //yeṣāṁ nirbandhinī matiḥ. Nirbandhinī,// strong desire. It doesn't require any other price to become advanced in..., simply to become very strongly eager, //laulyam.// Then life is successful.

Thank you very much.
