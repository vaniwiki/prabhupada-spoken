====== Room Conversation ======

**Indian man:**
I came to offer my obeisances to you. I became a Life Member as a result of Gopāla Kṛṣṇa's talking to me.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Bombay?

**Indian man:**
No, sir, here. I came to offer you obeisances in Brooklyn temple, and I asked you a special permission as my Gurudeva, which you gladly gave me, to teach //Gītā// in Poughkeepsie, where I am. And since then I have been trying to do your work sincerely in Poughkeepsie.

**Prabhupāda:**
Poughkeepsie.

**Indian man:**
Yes, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where it is?

**Indian man:**
It is hundred miles north of New York. I work there. I am an engineer, and I have been trying to spread Kṛṣṇa conscious movement of yours, trying to teach from your //Gītā// to the Indian community, and I have been slowly trying to get American people also involved. And, as I see, more and more American people are now coming in. And in fact, those people who are very steadfast, who come to attend my class, are the American people. I am very glad to see that they are taking very great interest. And...

**Prabhupāda:**
Indians are not taking so much.

**Indian man:**
No, sir, I'm...

**Prabhupāda:**
Indians are //bara sāhīb.// [laughs]

**Indian man:**
Ah. You see they have been going to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ready?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I wanted to just finalize when you would join the festival tomorrow. I wanted to fix that up, so I could, you know, just do that. We're leaving Fifty-ninth Street at two o'clock, and we're reaching downtown, the park, at four o'clock. In other words, it takes two hours, the route. At four o'clock we're going to have a Winnebago. Winnebago is like a small bus which has a..., it has a lavatory in it.

**Hari-śauri:**
Like Satsvarūpa Mahārāja's traveling bus.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right. It has a bathroom in it. That's going to accompany the parade in case at any time you require it, that will be right there. So it can pull alongside the cart. At four o'clock we'll arrive, and at about four-thirty Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja will give a short introduction for you, and at four forty-five you'll speak. So at four forty-five you're expected to give the lecture. It begins at two o'clock at Fifty-ninth Street for two hours. Then by five, five-fifteen, the whole thing will be over. So I wanted to know what time you would like to join the parade.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you suggest.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, it depends on a number of things. One thing is that your rest. After taking massage you take //prasādam,// and then your resting period. Another thing is how long you want to ride along on the cart. It depends on... I think it should depend on... I can't... No one can make that decision. We're agreeable to anything that you suggest. Devotees are enlivened simply that you're here in New York with us.

**Prabhupāda:**
So at two o'clock you start?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right.

**Prabhupāda:**
You want me at the starting point?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We want you to do simply what you feel would be best.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. What is the best? Starting point, my presence required?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, it's not a question of required. I mean that's a very exciting time, you know, but I don't know if it's..., I wouldn't say it's required. We're going to start. One way or the other, we have to start the parade. It's exciting at that time, probably, but you could also join midway. Suppose you could also join at Thirty-fourth Street instead of Fifty-ninth Street. Halfway is about Thirty-fourth Street. So you could join there.

**Prabhupāda:**
That will be better.

**Hari-śauri:**
That would be about three o'clock.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That would be at about three o'clock. It depends upon your resting period also.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that I will adjust. That is not the thing. I want to know when my joining will be very good. That I want to know. In the beginning or the middle, in the last, that you have to decide. Then I shall adjust. In London, I think... Of course, the whole route I was present, but that was little troublesome because sometimes I am called by nature. But you say there will be a car.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, which is equipped...

**Prabhupāda:**
So under the circumstances, which time will be good? That you say. Then I shall adjust. That you consult, which time.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, if I can have about five minutes, I'll ask a few people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Then I'll adjust.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So you're agreeable at any time as long as that convenience... That's a good convenience, I think, that we'll have that vehicle.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So I'll just inquire. This is a general idea of what's going on the whole day tomorrow. I'll leave it with Hari-śauri.

**Prabhupāda:**
The preaching is going on. Nobody has become our student?

**Indian man:**
Among the Indian people...

**Prabhupāda:**
Indian or European or American, it doesn't matter. Since you are preaching there, has anybody joined this movement?

**Indian man:**
No, sir. I have been begging. I've been begging people. Now I know that two American people will become steadfast, and I will make sure that they join the movement, but among the Indian people...

**Prabhupāda:**
Whether you have joined?

**Indian man:**
I have joined. I'm a Life Member. I come to the temple. I study your books all the time. I have your photo. I do your //ārati// every day without fail. Without fail. Nayanābhirāma came to my house two weeks ago, and I showed him everything, Kṛṣṇa and your photo next to it, and I every day do //pūjā.// Complete vegetarian, and we are doing //ārati// every day, first obeisances to you, my father-mother, and Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Your father-mother here?

**Indian man:**
No, sir. They are dead now. They have expired. But I still offer my obeisances to them. First obeisances to you, then to Kṛṣṇa, then to my father-mother, and then I start my //pūjā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That's...

**Indian man:**
And I do complete //ārati// and everything, because I want your blessings. I wish that I have a //guru// like you every birth after birth. But one of the problem, Prabhupāda, personally, I have found among the Indian people is that because we are used to so many demigods, they still don't accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There are so many arguments I get that like...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no question of argument. It is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// but if they do not accept //Bhagavad-gītā// as the authority, then they are fools.

**Indian man:**
Yes, they are.

**Prabhupāda:**
So fools cannot be enlightened. That is the difficulty.

**Indian man:**
And this is one of the biggest problems.

**Prabhupāda:**
If they do not accept the authority, then they are fools.

**Indian man:**
Yes. After I teach //Gītā// and I try to tell them to please sing //bhajan...//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not their fault. Even the big, big leaders of India, even Gandhi, they do not know actually. Therefore we are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. The //Bhagavad-gītā// has been misinterpreted, misused by the leaders, by the politicians, by the so-called philosophers. Everyone has misused //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Indian man:**
I'll tell you one thing, that Swami Chinmayananda...

**Prabhupāda:**
He's a great...

**Indian man:**
He's great, but I'll tell you what happened.

**Prabhupāda:**
"Great" means great fool.

**Indian man:**
Yes. In Third Chapter where Kṛṣṇa is saying, "Renounce your everything to Me." Okay? And the word //matam// is used, //matam.// Now Swami Chinmayananda is saying, "That's My opinion," that's what Kṛṣṇa is telling, and they will be freed of all the work. And you have written //matam// means scriptural injunctions. And I tried to show the students who come to the class that "This is the difference. Look at this, very big difference," because if Kṛṣṇa is only giving His opinion, then He's talking like a diplomat, not talking like God. But if He says, "This is the law..." And I explained to them that like Bible has got ten commandments...

**Prabhupāda:**
And another thing, even Kṛṣṇa says, giving His opinion---that's taking it as it is---Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. So He's the supreme authority. So supreme authority's //matam// is a high court judgment. There is no argument anyone. The judgment is given by the high court. Final decision. So if Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, then who can give him better opinion than Him? For argument's sake, even if He says... Any gentleman will say like that, that... Just like Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You do it." He is Supreme Lord, He can force you, but He does not do that. So although His //matam// is the Supreme, but as a gentle preacher, He says, "That is My //matam.//" But if you are sane, if you know that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme authority, then His //matam// is final.

**Indian man:**
Right. And that's why I try to show the difference to people, that "Please follow Prabhupāda's //Gītā.// And please make sure that when you read, you read //Gītā As It Is.//" This is why I'm trying to show the differences to people. Personally there is only one question I have, and that is, throughout all the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatams// that you have translated so far, I see all the time any, like Kardama Muni or other, all other great sages, whenever they do //tapasya,// every time Mahā-Viṣṇu comes down. Now I know that throughout other..., even //Back to Godhead,// you have considered Mahā-Viṣṇu as an expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Yet Mahā-Viṣṇu is coming every time as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So what is the subtle position here?

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no difference between... Just like... It has been explained in the //Brahma-saṁhitā.// Just like one candle, then you kindle another candle, then you kindle another, another, another, another. So you say, "This is first, this is second, this is third, this is fourth." But so far candlepower is concerned, they are all the same. Either you take first or the second or the third, so far the candlepower is concerned, that is all the same. Still, you have to say, "This is first, this is second, that is third, this is fourth, this is..."

**Indian man:**
I was trying to... I was trying...

**Prabhupāda:**
So God and His different expansions, they are of same power. //Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu, kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo...//

**Indian man:**
//...govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So He is existing with all the incarnations, //rāmādi-mūrtiṣu.//

**Indian man:**
Yes, even Rāmacandra is...

**Prabhupāda:**
So Rāma is not less than Kṛṣṇa, but He is incarnation. This is the conclusion.

**Indian man:**
Because I was trying to refer to //Govindāṣṭakam,// where it says, [sings] //śrī kṛṣṇa rādhā āra gokuleśa gopāla govardhana-nātha viṣṇu, jīveti amṛtamedhadevo govindaṁ dāmodaram ada vetti//[?]. He's saying, //śrī kṛṣṇa rādhā āra gokuleśa gopāla govardhana-nātha viṣṇu.// That is what I was trying to see that is really... I know that Kṛṣṇa's expansion is Mahā-Viṣṇu, but still, why do they say //govardhana-nātha viṣṇu?// That's what I was trying to understand. Please don't misunderstand me. I am trying to understand from you.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, Govardhana... Every one is //viṣṇu-tattva. Viṣṇu-tattva, jīva-tattva, śakti-tattva,// like that. So all of them on the Viṣṇu category. That's all. //Viṣṇu-tayā vibhāti. Viṣṇu-tayā vibhāti. Dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya dīpāyate viṣṇu-tayā vibhāti// [Bs. 5.46]. These things are there. So Godhead is //viṣṇu-tattva.// So sometimes Viṣṇu, sometimes Nārāyaṇa, sometimes Govinda, sometimes Kṛṣṇa, like that.

**Indian man:**
That's very nice, because one can understand very well. Because I always took Mahā-Viṣṇu as the expansion of Kṛṣṇa, but still, when I went to //Govindāṣṭakam// and then also like //Brahma-saṁhitā// says, //yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā...// [Bs. 5.48].

**Prabhupāda:**
//...loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ.//

**Indian man:**
//...jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ, viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya// [Prabhupāda quotes same verse simultaneously] //kalā-viśeṣo govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// So he says Mahā-Viṣṇu is even one expansion of Kṛṣṇa, yet in //Govindāṣṭakam// they say, //govardhana..., gopāla govardhana-nātha viṣṇu, śrī kṛṣṇa rādhā gokuleśa, gopāla govardhana-nātha viṣṇu.//

**Prabhupāda:**
They're all //viṣṇu-tattva. Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma-stotra.//

**Indian man:**
Because many people in... At least, among the Indians I get very big argument about it, that it is Mahā-Viṣṇu who is Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Kṛṣṇa is only one //avatāra// of His. And I try to...

**Prabhupāda:**
That argument is discussed in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//

**Hari-śauri:**
First volume?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, first volume you see. See the contents. You can't find it? When he is discussing, somebody, says Viṣṇu is the origin? So children, how many?

**Indian man:**
No children.

**Prabhupāda:**
No children.

**Indian man:**
No children

**Prabhupāda:**
That is good than another. [laughs] No responsibility.

**Indian man:**
I have decided that in about five, ten years, I'll work that much only. Afterwards I'm going to go to work for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you.

**Indian man:**
Because I don't find any more pleasures, you know, in anything. As I go on chanting and chanting and chanting, sometime, Prabhupāda... Oh, my first dream that came when I joined your movement... First dream that I came... And I told my wife about it in the morning. I said, first I saw a moon, and then I saw another large planet coming up, and then on the top of it I saw the lotus feet of the Lord. And when I saw the lotus feet of the Lord, I saw you coming on a swan and doing His //pūjā.// And I kept on shouting to my wife that "Please see, Prabhupāda is here. Please see. He is doing //pūjā// of lotus feet of the Lord." And that was my first dream that came. Sometimes after chanting all the time I feel as if He is walking next to me. I can feel as if His bluish body is right next to me, and all the time I have a feeling that somebody is next to me, you know. I don't know whether I'm going crazy or I'm...

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa is already there. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. [Tamāla Kṛṣṇa enters] So?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So I asked, I took a poll, census poll of about six or seven GBC men, including Kīrtanānanda, Rāmeśvara, Bali-mardana, so many men who know New York, and they all thought that if you join the parade at Twenty-third Street...

**Prabhupāda:**
Twenty-third. At what time?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Ah, it'll be... It should be at about 3:15, like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Then it will be nice. Because the whole parade is about fifty-four blocks, and you'll be riding for about nineteen blocks. It means your ride will take about forty-five minutes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what time I'll have to start?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
From here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Somebody will come?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, I think I will probably come. Kīrtanānanda will also...

**Prabhupāda:**
At what time?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think, say, it's going to be either 2:45 or 3:00. Tomorrow morning I'll let you know.

**Prabhupāda:**
So at 3:00 I shall be ready. You can come and take me. That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, I think at 3:00... But then by the time we get in the car... I think it will work, 3:00 o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Three o'clock, I'll be ready. You come and take. In the meantime, I shall finish my...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, that will leave a little time for resting. The whole program should be over by about...

**Prabhupāda:**
So tomorrow I shall take lunch at 1:00.

**Hari-śauri:**
One o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. Then, by 3:00 o'clock, I shall be ready.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[to Indian man:] //Thik hai.// Kṛṣṇa is preparing you to join this movement wholeheartedly. It is very nice. [to devotee:] Now you have got it?

**Jayādvaita:**
Yes. Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja quotes, //ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]: "All these incarnations of Godhead are either plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions of the //puruṣa-avatāras,// but Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself." Then he says, "The //Bhāgavatam// describes the symptoms and deeds of the incarnations in general and counts Śrī Kṛṣṇa among them. This made Sūta Gosvāmī greatly apprehensive. Therefore he distinguished each incarnation by its specific symptom. All the incarnations of Godhead are plenary portions or parts of the plenary portions of the //puruṣa-avatāras,// but the primeval Lord is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the fountainhead of all incarnations. An opponent may say, 'This is your interpretation, but actually the Supreme Lord is Nārāyaṇa, who is in the transcendental realm. He, Nārāyaṇa, incarnates as Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is the meaning of the verse as I see it. There is no need for further consideration.' To such a misguided interpreter we may reply, 'Why should you suggest such fallacious logic? An interpretation is never accepted as evidence if it opposes the principle of scripture. One should not state a predicate before its subject, for it cannot thus stand without proper support.' If I do not state a subject, I do not state a predicate. First I speak the former and then the latter. The predicate of a sentence is what is unknown to the reader, whereas the subject is what is known to him. For example, we may say, 'This //vipra// is a greatly learned man.' In this sentence, the //vipra// is the subject, and the predicate is his erudition. The man's being a //vipra// is known, but his erudition is unknown. Therefore the person is identified first and his erudition later. In the same way, all these incarnations were known, but whose incarnations they are was unknown. First the word //ete,// 'these,' establishes the subject, the incarnations. Then 'plenary portions of the //puruṣa-avatāras//' follows as the predicate. In the same way, when Kṛṣṇa was first counted among the incarnations, specific knowledge about Him was still unknown. Therefore the word //Kṛṣṇa// appears as the subject, followed by the predicate, describing Him as the original Personality of Godhead. This establishes that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the original Personality of Godhead. The original Personality of Godhead is therefore necessarily Kṛṣṇa. Had Kṛṣṇa been the plenary portion and Nārāyaṇa the primeval Lord, the statement of Sūta Gosvāmī would have been reversed. Thus he would have said, 'Nārāyaṇa, the source of all incarnations, is the original Personality of Godhead. He has appeared as Śrī Kṛṣṇa.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
So everything is given with logic and argument. //Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. First of all He's grouped among the incarnations, but Kṛṣṇa is not incarnation. He's //bhagavān svayam.//

**Indian man:**
He comes original.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So if you argue against the authority of //Bhāgavatam,// then that argument has no value.

**Indian man:**
That's where the problem in India occuring. Everyone is saying God is Mahā-Viṣṇu, and Kṛṣṇa and Rāma are only //avatāras,// and that's where the big argument came in. In fact, I talked to so many...

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise why Sūta Gosvāmī, //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]? And Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. So how one can say like that? That means less intelligent. If Kṛṣṇa... If one accepts the authority of //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. //Aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. Then how they falsely say? //Aham ādir hi devānām.// Find out this verse.

**Hari-śauri:**

> na me viduḥ sura-gaṇāḥ
> prabhavaṁ na maharṣayaḥ
> aham ādir hi devānāṁ
> maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ
> [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sarvaśaḥ.// [Hindi]

**Indian man:**
No. Never. He has no reason to cheat us. He has no reason to lie.

**Hari-śauri:**
Shall I read the...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Um-hmm.

**Hari-śauri:**
"Neither the hosts of demigods nor the great sages know My origin, for, in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages." Purport?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
"As stated in //Brahma-saṁhitā,// Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. No one is greater than Him; He is the cause of all causes. Here it is also stated by the Lord personally that He is the cause of all the demigods and the sages. Even the demigods and great sages cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. They can neither understand His name nor His personality, so what is the position of the so-called scholars of this tiny planet? No one can understand why the Supreme God comes to earth as an ordinary human being and executes such commonplace and yet wonderful activities. One should know, then, that scholarship is not the qualification necessary to understand Kṛṣṇa. Even the demigods and the great sages have tried to understand Kṛṣṇa by their mental speculation, and they have failed to do so. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// also it is stated clearly that even the great demigods are not able to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They can speculate to the limits of their imperfect senses and can reach the opposite conclusion of impersonalism, of something not manifested by the three qualities of material nature. Or they can imagine something by mental speculation. But it is not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa by such foolish speculation.

"Here the Lord indirectly says that if anyone wants to know the Absolute Truth, 'Here I am, present as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. I am the Supreme.' One should know this. Although one cannot understand the inconceivable Lord who is personally present, He nonetheless exists. We can actually understand Kṛṣṇa, who is eternal, full of bliss and knowledge, simply by studying His words in //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The impersonal Brahman can be conceived by persons who are already in the inferior energy of the Lord, but the Personality of Godhead cannot be conceived unless one is in the transcendental position. Because most men cannot understand Kṛṣṇa in His actual situation, out of His causeless mercy He descends to show favor to such speculators. Yet despite the Supreme Lord's uncommon activities, these speculators, due to contamination in the material energy, still think that the impersonal Brahman is the Supreme. Only the devotees, who are fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord, can understand, by the grace of the Lord, that He is Kṛṣṇa. The devotees of the Lord do not bother about the impersonal Brahman conception of God. Their faith and devotion bring them to surrender immediately unto the Supreme Lord, and out of the causeless mercy of Kṛṣṇa, they can understand Kṛṣṇa. No one else can understand Him. So even great sages agree, 'What is //ātmā?// What is the Supreme? It is He whom we have to worship.' "

**Indian man:**
In my class I run into lot of arguments, especially from our Indian people, and this is one of the biggest arguments that people pose. They say, "Why are you calling yourselves Vaiṣṇavas and not Kṛṣṇayas?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Indian man:**
If I call Kṛṣṇa..., I accept Kṛṣṇa as Supreme Personality of Godhead, then the question comes to me, "Why are you calling yourself Vaiṣṇavas? Why not Kṛṣṇayas?"

**Prabhupāda:**
That already is explained, that Kṛṣṇa or Rāma, Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa, They are all //viṣṇu-tattva.// Therefore Viṣṇu is the common word for everyone. Just like candle. Everyone is candle, but still, this is first candle, this is second candle, this is third candle, like that. So Godhead means all //viṣṇu-tattva.// They are not //jīva-tattva.// So therefore those who are devotee of God, they are called Vaiṣṇava.

**Hari-śauri:**
This specific word Vaiṣṇava, that refers to Viṣṇu? Worshipers of Viṣṇu?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Viṣṇu asya devataḥ iti vaiṣṇavaḥ.//

**Indian man:**
Throughout //Vedas// also, Viṣṇu is the //yajñeśvara.//

**Prabhupāda:**
The supreme, yes.

**Indian man:**
//Yajño vai viṣṇuḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Viṣṇur ārādhyate. Viṣṇur ārādhyate, nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam. Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. //Viṣṇor ārādhanam. Ārādhanānāṁ sarveṣāṁ viṣṇor ārādhanaṁ param.// These are the śāstric..., that //viṣṇor ārādhana. Kṛṣṇa-ārādhana// is also //viṣṇu-ārādhana.//

**Indian man:**
In fact, even //Brahma-saṁhitā,// Brahmājī says,

> yaḥ kāraṇārṇava-jale bhajati sma yoga-
> nidrām ananta-jagad-aṇḍa-saroma-kūpaḥ
> ādhāra-śaktim avalambya parāṁ sva-mūrtiṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.47]

So "Viṣṇu is creating all the planetary systems. He's in His //yoga-nidrā.// He is the original Govinda, and I worship Him." So that is why both names are used so synonymously. And that is why people are questioning me, and I have difficulty to answer them. Although I accept Kṛṣṇa as original Personality of Godhead, but how to explain to them?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, these are the references.

**Jayādvaita:**
In here also. Should I read the verse? "All other incarnations are potentially situated in the original body of the primeval Lord. Thus, according to one's opinion, one may address Him as any one of the incarnations." Purport: "It is not contradictory for a devotee to call the Supreme Lord by any one of the various names of His plenary expansions, because the original Personality of Godhead includes all such categories. Since the plenary expansions exist within the original person, one may call Him by any of these names. In //Śrī Caitanya-bhāgavata// Lord Caitanya says, 'I was lying asleep in the ocean of milk, but I was wakened by the call of Nāḍā, Śrī Advaita Prabhu.' Here the Lord refers to His form as Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu."

Translation: "Some say that Śrī Kṛṣṇa is directly Nara-Nārāyaṇa, others say that He is directly Vāmana. Some say that Kṛṣṇa is the incarnation of Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. None of these statements is impossible. Each of them is as correct as the others."

Purport: "//Laghu-bhāgavatāmṛta// states,

> ataeva purāṇādau kecin nara-sakhātmatāṁ
> mahendrānujatāṁ kecit kecit kṣīrābdhi-śāyitām
> sahasra-śīrṣatāṁ kecit kecid vaikuṇṭha-nāthatāṁ
> brūyuḥ kṛṣṇasya munayas tat-tad-vṛtty-anugāminaḥ

'According to the intimate relationships between Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the primeval Lord, and His devotees, the //Purāṇas// describe Him by various names. Sometimes He is called Nārāyaṇa; sometimes Upendra [Vāmana], the younger brother of Indra, King of heaven; and sometimes Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Sometimes He is called...' "

**Prabhupāda:**
They are all //viṣṇu-tattva.//

**Indian man:**
In fact, I remember very vividly that in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// you wrote that it was Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu who came down to bless Dhruva Mahārāja when the planetary system started trembling due to his //tapasya.// Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. This is why people are questioning me continuously, that "How can you call Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and not Viṣṇu?" And I say "All are //viṣṇu-tattva.//" But it is very difficult to explain to them the actual position of Kṛṣṇa, because only through chanting...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is decided by //Bhāgavatam, ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. That //tu,// the name Kṛṣṇa, in the incarnation of God, Kṛṣṇa is also included, but this Kṛṣṇa is the origin.

**Indian man:**

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

**Prabhupāda:**
So we have to take the direction. So that is also explained. Even if you say, "Kṛṣṇa is Vāmana," there is nothing wrong. If you believe that Kṛṣṇa is incarnation of Viṣṇu, there is nothing wrong.

**Indian man:**
I don't believe that.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, others. Others...

**Indian man:**
I believe Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**Prabhupāda:**
Others. We simply accept, "Yes, it is all right." That's all. So that's a fact, because when Kṛṣṇa comes, He comes through Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu.

**Indian man:**
I ask them then that "Explain the three Viṣṇus---Mahā Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Even Viṣṇu Himself has expanded, what to talk of Kṛṣṇa." And then I ask them that "Kṛṣṇa came from which Viṣṇu? You tell me. If you can tell me that, then I will accept that Kṛṣṇa came from Viṣṇu. But if not, you have to accept my statement that Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead. And you will not know Him unless you chant. Unless you chant."

**Prabhupāda:**
Sometimes Mahā-Viṣṇu wanted to see Kṛṣṇa. That is mentioned in the //Bhāgavata,// and He took Arjuna with Him.

**Indian man:**
That's right. That's right. My father-mother did their entire lifetime //pūjā// of Śrīnāthajī, Śrīnāthajī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Śrīnāthajī is Gopāla.

**Indian man:**
Śrīnāthajī, we consider Him as Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, He is Kṛṣṇa. He's our Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava. It is decided by the court. Śrīnāthajī, there are... Mādhavendra Purī's worshipable Gopāla... He discovered Gopāla in Govardhana. That Gopāla was delivered to... Who is the //ācārya?// Vallabhācārya. And it is decided by the court that Śrīnāthajī originally belongs to Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava. By the court. This Mādhavendra Purī is the spiritual master of Īśvara Purī. And Īśvara Purī is the spiritual master of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So from Mādhavendra Purī is Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava. So his Deity is Gopāla. That Gopāla is Śrīnāthajī.

**Indian man:**
When I was a young boy, eight years old, I went to Śrīnāthajī with my father-mother, and there I had to take the //brahma-samāna//[?], //brahma-smārana,// which is the oath, taking of the oath in front of the Mahārāja and the priest of the Śrīnāthajī temple. And is that equal unto initiation, or is that just a ceremony by itself?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, initiation is another ceremony.

**Indian man:**
What are the qualifications required for a person in working life like me, household like me, like myself, to get initiated?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you can be initiated. There is no... Because you are following the rules and regulations. That's it. We initiate a person who follows the rules and regulations.

**Indian man:**
I am following all your rules and regulations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you can be initiated.

**Indian man:**
Yes. I think we have taken enough of your time, Prabhupāda. I would love to stay with you, and I would like to invite you to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Why don't you stay here in our temple?

**Indian man:**
Probably I might. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We have got ladies' department and gentleman's department. You can stay.

**Indian man and wife:**
I would like to invite you to Poughkeepsie and stay with us if it is possible.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. How long it is?

**Indian man:**
Hundred miles north from here.

**Prabhupāda:**
So by car?

**Indian man:**
Yes, by car.

**Prabhupāda:**
It will take about four, five hours.

**Indian man:**
No, two and a half hours. Two and a half hours.

**Prabhupāda:**
Traveling is little difficult for me. So there are many Indians?

**Indian man:**
There are about hundred and fifty Indian people. Thirty percent of them are Ārya-samājīsts. They don't believe in anyone except doing //havanas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Second edition of Muhammadans.

**Indian man:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ārya-samājī means another edition of the Muhammadans.

**Indian man:**
Some are Śiva followers, Śaivaites, of South India.

**Prabhupāda:**
The Ārya-samājīs, they do not believe in God, so how they are Śiva followers? Hodgepodge. No //sāmajīs,// but hodgepodge.

**Indian man:**
Yes, it is. They don't know what is Personality of Godhead.

**Prabhupāda:**
Opportunity followers.

**Indian man:**
Hodgepodge, that's right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Opportunists. Useless. They have no value.

**Indian man:**
Thirty percent of the Indian families, they are Ārya-samājīsts, and twenty percent are South Indian Śaivaites. I get a lot of argument that "Rāmacandrajī did the //pūjā// of Śivajī at Rāmeśvaram, so Śiva is greater than Rāma." I said, "Consider this, that Rāma was so humble to do the //pūjā// of Śivajī, but in //Rāmastotrāṇi// it says, //rāma rāmeti rāmeti rāmerāma manorāne, śāstranāma tat tulyam śrī-rāma-nāma rāmarāme.//[?] That is what Śivajī is telling Pārvatī. Śivajī is telling Pārvatī in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya, vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]." I say, "Why does Śivajī say that? Why is Śivajī sitting in //samādhi?// Why not Kṛṣṇa sitting in //samādhi?// Why not Rāma sitting in //samādhi?// Why not Mahā-Viṣṇu sitting in //samādhi?// Because Śivajī's position is to serve Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa as Rāma is so humble that He came and even did His devotee's //pūjā.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like Kṛṣṇa is afraid of mother Yaśodā's rope. But that does not mean He is no longer the Supreme Lord.

**Indian man:**
Exactly, exactly, exactly.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's afraid of "Mother, don't bind Me." So everyone is afraid of Kṛṣṇa, and He is afraid of His mother's rope. So does it mean Kṛṣṇa has become no more the Supreme?

**Indian man:**
In fact, you might have heard of Satya Sai Baba in India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man:**
Now there are some people in our community there at Poughkeepsie, they are all followers of Satya Sai Baba, and they've been telling me that "Anyone you pray, Kṛṣṇa, Rāma, Viṣṇu, it comes to Satya Sai Baba." I said, "Don't tell me that nonsense," I said. [laughter] "Satya Sai Baba is not Kṛṣṇa, and don't tell me that." In fact for //Guru Pūrṇimā// they invited me to Satya Sai Baba's //bhajanas.// I said, "No, I have my //guru.// I'm very happy. Don't disturb me. I have Kṛṣṇa, I have my //guru,// and I have my path. I don't have to go to anybody's //guru,// and I don't have to take anyone's teachings." I say, "My //Gītā// is here, written by Prabhupāda. I follow it, and that's it. I don't have to have extraordinary brains to follow everyone's //Gītā// or everything else. Here is my path."

**Prabhupāda:**
In South America there was a great criticism?

**Hari-śauri:**
South Africa.

**Prabhupāda:**
South Africa.

**Indian man:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Of Satya Sai.

**Hari-śauri:**
One man, he challenged that he could prove that Sai Baba is a fake. So he's written so many letters to Sai Baba to challenge him, but he's never received a reply. So that paper gave this article criticizing Sai Baba like that, and other //gurus,// and then in the same paper there was a very nice article concerning our Jagannātha Cart Festival. So practically they were appreciating that Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is bona fide and these other people are nonsense.

**Indian man:**
Right. In fact, several people, even in our community in Poughkeepsie, received letters from Satya Sai Baba's followers that "Here is a letter. Make ten copies and send the ten copies to ten different people. If you don't, Satya Sai Baba's thunderbolt will come and strike your family, and they'll be destroyed." Now no //guru// ever puts a thunderbolt on his devotee, and I said, "If that is a //guru,// I'll stay ten thousand miles away from him, because my //guru// is very kind and he'll bless me." I said, "No //guru// should ever put a thunderbolt on his devotee."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. [aside:] You can turn towards this.

**Indian man:**
At Monticello in Catskill... I don't know if you know it. Monticello in Catskill Mountains here? Just about fifty-sixty miles north, there is Muktananda.

**Hari-śauri:**
Muktananda.

**Indian man:**
Muktananda. And he has got his retreat, and some of our people go there. And I heard from them that he is teaching..., he is quoting //Gītā.// But if you go to his room, //oṁ namaḥ śivāya.// I said, "This is contradiction." I said, "If he is a Śiva follower, he should teach //Śiva Purāṇa// and not //Gītā.//" I said this is...

**Prabhupāda:**
But they are actually impersonalists. They neither follow Śiva nor Kṛṣṇa. They are impersonalists.

**Indian man:**
Hypocrites.

**Prabhupāda:**
Their idea is the Absolute Truth is imperson. You can worship Him either as Śiva or as Kṛṣṇa, as you like. That is their philosophy. Yes.

**Indian man:**
Yes. But this is the height of hypocrisy, to teach //Gītā// and to chant //oṁ namaḥ śivāya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, because they say, "Either way, you become impersonal at the end. You //brahma-liṅ.// You become one with Brahma. But before you become //brahma-liṅ,// you can imagine some form, either Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu or Śiva or Durgā, the same thing." That is their...

**Indian man:**
In fact some of the arguments that I received were... "If you go to heaven, let's say, Vaikuṇṭha, then you become..., you join the impersonal Brahman. Then you have nothing else to do." He says, "In material world we have family. We have something to do." I said, "If you believe in impersonalism, you have nothing to do. If you believe in personalism, you will serve the Lord there."

**Prabhupāda:**
Impersonal means if you have nothing to do, then you'll become mad.

**Indian man:**
Exactly.

**Prabhupāda:**
And again you come back to this material world.

**Indian man:**
Exactly. Now, Prabhupāda, I have taken too much of your time. I want to thank you very much. I humbly offer my obeisances.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you very much.

**Indian man:**
I wish that I can continue your work.

**Prabhupāda:**
Please do. You'll be happy. Kṛṣṇa will make you happy.

**Indian man:**
And huh...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kas...// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. [break] [end]
