**Prabhupāda:**
...7-UP with ice.

**Hari-śauri:**
7-UP? We'll have to send someone out for it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Rādhā-vallabha should go.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, so far I was there, it was successful. What was the next?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, we were selling //prasādam.// I think we must have made somewhere between five and ten thousand dollars so far from //prasādam// sales. That's in addition to the free feast. We served a free feast to five thousand people when I left.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you did not stay there?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, still..., it's so big. I estimated that through three to four hours there were thirty to forty thousand people that went in and out of that park.

**Prabhupāda:**
Still they are eating?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They're still eating. Every piece of //burfī// we sold cost one dollar.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Just a piece of //burfī...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Burfī?//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, they were charging one dollar for one square.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] That is good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And they were paying. Watermelon, for one slice, half a dollar.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fifty cents. [laughs]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Fifty cents. The whole watermelon only cost one dollar. We got about thirty slices out of it. And books...

**Prabhupāda:**
People, they are simple here. They are not, about money matters, so much anxiety. They have got enough money that they don't care. They want, it is good taste, that's all. And why they did not give //prasādam// to that boy who was crazy [indistinct]?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He got. I'm sure he must have gotten. Everybody was given free feast. Feast was very good. I tasted it. It was nicely prepared.

**Prabhupāda:**
How many preparations were there?

**Bali-mardana:**
Very hard to estimate.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many preparations in the feast? There was //halavā, sabjī,// very good //sabjī// by Ṛṣi Kumāra, rice, sweet, lemonade, popper---six preps. And //purī,// seven preps.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice. Very good preps, sumptuous.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, yes. Besides that, we had booths with watermelon, //lassī// and //burfī.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Lassī// was selling very big. We could not supply it fast enough.

**Bali-mardana:**
We could not... All the time, those booths, there was a line.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Because this was our first year, we were not expecting such a big turnout, so we did not have sufficient stands to meet everybody's needs.

**Prabhupāda:**
And the police officer has approved.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, the policemen sat down at the end of the park later on.

**Prabhupāda:**
You gave them //prasādam?//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'm not sure. I didn't deal with them. They were dealt with by Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa. We'll bring them some present tomorrow. But they made the statement that "If every parade was so beautiful and so nicely orderly, we would be very happy."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They said it was very orderly.

**Prabhupāda:**
And that cannot be expected from any other group, only in this group. Such a huge crowd, and there was not a single instance of violence.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Except that one time. One boy was punched out.

**Hari-śauri:**
[referring to 7-UP] I sent someone out.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The procession was very well attended.

**Prabhupāda:**
Television.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, yes. ABC, CBS and Channel Five.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All of the GBC men said it was the biggest single festival ever held in ISKCON's history. They all admitted that there was no festival ever held anywhere, even in India, no single festival in India. There was not any one day at any //paṇḍāl// where there was that many people who took //prasādam// and who attended such a long procession for two hours.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think in the beginning... [indistinct---microphone rattling] You were there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I was there. Yeah, that was pretty big, in 1969. That was gigantic.

**Prabhupāda:**
That was also very big. And there was also a crazy man. [laughs]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, that's right. We didn't give any invitation cards to our temple here, but we were making announcements. But I think people will come, anyway. They'll find out where our Hare Kṛṣṇa center is.

**Bali-mardana:**
They were distributing books, magazines.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Books and magazines were given, but we didn't give any free cards. Usually we give free cards, but there was so much...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that? They'll come and take. That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They'll come here, anyway. We didn't give any address card. Do you think people will come anyway?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Even without getting a card.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, this is better, to give a card. Many Indians were standing when I came.

**Bali-mardana:**
Did you see the Indians?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think at least three thousand Indians attended, minimum. A huge crowd of Indians. But the big thing was not the Indians, it was the American people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's a good location for the festival, very important place, Washington Square Park. It's the center.

**Prabhupāda:**
Best thing would have been to keep the deities for a week there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That would not have been permitted. They only permitted us legally two hours for everything. That's why we were rushing everything. We only had two hours legally for the whole program.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, then there is no need.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I heard people say, "We've never seen such a festival, never seen such a parade." I heard these comments. One man said... Someone said, "What's going on?" and he said, "Oh, they have so many things going on here." They were very appreciative. And actually we could not put our full energy into it this year because we were so busy preparing the building simultaneously.

**Prabhupāda:**
And above all, the atmosphere, the weather, was very nice.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, yes, Kṛṣṇa has blessed us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [laughs] The breeze was there. We did not feel any...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No discomfort.

**Prabhupāda:**
...fatigue.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And there was nearly four hundred to five hundred devotees there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They will stay in the temple?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, they've been staying here.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's no difficulty to accommodate them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Nārāyaṇa[?] told me also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You know, Prabhupāda, I really feel like I should concentrate a lot of my preaching here in New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What do you think?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Preaching is required, here or there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You once said, "A good businessman, if he knows how to do it, he can make more money sitting in one place..."

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no. Money is not our aim. Our aim is how people will understand Kṛṣṇa.

**Bali-mardana:**
He is just using that as an analogy for preaching.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That if you have a good place, many people can be attracted, as many as moving around to many places.

**Prabhupāda:**
My Guru Mahārāja was in favor of preaching in the city because you can get many men.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But do you think I should travel a lot, or what is the best thing?

**Prabhupāda:**
Both things should be done.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Both. So if you... We will try to, er... We were hoping that you could give us another chance by coming back next year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. I'll come.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But you do say that to a lot of different temples. But we will try to make this doubly big.

**Prabhupāda:**
Normal, so long I live, I must come.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Really?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If we get on Fifth Avenue, you'll come again?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But we will double the amount of people, promise.

**Bali-mardana:**
And double the //prasādam.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We will double everything if you are here, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. I can stay here also. I like especially New York, because I started the movement here. And because there are so many branches, if I go they'll become enlivened.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, right, just like we are enlivened.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone wants.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Everyone wants you to come.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is natural.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Question of love.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
New York was your second home after India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I say fatherland. India, motherland; this is fatherland.

**Bali-mardana:**
It is so nice that now in New York they are receiving you so nicely, this parade. Everyone is turning out to greet you. You are like the local boy who made good. So now they are receiving you very grandly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, continue this program. People will be appreciative.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I was thinking that we could make a point to have many big festivals here each year, not just this one, but many.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, at least three, four you can do. On Janmāṣṭamī, one; Gaura Pūrṇimā; for Śrī Rāma-navamī; and one, Ratha-yātrā.

**Bali-mardana:**
We can do New York for the spring, summer and fall.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Because the weather is nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That coincides. Rāma-navamī is spring, Ratha-yātrā is summer, and Janmāṣṭamī is fall.

**Hari-śauri:**
Gaura Pūrṇimā would be a bit difficult, though. Everybody is in India.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's not possible.

**Bali-mardana:**
We could do that inside.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But those three...

**Prabhupāda:**
Janmāṣṭamī, take Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa procession.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
On carts?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, on //siṁhāsana,// carried by hand.

**Bali-mardana:**
Palanquin.

**Prabhupāda:**
Palanquin, yes; no, the //siṁhāsana// as it is. Just like this is //siṁhāsana,// two big poles down, and tie it with..., cut it with legs and carry, four men or eight men change. Change the soldiers.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But not on carts, not on big chariot.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Chariot, only Ratha-yātrā.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We'll make a big advertisement. We'll call it "Fall Festival." This festival, we called it "Summer Festival." See, people respond to that. If you say Ratha-yātrā, they can't even pronounce the word. So we call it "Summer Festival," and they came.

**Hari-śauri:**
"Summer Festival" sounds very attractive.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Everyone was saying, "Oh, that means for me, Summer Festival."

**Hari-śauri:**
"Ecstasy Outdoors."

**Prabhupāda:**
And Jayānanda should be congratulated.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You should give one letter, written. I...

**Bali-mardana:**
The carts looked magnificent.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Two people worked the hardest, Prabhupāda: Jayānanda and all of his assistants, and Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa. He did all of the publicity and advertising.

**Prabhupāda:**
They should be congratulated.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These two men, they worked the hardest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They worked for two months in a row, solid. The carts were very good, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes, very nice, very strong.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Big. Strong. Because you gave him that warning. When he heard that, oh, he became very... "I must do it right." We told him, "Now you will have to be replaced. Prabhupāda has said that 'Jayānanda's wheels will never hold up.' So we have to find a replacement for you." [Prabhupāda chuckles] So he took no chances.

**Prabhupāda:**
In San Francisco it also happened.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Seems to me that he must be a great devotee of Lord Jagannātha.

**Prabhupāda:**
Same thing happened in London also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Really? The legs, wheels.

**Hari-śauri:**
That's why they gave difficulty, the authorities, because the wheels broke?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is wrong idea.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, that happened, though. I remember hearing about it. This Jayānanda, it seems, must be a very faithful devotee of Lord Jagannātha.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, where these things will be kept?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In our garage. No problem. That's one of the advantages of our garage. It's one block away and it has ten thousand square foot area, so we can store all the carts easily.

**Hari-śauri:**
Good storage is very important.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And one block away in Manhattan is very unusual.

**Prabhupāda:**
Be careful that termite may not attack.

**Bali-mardana:**
Termites.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hmm. I'll make a note.

**Bali-mardana:**
There are not many termites in New York. We are fortunate. In Hawaii there are many termites. But here you don't have to usually protect wood against termites. Here the wintertime kills them, it gets so cold.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes, very cold.

**Hari-śauri:**
That kills them.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There were devotees from Miami, Gainesville, Atlanta, Washington, Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, Toronto, Montreal, Los Angeles, Vancouver...

**Hari-śauri:**
South America

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
South America---all over South America, they came from. A gigantic turnout of devotees. Very international group.

**Bali-mardana:**
This could be like Lord Caitanya used to invite all His devotees to come and see Him at Ratha-yātrā...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Similarly, if you come here, we can invite...

**Prabhupāda:**
I'll come.

**Bali-mardana:**
...from all the temples.

**Prabhupāda:**
I'll come.

**Bali-mardana:**
Then you do not have to travel so much.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And we will make all arrangements. This year is nothing. Next year we will make ten times more arrangements if you come, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
From anywhere, I will come.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We will make all arrangements for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That you do.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This was only a trial.

**Bali-mardana:**
We have to perfect it now. We have learned that many..., certain things did not go as perfectly as they could have, so now we are going to repair and make it perfect.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, by this, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is advertised. Apart from all over the world, at least in New York it is, that "There is some movement."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prominent movement. Fifth Avenue. We were in charge of Fifth Avenue for one day. Practically we were controlling the Fifth Avenue today.

**Hari-śauri:**
Lord Jagannātha was. [laughs]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
If that side we get some small house, so that after going, eight days Jagannātha can remain there and festival going on, and then in the next week return...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How small a house?

**Prabhupāda:**
Just to keep Jagannātha.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, there's your old storefront.

**Prabhupāda:**
What?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about your old storefront, 26 Second Avenue?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is too small.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Too small. I'll immediately get a house.

**Prabhupāda:**
And then you can utilize it for other purposes during the whole year.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, we can keep a downtown center.

**Bali-mardana:**
West Village.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's a first-class place for a center, the West Village. We can make many devotees there. We'll keep a small preaching center, maybe a restaurant, //prasādam// distribution.

**Bali-mardana:**
We'll call it the Guṇḍicā center.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Guṇḍicā. We will call it Guṇḍicā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Guṇḍicā.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, that's a second restaurant. I think we should have a restaurant there, because a restaurant brings in a lot of people. No Deities. We won't install any Deities, just a preaching center, book distribution...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, book distribution, restaurant, pictures...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, lectures three times a week.

**Prabhupāda:**
Records, pictures, yes, like that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Whew! I wish that you could stay here all the time, Prabhupāda, because you could give us so many ideas, and we would simply act on them. If somehow we could convince you to stay here... I wish there was a way. There is no way to keep you here.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I have no objection, but the other people... [laughter]

**Bali-mardana:**
Just like the Marwaris say, "Oh, I have no objection, but my brother, he may have objection."

**Prabhupāda:**
They... Nobody has objection. Simply I am thinking that if I stay in one place and do not see the others...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But this is a very central location.

**Prabhupāda:**
That I shall consider.

**Bali-mardana:**
They may come here. We will make... We have guest rooms.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can make an airline office by which they'll get a reduced rate, and they can travel here---travel agency---and they can come here very inexpensively to visit you, and we can give full accommodation. If somehow we can keep you here, we will do anything required.

**Bali-mardana:**
At least for a few months. That is all.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which month?

**Bali-mardana:**
During the summertime.

**Prabhupāda:**
July?

**Bali-mardana:**
July, August.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Because now it is the rainy season in India.

**Bali-mardana:**
Because we do not want to inconvenience you as far as the weather goes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But I know now, June, even July, August, September now in India is not so good. October is very good in India.

**Bali-mardana:**
September is very pleasant in New York. I think you remember.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These months are very nice. Somehow, if there was some way... I mean, we would preach so hard. At least sixteen hours a day we could work to serve you. I know I would not want to rest even. There must be some way that we can convince you to stay here.

**Bali-mardana:**
Because actually when you come here, you are preaching to millions. These reporters that have come, through them you have been preaching to millions.

**Prabhupāda:**
What about the reporters? They have published something?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now it'll come.

**Bali-mardana:**
The transcripts have been sent to them, so within the next week they should be coming.

**Hari-śauri:**
I think one or two were waiting until after Ratha-yātrā, to give a report on the festival as well.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There were a lot of reporters, and they said that next year... They told us next year they're going to have full television cameras. We're going to have to erect a news, er... What is that called? Press, not a table, but a platform where they're going to put their cameras, and their reporters will sit above the whole crowd. They want to cover it, full. They were very amazed to see such a gigantic festival in New York itself. They never imagined such a thing in New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
The Christian cannot organize. [laughter]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You saw them. The only thing they were carrying was one sign like this. The sign said, "Turn or Burn." It means turn to Jesus or burn. Turn or burn, burn in hell. That's their conception of God. Either God or burn in hell. We could give you a good rest here, also, Prabhupāda, because it's very easy to not... If the devotees could see you on Sunday, just like in the old days in Los Angeles... I mean everything could be very nicely done, and you could still visit the European centers when you finally return to India. I mean they are not making such a big thing that you couldn't come later on. Oh, boy.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] A good canvasser.

**Bali-mardana:**
They say that Tamāla Kṛṣṇa is very convincing. When he wants to persuade someone, the person must do it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, just it would give... There are so many good... Of course, everywhere there are good devotees, but here there are so many strong preachers that if you stay here on the basis that they had to increase their preaching, we would double and triple our preaching. There's no question. We would throw out all considerations of inconvenience to ourselves and simply preach day and night.

**Bali-mardana:**
Especially New York, the people are ready for it. Like today, they have taken part very nicely. Even the policemen.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, they're so favorable. Rāmeśvara was commenting. He said he never saw... The climate of the people of New York is unique in America. They are very favorable.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where is that man? Where he has gone? 7-UP can be had anywhere.

**Hari-śauri:**
Well, it's Sunday evening. It's a bit difficult. He has to drive around in a car till he finds somewhere.

**Bali-mardana:**
7-UP? You want 7-UP? I can get it.

**Hari-śauri:**
I sent Śravaṇānanda out to get it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
At the Bloopie's they can get it. Rādhā-vallabha got it.

**Bali-mardana:**
Not a can, though, just in a cup.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But how do they get it into the cup? Buy the whole bottle.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bottle or... Bottle or can.

**Bali-mardana:**
This store has it... They have the machine.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about Ninth Avenue? There's all those shops.

[whispering in background about 7-UP]

**Bali-mardana:**
He already went to get it?

**Prabhupāda:**
If the government is going against our movement, then I'll have to stay. There is no alternative.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because in that case I'll be hampered in India.

**Bali-mardana:**
He'll be what?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hampered.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, now the government has a policy that anyone they do not like, they put him in jail.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In India.

**Bali-mardana:**
In India. Even that elderly gentleman, Narayan...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jaya Prakash Narayan.

**Bali-mardana:**
...put him in jail. He's so old.

**Prabhupāda:**
The result is that the Congress Party and Indira Gandhi will never be elected anymore. That is sure. Therefore he's postponing election. Now they have lost all their credit. They will never be elected. Congress Party and Indira Gandhi finished. [break]

**Bali-mardana:**
They have lost all respectability.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think that your preaching here in New York... The thing is the preaching...

**Prabhupāda:**
More important.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's more important.

**Prabhupāda:**
I know that.

**Bali-mardana:**
In India they pay more attention to the building than to the person.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Our building can go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You know, Prabhupāda, we have never... I mean, you started this movement here in New York, but this is the first time that we have a proper facility.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, in the last ten years there was no facility.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, Prabhupāda. That's why if you concentrated here, just by your presence, even if you only spoke to a few important gentlemen... We have so many senior men here. We could do wonderful things. Within two or three months we could expand our movement so broadly here in New York, I think the whole country would take note. I really feel that there is a great potential.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's why I'm not very eager to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is fact. Let me see what Kṛṣṇa desires. The roof is very nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
For open air.

**Hari-śauri:**
It's very good for massage.

**Prabhupāda:**
And the view of the river is very healthy. If you can see the river from your house, it is to be understood that quarter is very nice. If you can see sky from your room, then it is to be understood the room is very nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, all these things are here.

**Prabhupāda:**
We can see from the room the river.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise from the roof. So it is very nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think also that right now there's a lot of devotees here, so it's a little taxing, but once the festival's over, they will all be returning to their respective centers. It will be much calmer. [break] In the night?

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not take anything at night.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Morning, you are drinking milk? Is it...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Those cows are unique, that a cow can give her own weight in milk in eleven days.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are selling milk also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In our farm?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, we make fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars a month.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if there is more milk, you can sell more, get money.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, we're getting nearly two thousand dollars a month.

**Hari-śauri:**
[7-Up arrives] Is there ice? He was supposed to get some ice from the kitchen downstairs.

**Bali-mardana:**
It's cold.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who will open? You open it.

**Bali-mardana:**
I have just opened it. Is it cold enough?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
We call it, in India, lemonade.

**Hari-śauri:**
That was the original name, lemonade. And then all these new things, they changed all the names.

**Bali-mardana:**
It's good for bringing up gas.

**Prabhupāda:**
From my childhood I liked this lemonade. I think it was cost, in our childhood, three paisa.

**Hari-śauri:**
Three paisa!

**Bali-mardana:**
Now I think in India it costs one rupee.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One rupee, twenty paisa.

**Hari-śauri:**
For Limka.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Of course, you get forty paisa back for the bottle, but it's between sixty-five and eighty paisa after you get your money back. When we were travelling in Bhopal, we traveled there in the months of May and June. It was very hot. We were drinking seven bottles a day. Every hour. Every hour.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Lemonade.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Gargamuni and I, we had to stop. We'd call it Limka. In India it is called Limka.

**Bali-mardana:**
When Westerners go to India, it is so hot the water just comes out, you know, sweat, all the time. Become dehydrated.

**Hari-śauri:**
Apart from that, you can't drink the water in India, so you have to drink Limka or something. It's safer to drink the lemonade...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
...than it is to drink the water. [end]
