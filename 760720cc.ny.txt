Translation: "Originally, Kṛṣṇa's energy is spiritual, and the energy known as the living entity is also spiritual. However, there is another energy, called illusion, which consists of fruitive activity. That is the Lord's third potency."

//Viṣṇu-śakti,// Bhagavān, the Supreme Absolute Truth, Viṣṇu, all-pervading Personality of Godhead. So His potency... His potency must be also spiritual. Just like the sun globe is reservoir of heat and light. Everyone will know. So His potency... The sun globe potency, sunshine, is also heat and light. It is not different from the sun. //Śakti// means potency. //Śakti śaktimat abheda.// The potency of a certain person is nondifferent; there is no difference in quality. The same example: the sun and the sunshine. Sunshine is the potency of the sun, but the quality of the sun and the quality of the sunshine is the same---heat and light. So //viṣṇu-śakti,// there are... According to the Vedic information, He has got many multifarious potencies. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. Different types of //śakti.// We can see different types of agency, er, what is called, energy is working within this creation. Take for example the leaves of the tree. Some of them are green; some of them are red; some of them are yellow; some of them are mixed. Similarly fruits---different tastes; flowers---different flavor. Varieties. But wherefrom it is coming? The sunshine. The sunshine is the same, but it is acting in different way, so we see different manifestation. This is crude material example. Similarly, if we take the spiritual original, then the original is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. It is not different from Kṛṣṇa. //Ahaṁ sarvasya.// All these colored manifestation, it is coming from Kṛṣṇa. //Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:// "Everything is coming from Me." So this understanding is real Kṛṣṇa consciousness, when you understand that there is one only. //Eka brahma dvitīya nāsti.// And Kṛṣṇa is above Brahman. We have got a slight idea of Brahman, generally, but Kṛṣṇa is Paraṁbrahman. There are many millions of Brahmans, and above them, the Supreme Brahman is Kṛṣṇa. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. Arjuna admitted.

So //kṛṣṇa-śakti...// Everything is Kṛṣṇa's //śakti,// potency. There is no doubt about it. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate iti matvā// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. Vasudeva is everything. That is Kṛṣṇa. But He's working in so many ways. So many ways. How it is working? That is stated in the //Vedas: svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. He has got so unlimited potency that things are being done as if naturally, without any endeavor. But the background is Kṛṣṇa. Just like we see one flower growing, very small flower. The stem is very fine, and the flower is decorated even in their different colors. But it is not ordinary thing. If you are a painter, if you paint such a flower, it will take so many days. But it is coming. But don't think simply that it has come automatically. No. There is no such thing as automatically. Same as you, when you paint a flower you have to employ so much energy, so Kṛṣṇa has also do that, the same energy. But it is because it is so natural for Kṛṣṇa, //svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.// Simply by His willing, it is happening.

So He hasn't got to endeavor for it. That is the difference between Kṛṣṇa's activities and our activity, although we have got the tendency at least. Because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we have got the same quality. //Kṣetrajñākhyā tathā parā// [[books:cc:madhya:8:153|[Cc. Madhya 8.153]]]. //Kṣetrajña// means living entities. They are also of the same potency. So then what is the difference? The difference is that the //kṣetrajña,// the living entities, are prone to become under illusion. That is the difference. We are small, very small; therefore we are prone to be extinguished. Just like the fire and the fire spark. The spark, when it is out of the fire, it is extinguished---no more fiery quality. But so long it is playing with the fire, you'll find the nice brilliant sparks coming, now dancing. The quality is the same. Fire can burn, and the small spark, it falls down, it will burn your cloth. It is very small, but it will... It has become off[?], illusion. This is //avidyā.// The same spark, when he's out of Kṛṣṇa's touch, it is extinguished, //avidyā.// Immediately he is covered by darkness, extinguished, his spiritual quality. Not finished---at least stopped for the time. Spiritual quality cannot be finished, because it is spiritual. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. The spiritual quality cannot be finished. It goes on. And on account of //avidyā,// ignorance, it goes through another body, another body, transmigration of the soul. And unless he is again revived to his original consciousness, he has to go through that. He has to struggle for existence. He's trying to get his original position like Kṛṣṇa's brilliant position, like the fire.

So this is called struggle for existence. //Avidyā-karma-samjñānyā.// They are trying to be happy. You'll find in the New York City, they are simply struggling. What is the aim? The aim is how to become happy. Somebody is drinking, somebody is gambling, somebody is going to the restaurant, somebody is going to the Times Square, and somebody is going here, there. Their real aim is how to become happy. But because in //avidyā,// ignorance, they are unable to become happy. That is the position. //Avidyā-karma-samjñānyā tṛtīyā śaktir// [[books:cc:madhya:6:154|[Cc. Madhya 6.154]]]. This //avidyā// is illusion, illusion. Just like we are now enwrapped, covered with this body, and I am thinking I am this body. This is //avidyā.// I am not this body. So again he has to brought to this knowledge, that "You are not this body. Because you wanted to dominate over the material nature, therefore you have got this material body. Because you wanted to eat stool, you have got this hog's body. Because you wanted this, jump over unnecessarily, creating trouble, you have become monkey. Because you wanted to drink fresh blood, you have got the body of a tiger." This is called //avidyā.// He's not either tiger nor pig nor monkey nor this so-called human being, nor American, nor Indian. He's spirit soul. That knowledge one has to come. From that //avidyā,// from ignorance, one has to come to the knowledge. Then his life will be successful.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to bring back the human society, because it is not possible to bring back the monkeys and cats and dogs to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is not possible. So those who are of the dog's mentality, cat's mentality, monkey mentality, it is difficult for them. They have to change their mentality by //sat-saṅga.// This is called //sat-saṅga.// Just like you are hearing from the //śāstra,// and we are speaking from the //śāstra.// This is called //sat-saṅga. Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]. By //sat-saṅga,// by real spiritual association, by talking with them, by mixing with them---//satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido//---then we can learn about the unlimited potencies of Kṛṣṇa. //Mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ.// Then it becomes very pleasing to the heart and to the ear, by //satāṁ-prasaṅgān.// Otherwise it is not possible. If you go to a professional reciter, it will enter in this ear and go out this ear, that's all. Because there is no life; it is business. So you cannot do business with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is not agreeable to this proposal. He's master. You cannot utilize Him for your service. You must engage yourself to His service. That is wanted. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Then if we be in that attitude, that "Kṛṣṇa is my master; I must serve Kṛṣṇa. I shall not take Kṛṣṇa an instrument to become my servant..." That is not possible, although it is said that //catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna:// "Four kinds of men," //sukṛtina,// "whose background is pious, they come to Kṛṣṇa." One who is impious, he cannot come.

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuraṁ bhāvam...
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

Why a few selected persons come here? Because it requires background of pious activities. Otherwise it is not possible. We do not expect that cent percent of people will become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is not possible. But if there is one ideal Kṛṣṇa conscious person, he can do benefit to many thousands. //Ekaś candras tamo hanti na ca taraḥ sahasrasaḥ.// If there is one moon in the sky, he can illuminate the whole universe, //na ca taraḥ sahasrasaḥ,// not these twinkling stars. It is not possible.

So people are suffering. //Avidyā-karma-samjñānyā.// Being enwrapped by //avidyā,// illusion, they are struggling for existence. So Kṛṣṇa personally comes Himself to deliver them. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. That is His two businesses. So the Kṛṣṇa conscious, Kṛṣṇa's devotee, also take up the business of Kṛṣṇa by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and it will do good to him and as well as to the persons amongst whom he will preach. But //preach.// Don't manufacture preaching. Preach as it is in the //śāstra.// That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction: //yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. You do not become a rascal //guru// yourself by manufacturing some imagination, "You do this. Give me some money and you become God, you become this, you become..." This rascaldom don't do. One thing do. What is that? What is said by Kṛṣṇa, you say. That's all. What is the difficulty? What Kṛṣṇa has said, you say. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. These four things, that you just become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa... How can I become devotee? Come to the temple, offer little obeisances, take //prasādam.// So what is the difficulty? If you say there is no difficulty... And if one comes, there is no difficulty. But they are so rascals, they will not come. We are giving so much facilities that "Come here, live in this nice building and hear about Kṛṣṇa. Take //prasādam,// chant and dance, very happy life." But they'll become hog. They'll be preparing their life for that purpose. They'll become a dog next life. They prepare like that.

So therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the topmost welfare activities in the world. People should try to understand it and join it and take advantage of it.

Thank you very much.
