**Rāmeśvara:**
And I've been told that all the TV stations showed our Ratha-yātrā. That means millions of people saw the //ratha// cart. And everyone has seen it in the newspapers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rāmeśvara:**
That //Newsday// also had coverage. We didn't get that paper for Prabhupāda, but they also... This is even before their article, interview.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh. What about //Newsweek// and...?

**Rāmeśvara:**
When those interviews that those reporters took are published, we'll send them to you immediately. [aside:] //Newsday,// Associated Press and //Newsweek.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...higher[?] to temple.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Not exactly. We'll go, probably, over the Fifty-ninth Street bridge, right?

**Ādi-keśava:**
I think it would be better now to go through the tunnel.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Tunnel?

**Ādi-keśava:**
Little easier ride.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We're going over the tunnel, into the tunnel. What street is that? Fifty...?

**Ādi-keśava:**
About Thirtieth Street.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You think that's faster?

**Ādi-keśava:**
Yes, it goes right under... [indistinct discussion about route] [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
...people of New York are appreciating, Prabhupāda, how you came here alone, and now you have a big building with many followers. Actually the people are aware, very much aware of how you started this movement in New York.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And were struggling personally. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...life there is struggle. Without struggling there is no...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We should not be..., try to avoid struggle.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Because we have got preaching point of view. Preaching means struggling. If it was simply //bhajana,// you can sit down and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa like Haridāsa Ṭhākura. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"There's one credit that I have. I was never a lazy fellow."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, throughout my life. [end]
