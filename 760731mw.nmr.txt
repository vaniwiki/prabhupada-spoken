**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Viśvambhara:**
...they produce a type of nut [chestnut].

**Prabhupāda:**
Who eats that?

**Viśvambhara:**
We can eat. We roast in the oven. It is very good, offer it to the Deities.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] ...a small potato, in the //śukta// you gave it?

**Harikeśa:**
No, that was radish.

**Viśvambhara:**
See from the garden many tomatoes and squash. Cauliflower is coming also. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...a large stock of water.

**Viśvambhara:**
Yes. There is lots of water underground, but it requires great equipment to bring it up in order to water all the land.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the difficulty?

**Viśvambhara:**
We have only the previous pump, which was here before, and it's not strong enough to water everything. So we need to install a new pump to get more water.

**Prabhupāda:**
This land ours?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. Where that hump is on the brown field, up to that, where that tree is. But most of our land extends this way.

**Bhagavān:**
Our land is mostly here.

**Viśvambhara:**
We have just taken barley from this field, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Many grains.

**Viśvambhara:**
This is some, some buckwheat barley.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...castle?

**Viśvambhara:**
This is what they call a water castle. The water goes up and there's a big reservoir, and then by pressure it distributes to the houses.

**Prabhupāda:**
So it is not being used?

**Viśvambhara:**
Oh, yes. [break] ...where we grow most of the flowers for the Deities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that greenhouse. That's a greenhouse?

**Bhagavān:**
We have built that this year. [//japa//] [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
How many cows?

**Viśvambhara:**
We have three milking cows and four that will be milking. We're experimenting with different types of cows, the Brown Swiss. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. [break] ...You have got?

**Haribolānanda:**
One.

**Prabhupāda:**
What does it do?

**Haribolānanda:**
Pulling the loads, heavy loads. [break]

**Bhagavān:**
//...prabhus,// it's too narrow here right now. Prabhupāda will be going in... [break]

**Viśvambhara:**
Yes, the trees also is our forest.

**Hari-śauri:**
These are nice paths for walking, very open.

**Bhagavān:**
This way we have to go.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why they congesting the city, hellish. Such life. [break] ...very nicely, people may see [indistinct]. [devotees and children are accompanying on the walk] Thank you. All right. [laughter]

**Devotee:**
What did he do?

**Hari-śauri:**
He was going to give him a flower, and then just as Prabhupāda reached out he took it back.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...to capture him. [cow bells] He's very young?

**Viśvambhara:**
Yes. One year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bull.

**Viśvambhara:**
Cow. [break]

**Bhagavān:**
...this here, and the vegetable garden is up here. [devotees chanting //japa//]

**Haribolānanda:**
This is //mung ḍāl,// Śrīla Prabhupāda, //mung ḍāl.// And these are marigold flowers. We put them in the greenhouse because it gives a longer season. Then we'll have more flowers for the garlands for the Deities.

**Bhagavān:**
These are all table grapes.

**Viśvambhara:**
They are melons, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You can see here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Hari-śauri:**
What are they?

**Viśvambhara:**
Melons.

**Hari-śauri:**
There are melons also, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Haribolānanda:**
Here are flowers. This is a heater for the winter to keep the temperature up. We try to grow tomatoes for the Deities in the winter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
