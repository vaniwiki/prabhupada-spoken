**Prabhupāda:**
Spectacles. Spectacles.

**Pradyumna:**
//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Canto 3, Chapter 22 text 21.

//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting, etc.]

Translation: "Śrī Maitreya said: O great warrior Vidura, the sage Kardama said this much only and then became silent, thinking of his worshipable Lord Viṣṇu, who has a lotus on His navel. As he silently smiled, his face captured the mind of Devahūti, who began to meditate upon the great sage."

**Prabhupāda:**
Purport?

**Pradyumna:**
"It appears that Kardama Muni was fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness because as soon as he became silent, he at once began to think of Lord Viṣṇu. That is the way of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Pure devotees are so absorbed in thought of Kṛṣṇa that they have no other engagement; although they may seem to think or act otherwise, they are always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. The smile of such a Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so attractive that simply by smiling he wins so many admirers, disciples and followers." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. There is one instance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, how the devotee does not lose a single moment without thinking of Kṛṣṇa. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. //Kīrtaniyaḥ sadā hariḥ// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]. This instruction we get. So, //sadā tad bhāva-bhāvitaḥ// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]]. If you practice like that, then there is chance of being transferred to Kṛṣṇa just after leaving this body. So somehow or other you should be absorbed in the thought of Kṛṣṇa. We get all these examples from authorities. Just like Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, he was emperor, very responsible man. But //sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor:// he kept his mind always on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. So although great emperor, so responsibility, still it was possible for him to keep his mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. In South India there is a class of professional dancer. They take a big jug on the head and without any..., what is called? //Bira?//

**Dayanānda:**
Cloth, cap, ring.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, ring. It is kept as it is. The head is shaved, but they are so practiced to keep the balance that the pot does not fall down. It remains exactly. This is an art---they will dance, and the pot on the head will never fall down, keeping the balance. So by practice it is possible. There are many professional vendors, they keep their basket on the head, and taking a child, going and canvassing, "We have got this fruit." It never falls down. They are keeping the balance. So this is a crude example that everything can be done by practice. One may be very responsible officer, like Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, the emperor. It is not joke. But still, his mind is absorbed in the thought of Kṛṣṇa. //Sai vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor.// There is another example Rūpa Gosvāmī gives, that a woman who has got an extra lover besides the husband, so she's always thinking of that lover although she's busy with household affairs. //Para vyasaninanina//[?]. That means if you want somebody very seriously, you can think of him always, twenty-four hours, in spite of your being engaged in so many duties. It is possible.

So we have to practice this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Here, in this material world, we have to work. Without work, you cannot maintain even your family, your body. That is not possible. //Śarīra-yātrāpi te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ// [[books:bg:3:8|[Bg. 3.8]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, Arjuna, that without //karma// you cannot maintain even your body. So you have to work. //Śarīra-yātrāpi te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ.// And this material world means you have to maintain by working. And spiritual world means //na tasya kāryam kāranam ca vidyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]. There is nothing to work, as Kṛṣṇa has nothing to work. He is simply enjoying. What is called? The children have got... What is called?

**Devotee:**
Swing?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, swing, swing. So Kṛṣṇa is enjoying, and Kṛṣṇa's associates are enjoying. They have nothing to work. That is spiritual world. //Cintāmaṇi prakara sadmasu kalpa vṛkṣa// [Bs. 5.29]: that is a different world. There is no material body; therefore there is no need of the material body. That is a different world. But in this material world we have to work. //Tṛtīyā-karma-samjñaṇya avidyā-karma-samjñānya tṛtīyā śaktir iṣyate// [[books:cc:madhya:6:154|[Cc. Madhya 6.154]]]. This material world means you have to work and adjust things for your maintenance. That you cannot escape. But still, we have to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

So things are to be adjusted as it is prescribed by great authorities. In //Bhakti-rasāmṛta// you'll find the regulative principles. That is called //Vaiṣṇava-smṛti.// So here we cannot live without working, and still we have to become always Kṛṣṇa conscious. This art, to understand and to practice, is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Then in spite of my being engaged in so many so-called material things... Because a devotee has nothing to do with material things. Even if he works for maintenance of the body, that is not material. Just like Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, who was magistrate. But it is not for a magistrate to write so many books---//siddhānta-pūrṇam.// So he was in a different, transcendental platform. So that is possible, the mind being absorbed in Kṛṣṇa's thought, //satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]], //tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca// [[books:bg:10:9|[Bg. 10.9]]]. That is possible by practice. Here Kardama Muni is a living example. And there are many other examples, that we can remain fully Kṛṣṇa conscious in spite of being engaged in so-called material activities. That is possible.

Thank you very much.
