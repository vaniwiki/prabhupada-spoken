====== Visit to Proposed Restaurant and Room Conversation ======

[visit to house/restaurant which Ātreya Ṛṣi was purchasing]

**Prabhupāda:**
You are not going to install Deity?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Not here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, not here.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
The Deity will be installed in the other place...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, this is only for restaurant.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
...which is, the company is buying. There is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, then it is all right.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
And the restaurant will be just downstairs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
//Brahmacārī// will be upstairs. Householders live in the other place, and the Deity will be there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then it is all right. Very good restuarant. But people in this land, they will come for a restaurant, customer?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes, this is very good neighborhood.

**Prabhupāda:**
As soon as they understand, they will come.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
For restaurant, it is very nice. Then take it. [some conversing as lady shows them around] Very nice. Yes.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
...this is much bigger than the restaurant I saw in [indistinct]. For a restaurant they could serve 300 people, just this area, just this big. I mean not at one time. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Downstairs for restaurant is very nice. What do you think, downstairs?

**Nava-yauvana:**
It’s got a nice kitchen, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Nava-yauvana:**
It’s a good-size kitchen, all tiled.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
That kitchens can be extended.

**Nava-yauvana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you.

**Nava-yauvana:**
And an adjoining room for storage and cutting.

**Iranian lady:**
Tea?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
No. We don’t drink. Would you like one of these peaches, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
These?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes, that’s right, that’s right.

**Nava-yauvana:**
Maybe he likes orange?

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Would you prefer an orange? Can I skin this?

**Hari-śauri:**
You can cut an orange.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Yes.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Orange?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Cut into pieces, and give me one.

**Pradyumna:**
Sometimes there are amoebas on the outside. [background discussion among devotees about peeling orange]

**Nava-yauvana:**
Location is very essential.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Nava-yauvana:**
In the city it is very essential.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Iranian lady:**
Thank you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Good cucumber.

**Devotee:**
Hmm.

[conversation in Farsi/French in background]

**Hari-śauri:**
Would you like some, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

[much background conversation]

**Nava-yauvana:**
This is very expensive.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Nava-yauvana:**
This house is very expensive. Very small, and very expensive, because of artificial inflation, real estate speculation.

**Hari-śauri:**
The cucumber is very sweet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Hari-śauri:**
The cucumber is very sweet.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Yes, it is very good. Serve Prabhupāda some more.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. [indistinct] [end]
