**Prabhupāda:**
...that is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. But I am not that devotee. You are devotee. It is a fact. Kṛṣṇa supplies everything to the devotee's comfort.

**Dayānanda:**
Left or right? 

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Right. Yes. Go down Jayapattim[?]. [break] Prabhupāda, in Vaiṣṇava temples, //āśramas,// do spiritual masters ever use the stick to rascal disciples?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. [laughs]

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
It is not customary at all?

**Prabhupāda:**
It is used for my personal friend.

**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
But it would be nice, Śrīla Prabhupāda, once in a while...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. There was devotee, Nityānanda's contemporary, he used to whip. And his whipping means as soon as he whips, the man becomes a devotee. [break] [end]
