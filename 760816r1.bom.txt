**Prabhupāda:**
//Vairāgya// is there.

**Dr. Patel:**
Sir, shall I say, //vairāgyaṁ jñeyam// [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. This is //vairāgya.// So unless he has attained this stage, //virakti,// then where is //bhakti? Bhakti// is so powerful that it brings automatically //vairāgya.// But if there is no //vairāgya,// where is //bhakti?// Understand it now? Yes. It does not depend that you have to practice //vairāgya// separately. But if you are actually //bhakta,// then //vairāgya// is there. If there is no //vairāgya,// there is no //bhakti;// it is //sahajiyā-bhāva.//

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
In other words, //vairāgya// is a by-product of //bhakti.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is stated,

> kecit kevalayā bhaktyā
> vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ
> aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena
> nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ
> [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]

//Vairāgya// is to be practiced, but //bhakti// is so strong, //kecit kevalayā bhaktyā,// simply by //bhakti, vāsudeva-parāyaṇa. Vairāgya// immediately comes. //Aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.// If actually one is pure //bhakta,// then everything material, finished. That is real //bhakta.// Now I have got some //bhakti// and some material desire also, that is not //bhakti.// That is //markaṭa-vairāgya.// That does not mean that I shall stop //bhakti.// No. You take //bhakti// to the principle, to the regulative principle, then automatically //vairāgya// will come. The //vairāgya// is not coming, that means you have not been a pure //bhakta.// That is adulteration. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. That is //bhakti.// And because there is not //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]], it is adulterated.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhakti-avyabhicāriṇī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Avyabhicāriṇī,// yes. //Māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena yah sevate. Avyabhicāreṇa. Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. He is above three //guṇas.// So if I am still under the modes of material nature, that means I'm not in //avyabhicāriṇī-bhakti.// This is the warning. Therefore Lord Buddha rejected //Vedas.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Because, sir, in the name of //Veda// people were misbehaving.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vedas,// when Lord Buddha wanted stop animal killing, these rascals came with //Vedas:// "//Vedas// there is sacrifice, there is animal killing." So he thought that these rascals will create botheration. By bringing //Vedas,// there is... He said, "I don't care for it." //Veda māniyā.//

> veda nā māniyā bauddha haya ta nāstika
> vedāśraya nāstikya-vāda bauddhake adhika
> [[books:cc:madhya:6:168|[Cc. Madhya 6.168]]]

Similarly, these rascals are giving evidence of Rūpa Gosvāmī's advice, that "Here is Rādhā-kuṇḍa mentioned." But whether you have followed other things.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
//Vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ, pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt. Etān vegān yo viṣa...// You are manipulated by the //udara-vegam, upastha-vegam.// But first there is test: //etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ// [//NoI// 1]. Then for him Rādhā-kuṇḍa. //Dhīras tatra na muhyati// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. He has got three dozen //sevā-dāsī,// and living in Rādhā-kuṇḍa. My Guru Mahārāja wanted to publish //Govinda-līlāmṛta.// He asked permission of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. So first of all Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, "I'll tell you some day." And when he reminded, he said, "Yes, you can print one copy. If you are so much anxious to print it, print one copy. You'll read and you will see that you have printed. Not for distribution." So we are printing all these books for understanding properly. Not that "Here is Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Let us go." Jump over like monkey. "Here is //rāsa-līlā.// Immediately..."

**Acyutānanda:**
Even in //Kṛṣṇa// book, //rāsa-līlā// should not be told in public.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, why? //Kṛṣṇa// book must be there. In the book must be there.

**Acyutānanda:**
But in public...

**Prabhupāda:**
But you should go gradually. You should go gradually. You first of all understand Kṛṣṇa, then //kṛṣṇa-līlā.// If you have not understood Kṛṣṇa, then you'll think Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā// is just like we mix with young women. And that becomes as polluted. Because they do not understand Kṛṣṇa. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānām// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. Kṛṣṇa understanding so easy? If you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, how can you go to the Kṛṣṇa's confidential activities?

**Acyutānanda:**
Some of the devotees, they said that it is for liberated souls. So they said, "Well, we are all liberated."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Liberated for going to hell.

**Devotee:**
In your //Kṛṣṇa// book, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you've given such clear explanations along with the stories of Kṛṣṇa that it's very difficult to misinterpret them, because you use such clear explanation.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you read all the books first of all. Then you'll be able to understand.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Even theoretical understanding that Kṛṣṇa is transcendental will not help unless one...

**Prabhupāda:**
Because Kṛṣṇa is giving... [indistinct] Kṛṣṇa lifted the hill. Now how you can become equal with Kṛṣṇa?

**Devotee:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about if some devotees, I know they want to come to Vṛndāvana...

**Prabhupāda:**
Every devotee, they must follow the rules and regulations, that's all.

**Devotee:**
And engage in practical service to Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete kariyā aikya āra nā kariha mane āśā.// Has he taken order from Guru Mahārāja that "I am going to jump over Rādhā-kuṇḍa"? Why does he go? Daily singing, //guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete, āra nā kariha.// Why should he desire like that?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There are some devotees who always want to...

**Prabhupāda:**
They are not devotees. Rascals. Don't say "some devotees." Devotees will hear: //guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete kariyā aikya āra nā kariha mane.//

**Acyutānanda:**
They also wear the Rādhā-kuṇḍa //māṭi, tilaka.//

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no harm, but they should understand what is Rādhā-kuṇḍa and how to deal with Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī showed how to live in Rādhā-kuṇḍa. //Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ kālāvasānī-kṛtau.// He was circumambulating Rādhā-kuṇḍa, falling down, making a mark. That is Rādhā-kuṇḍa //vāsī. Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.// Not only counted holy names, but offering obeisances so many hundred times in [indistinct]. That is Rādhā-kuṇḍa. He, so much //vairāgya// he showed. He can take bath in the Rādhā-kuṇḍa. First of all, do this like Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. //Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ kālāvasānī-kṛtau nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau cātyanta-dīnau ca yau.//

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
In other words, first one should understand //Bhagavad-gītā,// then gradually the First Canto of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// then ultimately //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Without that, simply taking //Caitanya-caritāmṛta...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Bhagavad-gītā// is the entrance. Then //Bhāgavata// is graduate, and //Caitanya-caritāmṛta...// This is the step by step. But if one is sincere, everything becomes revealed to him. He does not commit mistake.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Some devotees, especially in Vṛndāvana, who will always try to run to Hardwar, Jagannātha Purī, always //parikramā// of holy places.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is good to go to holy places.

**Acyutānanda:**
They go independently.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Unauthorized.

**Acyutānanda:**
They go more to avoid service than to become purified.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But there's no harm if they just...

**Prabhupāda:**
[coughing] You see you can become independent, nobody can check you. Everyone is independent. //Yathecchasi tathā kuru// [[books:bg:18:63|[Bg. 18.63]]]. But one who wants to be regulated, he has to surrender. That is voluntary. Otherwise, everyone is free to do whatever he likes. And those who are surrendered souls, they will wait for the instruction of //guru// and do accordingly. That is the proper. //Guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete kariyā aikya āra nā kariha.// That is wanted. Otherwise, everyone can remain independent. All living beings are independent. Even if I say that you do not do it, you are independent, you can do it. Even Kṛṣṇa gives independence to Arjuna. //Yathecchasi tathā kuru:// "I have told you everything. Now you do whatever you like." So that depends on the candidate. Everyone is free to do anything, but if he's actually serious, then he has to do //guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete āra nā kariha.// This is...

**Acyutānanda:**
What prompts the soul to misuse his independence or improperly use?

**Prabhupāda:**
Because he has got little independence. //Yathecchasi tathā,// he has got this.

**Acyutānanda:**
Why do some misuse it and some never misuse it?

**Prabhupāda:**
That depends on him. If one is determined that "I shall only act according to the advice of my Guru Mahārāja," then he's perfect. One has to submit like Arjuna said, //śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam// [[books:bg:2:7|[Bg. 2.7]]]. Otherwise he'll argue.

**Devotee:**
Even //nitya-siddha// has //guru// in the spiritual...

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Even the liberated soul, //nitya-siddha.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Liberated soul never says that "I am liberated." As soon as he says "liberated," he's a rascal. A liberated soul will never say that "I am liberated." That is liberation. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is God---//guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsan// [[books:cc:adi:7:71|[Cc. Ādi 7.71]]]: "My Guru Mahārāja saw Me fool number one, and he has chastised Me." He's God. This is the example. If one remains always a servant ever-lastingly of //guru,// then he is liberated. And as soon as he thinks that he is liberated, he's a rascal. That is the teaching of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Guru more mūrkha dekhi'.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu is //mūrkha?// Why He's posing Himself that //mūrkha,// "I am fool number one"? That means that is liberation. You must be ready always to be chastised by //guru.// Then he's liberated. And as soon as he thinks that "I am beyond this chastisement. I am liberated," he's a rascal. Why Caitanya Mahāprabhu says //guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsan?// This is //sahajiyā-vāda.// He is thinking, "Oh I have become liberated. I don't require any direction of my //guru.// I'm liberated." Then he's rascal. Why this Gauḍīya Maṭha failed? Because they tried to become more than //guru.// He, before passing away, he gave all direction and never said that "This man should be the next //ācārya.//" But these people, just after his passing away, they began to fight, who shall be //ācārya.// That is the failure. They never thought, "Why Guru Mahārāja gave us instruction so many things, why he did not say that this man should be //ācārya?//" They wanted to create artificially somebody //ācārya,// and everything failed. They did not consider even with common sense that if Guru Mahārāja wanted to appoint somebody as //ācārya,// why did he not say? He said so many things, and this point he missed? The real point? And they insisted on it. They declared some unfit person to become //ācārya.// Then another man came, then another //ācārya,// another //ācārya.// So better remain a foolish person perpetually to be directed by Guru Mahārāja. That is perfection. And as soon as he learns the Guru Mahārāja is dead, "Now I am so advanced that I can kill my //guru// and I become." Then he's finished.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
They kept fighting, and when the real //ācārya// emerged they all became wonderstruck. They all became baffled. Now they all know in their hearts. They all know it. I can see. They all know that who is the real //ācārya.//

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The real //ācārya// emerges by his own preaching?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [devotees offer obeisances]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
