**Prabhupāda:**
...down to the Sutala planet, and by accepting the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord questioned Śukrācārya, "What was the discrepancy in the performance of //yajña// arranged by Bali Mahārāja that you cursed him?" Of course, he did not ask that "you cursed him," but it was understood. Śukrācārya admitted that there was no fault. This is the verse. When the Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped, there is no discrepancy. In the Kali-yuga it is said in the //śāstras// that //yajña// is now practically impossible; therefore it is recommended, //yajñair saṅkīrtanair prāyair yajanti hi// [SB 11.5.32].

So we are very glad that here in southern portion of India, still there are so many respectable yajñic //brāhmaṇas,// and we see practically how they have nicely performed the //yajñas.// Now this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to spread this brahminical culture.

> namo brahmaṇya-devāya
> go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca
> jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya
> govindāya namo namaḥ

//Jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya.// Kṛṣṇa wants welfare of the whole universe. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. He comes personally. So we are trying to establish this brahminical culture, //go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// You'll be very much pleased that in a country where //go-hatyā// is so prominent, now we have established so many farms in Europe and America. We shall show the pictures how we are giving protection to the cows and how we are trying to revive this brahminical culture all over the world. And they are accepting. It is not that they are rejecting. You can see the presence of so many European and American devotees here. And they are very sincere. They are not superficial. They are very sincere. Their countrymen, the priests, the Christian priests, the Jewish priests, priests, they become surprised that "These young boys, they never cared for any religion, or they never cared to come to the church or the synagogue. How they have become so much interested in understanding God as to become a devotee?"

So my request is that India, especially South India... South India is the place for all the //ācāryas.// South India is the place of Rāmānujācārya, Śaṅkarācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī. And we Gauḍīya, Mādhva-Gauḍīya //sampradāya...// Caitanya Mahāprabhu belongs to the Mādhavendra Purī //sampradāya.// Mādhavendra Purī belonged to the Madhva //sampradāya;// therefore our //sampradāya// is known as Brahmā Madhva-Gauḍīya //sampradāya.// So the purpose of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to establish this brahminical culture. //Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// It is lost, but we are trying to revive it. There is good sign. Not only good sign; there is prediction by the authorities, by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He has predicted that all over the world, //pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]: as many villages and towns are there on the surface of the globe, this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement would be spread.

So my request is that let us join together, not only in India but all over the world. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order is, //kṛṣṇa bhajanati nāhi jāti-kulādi-vicāra.// In the matter of executing devotional service to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, there is no such distinction wherefrom this man is coming, wherefrom this man is coming. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. Even they are coming from the //pāpa-yoni,// it doesn't matter if one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness---//te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.// This philosophy should be followed. I especially request the //ācāryas,// the //brāhmaṇas// of South India, to take up this cause very seriously. It is spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Please do not make any distinction between European Vaiṣṇava, American Vaiṣṇava and Indian Vaiṣṇava. That is my request. And let us combine together and spread this auspicious movement. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's desire.

> bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

Anyone who has taken birth as a human being on the land of Bhārata-varṣa... He does not mean the cats and dogs; He means the human beings, //manuṣya.// So in order to fulfill the mission of //manuṣya-janma,// we shall try to reestablish the //varṇāśrama-dharma, varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān, viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]], and spread this movement all over the world. There is no charge. Let us cooperate and do the needful.

Thank you very much.
