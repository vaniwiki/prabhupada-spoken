This is a description of Vyāsadeva. //Vidvān.// Even from literary point of view, if you see the contribution of Vyāsadeva, it is not possible in any age. So many books. Four //Vedas, Vedānta-sūtra, Upaniṣads, Purāṇas,// and the most important contribution is the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// That is his last contribution. Under the instruction of his spiritual master, Nārada Muni, he contributed //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, amalaṁ purāṇam. Amalaṁ purāṇam// means there is no material contamination. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Dharma-artha-kāma-mokṣa// ([[books:sb:4:8:41|SB 4.8.41]], [[books:cc:adi:1:90|Cc. Ādi 1.90]]), there are material contaminations. But above this is the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Therefore in the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Vyāsadeva introduces //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vāstavaṁ vastu vedyam atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam... Dharma-artha-kāma-mokṣa.// There are some contamination, cheating. But all these things are thrown away, //projjhita. Prakṛṣṭa-rūpena ujjhita.// So Śrīdhara Svāmī has given his comment on this: //atra mokṣa-vāñchā api nirastam. Mokṣa-vāñchā,// to become one with the Supreme, that is also another cheating. So Śrīdhara Svāmī has given his comment, very reliable comment.

So //dharma-artha-kāma-mokṣa.// People are busy, at least those who are human beings, //dharmeṇa hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ,// beginning with //dharma.// Economic development, //artha. Dharma-artha-kāma,// sense gratification. And at the end, //mokṣa.// Above //mokṣa// is //bhakti. Mokṣa// is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

Without being on the platform //mokṣa,// nobody can enter into the //bhakti.// It is a misconception that //bhakti// helps //mokṣa.// Somebody says; it is not the opinion of the //śāstra. Bhakti// begins when one is already liberated. //Mokṣa. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. Without Brahman, without Brahman realization, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// there cannot be jubilation, //prasannātmā.// This is the sign. What is //prasannātmā? Na śocati na kāṅkṣati.// The material disease is everyone is hankering after something which he hasn't got. And when he loses that thing, he's lamenting. These two business: //śocati kāṅkṣati.// So //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā,// when one is actually self-realized, //brahma-bhūtaḥ, na śocati na kāṅkṣati.// This is the symptom. Then //samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// Then it is possible to see equally everyone. //Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]].

So that is liberated stage. So when one has come to the liberated stage, from there he can begin //mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. //Bhakti// means the activities of the liberated stage. That is not material things. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is little difficult to understand because these activities are for the persons who have already attained //mokṣa. Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also it is stated,

> māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena ya sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

So do not misunderstand that //bhakti// is lower than something else. There are //karma, jñāna, yoga, bhakti. Bhakti// is the ultimate. So if you want to understand the Supreme Absolute Truth, take from His instruction, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. If you want to know Kṛṣṇa or the Absolute Supreme Personality of Godhead, //brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]... The Absolute Truth is realized from three angles of vision: impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā, and ultimately Bhagavān. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.// So if you want to understand Bhagavān, Brahman realization is possible. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padam// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. This //paraṁ padam,// Brahman realization. And Paramātmā realization: //dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. But if you want to realize the last phase of the Absolute Truth it requires //bhakti. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]].

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

This is the word used by Kṛṣṇa personally. Nobody understands Him, //tattvataḥ,// what He is actually. We understand superficially, "Kṛṣṇa was born in Mathurā, and He was the son of Vasudeva, and so on, so on." But one has to understand Kṛṣṇa //tattvataḥ:// in truth. And Kṛṣṇa says, //janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti,// he immediately becomes lib... If you understand simply Kṛṣṇa, //tattvataḥ,// then immediately you become liberated. The result is //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. We are changing our body, //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. We are accepting... People do not know even this. We have talked with many big, big professors in Europe, in Moscow also, and they say, "Swāmījī, after the annihilation of this body, everything is finished." But we get instruction from the //Bhagavad-gītā, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]].

So we are missing our own culture that we do not take very much care to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. We make our wrong interpretation and spoil the whole thing. These habits should be stopped. Otherwise, our culture is almost already lost. Then this //bhāratīya// culture... It is very important culture. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that,

> bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

//Para-upakāra.// The //bhārata-bhūmi// is meant for doing good to others. //Bhārata-bhūmi// is not meant for exploiting others. This is not //bhāratīya// mission. //Para-upakāra.// So every Indian... That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Because every Indian is born Kṛṣṇa conscious; naturally he has got instinct. Don't destroy it. Don't destroy it. That is our request. You have got already. We have seen practically, whenever we hold some festival in Calcutta, Bombay and other big cities, thousands of people, twenty thousand, fifteen thousand, thirty thousand people come. They are hankering. So if we simply introduce this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, you'll very soon see that the face of India is different. //Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣāt.// We have captured so many //anartha. Anartha// means meaningless life. //Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje lokasyājānataḥ// [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]. The foolish people, they do not know it. Therefore //vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām.// The //sātvata-saṁhitā// is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

So let us combinedly preach the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā// is the preliminary study of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Bhagavad-gītā// ends, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekāṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is the end of //Bhagavad-gītā's// instruction, that "Give up all nonsense. Just take shelter under My lotus feet." If you hesitate, that "If I give up everything..." You haven't got to give up everything, but you have to understand the meaning of life. Arjuna, when he understood //Bhagavad-gītā,// he did not give up his profession as a military man. But what was the change? The change is Kṛṣṇa inquired from Arjuna: "What is now your decision? I have spoken to you everything about //jñāna// and //guhya-guhyatamam.// Now you consider upon it, and whatever you like you do." //Yathecchasi tathā kuru// [[books:bg:18:63|[Bg. 18.63]]]. So upon this, Arjuna replied //naṣṭo mohaḥ:// "My illusion is now over." //Naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtir labdhā:// "My memory is now returned." //Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]: "I shall act according to You." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Try to understand what is the purpose of //Bhagavad-gītā.// You haven't got to give up everything. You can be engaged in everything, but if you utilize everything according to the instruction of Kṛṣṇa then it will be successful. Otherwise it will be failure. So we have tested all these things, how many programs and plans we have made, and everything has failed. Why not try to take the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā,// the instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and try to utilize it for practical life? And it will be successful. There is no doubt about it.

I am speaking from my practical experience. Now these foreigners, they are neither Hindus nor Indian nor //brāhmaṇas.// How they are taking? They are not fools and rascals. They are coming from respectable family, educated. So we have got our centers in Iran also, in Tehran. I am just coming from there. We have got so many Muhammadan students, and they have also taken to it. In Africa they have taken to it. In Australia they have taken to it. All over the world. So that is the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission.

> pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma
> sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma
> [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]

This is the prediction of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. As many towns and villages are there all over the world, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will be spread.

So there is no credit for me, but it is only a teeny attempt, and humble attempt. So if one man could do, if you say, some success, so why not all of us? Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given power of attorney to all Indians. //Bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]. He's speaking to the //manuṣya,// not to the cats and dogs. So, //manuṣya-janma yāra janma sārthaka kari'.// First of all, try to understand what is the purpose of life. That is called //janma sārthaka. Janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra.// Go. Everywhere there is very good demand for Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So everyone should be prepared. Everyone should understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// Of course, it is not possible for everyone to go. Still, if one understands... That is also Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order: //āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. He says, "Every one of you become a //guru.//" "How can I become //guru?// I am not very learned scholar. I have no education." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, "No. Even though you are not very much educated or not born of a very high family, you simply //yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.// That's all. You become a //guru.//" //Kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.// Don't adulterate it, but as Kṛṣṇa says, you say. You become //guru.// This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission.

So I have tried that. I have tried to follow the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction, and I am presenting //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. There is no magic, there is no jugglery, and people are taking. If you do that, everyone will be happy, the world will be happy, and India's glory will be spread all over the world.

Thank you very much.
