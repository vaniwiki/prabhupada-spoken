====== Initiation Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[//prema-dhvani// prayers]

So this morning we are having initiation ceremony for some devotees. The initiation means beginning. The Sanskrit name is //dīkṣā. Dīkṣā, divya-jñānaṁ kṣapayati iti dīkṣā.// Initiation, beginning of spiritual life. This is the Vedic function. Every human being must be initiated in Vedic culture, to make his life fulfilled, successful, because we are born animals. Animal means one who does not know except four things: eating, sleeping, sex life and defense. These are animal life. So a dog is interested in eating, sleeping, sex life and defense, and if the man also remains in the same platform---eating, sleeping, sex life and defense---then he is no better than dog. Human beings, from this dog platform, can be raised to God platform. That is possible. And human life is meant for that purpose. Therefore in the //Vedānta-sūtra// it is said, //athāto brahma jijñāsā.// Human life is meant for inquiring about Brahman, the Absolute Truth.

So this //brahma-jijñāsā,// if one is actually interested in //brahma-jijñāsā,// then he requires a //guru. Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. If one is actually interested. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. So //guru// is required for one who is actually interested in the highest status of life. Those who are like cats and dogs, they do not require //guru.// A dog does not require. He knows very well how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex life, how to defend. That does not require any //guru.// By nature all animals know it. So the human life has got special knowledge, special advancement of consciousness. He can understand. So if he is refused or if he is kept in darkness, as it is being done by the modern civilization... Everyone is being kept on the platform of eating, sleeping, sex and defending. That's all. This is going on in the name of humanity, nationality and so on. But the business is the same. The business is the same: eating, sleeping, mating and defending, as the cats and dogs are doing, in a different way only. The dogs, they enjoy sex life on the street without any shame, and if a human being arranges for the same purpose, nice apartment, sixth-floor building and all..., but the purpose is the same. Eating is the same. No. Beyond this one has to go. Therefore the Vedic injunction is, //tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham// [MU 1.2.12].

So some of the devotees who are now eager to accept the spiritual life very seriously, and they have come to take initiation, this is the first initiation. And after some time when they are accustomed, they... Now they have to promise that they'll give up four sinful activities. Sinful activity... If you indulge in sinful activities there cannot be any spiritual advancement. That is not possible. Just like here there will be fire. If you favorably ignite the fire, it will be blazing. But if you ignite the fire and pour water at the same time, then there will be no blazing fire. Similarly, to advance in spiritual life and at the same time indulge in sinful activities will not help us. The sinful act..., the basic principles of sinful activities are mentioned in the //śāstra-striya, sūnā, dyūta, pāna. Pāna// means intoxication, including chewing //pān// and drinking tea. //Chaya pāna.// So one has to give up this //pāna.// And drinking, smoking, drinking tea, chewing //pān// should be given up. //Pāna.// This is one of the pillar of the sinful activities. And meat-eating---meat, fish, eggs---they should be given up. And gambling, //dyūta, pāna dyūta// [[books:sb:1:17:38|[SB 1.17.38]]], that should be given up. And //avaidha stri-saṅgi// should be given up.

In this way, if you become cleansed, then... Just like if we get dry wood, then the fire ignites very easily. If we get moist wood, then it takes some time. So voluntarily we should give up these sinful activities. Then spiritual advancement of life will be very quick. And those who are being first-initiated, they must chant at least sixteen rounds. //Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.// The Gosvāmīs, they showed us the way. //Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka.// So many rounds we must chant, at least. Haridas Ṭhākura was chanting three hundred thousand times. We cannot do that. That is not possible. So we have made a minimum, sixteen rounds. So those who are being initiated, they must chant at least sixteen rounds. If they can increase, it is better. But not less than that. //Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.//

So these things should be observed, and always pray to Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa, I have taken shelter of You. Kindly guide me." And He is prepared to guide. He says, "If a devotee surrenders and wants My guide..." He says,

> teṣām evānukampārtham
> aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ
> nāśayāmy ātma-bhāva-stho
> jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā
> [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]]

So Kṛṣṇa is always ready to help us provided we are eager to take His help. Then //jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā.// When Kṛṣṇa takes charge of making you enlightened in knowledge, who can be better person of knowledge, man of knowledge, or wise, than a devotee? A devotee, they say a devotee: only the foolish person who has no knowledge, he becomes a devotee. That is a wrong conception. Without full knowledge, nobody can become devotee. Because he has no scarcity of knowledge. Kṛṣṇa says, //jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā.// He gives special---//teṣām evānukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ// [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]]. "Darkness I drive away." //Ajñāna-jaṁ nāśayāmy ātma-bhāva-stho.//

So take shelter of Kṛṣṇa and avoid these four principles of sinful life and chant sixteen rounds. Then easily you become advanced in spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And as soon as you understand Kṛṣṇa, you become liberated immediately. //Janma karma ca divyaṁ me yo jānāti tattvataḥ, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]].

> īhā yasya harer dāsye
> karmaṇā manasā vācā
> nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu
> jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate
> [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.187]

Anyone who has sincere desire to serve Kṛṣṇa by his work, //karmaṇā; manasā,// by his mind; by his words... So either you engage your activities, your mind, your words in the service of Kṛṣṇa. Or out of three, at least two, at least one. Then your life is successful. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that this simple activity doesn't require..., nobody requires a very high standard education to understand Kṛṣṇa or to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Very simple thing. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Here is Kṛṣṇa Deity. You see every day and think of Him. It is very easy. As soon as you become practiced to see the Deity, the impression is within your mind. So you can think of Kṛṣṇa, //man-manā.// And because you come to the temple and always see Kṛṣṇa and His daily program, then you become a //bhakta. Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto. Mad-yājī,// you worship Kṛṣṇa. Whatever you have got, little //patram puṣpam phalam toyam// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]], just try to offer. And at last just offer respectful obeisances. Then you become perfect. You become eligible to go back home, back to Godhead. Very simple thing. It is not at all difficult, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Anyone. There is no distinction. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. Never mind one is born in low-grade family, but still he can take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya, striyo śūdrās tathā te 'pi yānti parām.// Everything is open.

So not only the devotees who are being initiated today, I request all of you, please come here daily, see the Deity. Even if you cannot offer anything... I think everyone can offer, I think, a flower can be offered, a little fruit can be offered. Even if you do not offer, just come here, see the Deity and take the impression within your mind and offer obeisances. Just see. And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Everyone, there is no restriction. So that is our request. We have opened this branch in your city. It is a very prominent place. You can come and take the advantage.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
