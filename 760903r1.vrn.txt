**Prabhupāda:**
So, everything is going nice?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, by your grace only.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We have a very beautiful garden for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm. Garden? Oh.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Guesthouse has improved very much. Now we have about twenty paying guests. And during Śrāvaṇa and Janmāṣṭamī it was completely full. Very, very encouraging.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, many of our Life Members were turned down. We met some in Delhi. They said they couldn't get in. The whole thing was full.

**Akṣayānanda:**
They were fighting to come.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, they are allowed three days free?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Only. Also book distribution has improved very much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Locally?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Here in the temple specifically. Haihaya has been concentrating. He's very good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hindi?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, Hindi magazines and what we can get.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Viśāla alone does about two, three hundred every day.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Viśāla is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is our Viśvambhara? Viśvambhara is helping nicely?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Oh, yes. Hundred percent. [break] French.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's the new French //Bhāgavatam// on the back.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. I think I have seen it.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes, that's the one we got in Paris, Bhagavān.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It looks very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Bank is going nice?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The bank.

**Akṣayānanda:**
The bank is all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with Bhagatjī] So, the //gurukula// building, how far it is? [Hindi conversation] You have got them, the keys? [devotees look through keys]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When devotees come for Gaura-Pūrṇimā... [Hindi with Bhagatjī] Māyāpur, Delhi, Vṛndāvana, Bombay. From Bombay back to Europe.

**Bhagatjī:**
[Hindi] Prabhupāda? [Hindi with Gopāla Kṛṣṇa and Prabhupāda]

**Prabhupāda:**
So let them come first of all here from Delhi.

**Bhagatjī:**
They come first here.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Thing is, the whole thing has to be completed in three weeks, because the American GBCs don't like... They think it is a very big loss financially. [Hindi] Book distribution stops completely, they are saying.

[Hindi with Bhagatjī]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Hari-śauri?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hari-śauri? Prabhupāda wants you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is that correct? Is that correct key? What is that?

**Hari-śauri:**
This one's for some of the locks on the doors.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which door?

**Hari-śauri:**
Ah, front door. I think it was one on the bedroom originally. They may have taken them off again.

**Prabhupāda:**
Find out the door.

**Bhagatjī:**
[Hindi conversation with Prabhupāda]

**Prabhupāda:**
He is //pakkā-bāṇiyā,// and here is another, more //pakkā.// [laughter] [Hindi with Bhagatjī] ...special quality, he's very tolerant.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's very cool.

**Bhagatjī:**
[Hindi conversation for some time, much laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
[to Pālikā] You have come before? Or with us?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
With you.

**Pālikā:**
In a bus. I have some fruits ready for you, if you'd like to take.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You have [indistinct] //paraṭā?// No. What you have prepared?

**Bhagatjī:**
[Hindi conversation for some time] Keep patience. I am not dishonest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dishonest or not... [Hindi] Your family is very nice.

**Bhagatjī:**
Keep patience. I am not dishonest. [Hindi conversation]

**Devotee:**
Your breakfast has come. Breakfast is here.

**Prabhupāda:**
I'll take. This man, he's not [indistinct]. //Jaya.//

**Devotees:**
//Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Come [Hindi] //Bala-hīnena labhya// [Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 3.2.4]. [Hindi]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
By your mercy, Balarāmajī is giving.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nitāiyer koruṇā habe braje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe.// These rascals, they do not know. //Nitāi, balarāma hoila nitāi.// So without the mercy of Balarāma, nobody can appreciate Vṛndāvana life. //Jaya.// [end]
