> [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]

We were discussing this verse yesterday. //Anartha.// This //anartha// means this material civilization. There is no need, and still we have accepted it. That is called //anartha,// meaningless. So there are hundreds and thousands of //anarthas,// as it is stated that //śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]. //Sahasraśaḥ// means thousands and thousands. Because we have created //anartha,// unnecessary necessities of life, therefore we have to know, we have to learn, we have to teach so many, I mean to say, unwanted. Just like there is a problem now, especially in the Western countries, unwanted population. They do not want, but it is increasing. Similarly, unwanted necessities. This is called //anartha.// Simple thing. Just like we require some food. That is essential. We cannot live without taking food. That is not possible. So Kṛṣṇa is giving very simple formula, that //annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. If there is sufficient quantity of //anna,// or eatables, then people become very nice, well-satisfied, either animal or man. If he can eat sufficiently, he's satisfied. So //annād bhavanti bhūtāni. Bhavanti// means flourishing. He becomes healthy, he becomes strong, and he can think nicely, he can work nicely. So //anna// is required. But simple method is given how //anna// is produced. That is also given, //annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.// If there is sufficient rain, then you can easily produce food grain. Just like this year, the rain is sufficient; everywhere we go it is green. Green means sufficient food for the animals. And if the field is very soft, you can till it and you can get easily, very nicely, foodstuff. Therefore //parjanya,// water, rain, is required. //Parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.// And //yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]], and by performing //yajña// there will be cloud and rain. That was the... //Yajña// is required.

In this age, Kali-yuga, it is very difficult to perform the Vedic ritualistic //yajñas.// It requires tons of //ghee// and food grains. And people have nothing to eat even. But //śāstra// has made it very easy. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. If you perform the //saṅkīrtana-yajña,// then it is as good any other //yajña. Yajña// means to satisfy the //yajña-puruṣa,// Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu. So in the Kali-yuga, simply by performing //yajñas// you can satisfy the Supreme Lord. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ.// We have seen in many places, by performing //yajña,// the //saṅkīrtana-yajña,// where it was very dry, rain has fallen. This is practical. So things are very easy. But instead of producing food grains, we are producing Goodyear tires. So how we can eat? Now when there is scarcity of foodstuff you cannot eat the Goodyear tires. But people's attention has been diverted in the industrial activities. They are given allurement, "Come here. I shall give you twenty rupees per day. You give up your agricultural activities. You come in the factory. Produce tire tube, iron stool," and so on, so on. So we are violating the orders of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says that produce food grain. But we are producing unnecessary things, and therefore you are suffering. Kṛṣṇa is giving very good advice: //annād bhavanti bhūtāni.// You produce sufficient foodgrain, all over, not only here. Another //anartha// is this nationalism. Nationalism: "This is America," "This is India," "This is Africa," "This is Australia." Why? //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. Simple thing. Everything belongs to God. //Īśāvāsya.// There will be no scarcity. I have studied very thoroughly that there are sufficient land still without any cultivation. In Africa I have seen sufficient land. But they are utilizing it for producing coffee and tea; no food grains. So these are the //anarthas. Anartha,// unnecessary. People will not die without coffee and tea. But they have made the whole world self-dependent on coffee and tea, mercantile policy. There is //anartha.//

So //anartha,// if you want happy life, peaceful life, progressive life, then you have to curtail these //anarthas. Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.// Without curtailing these //anarthas,// unwanted things, you cannot become happy. So that is recommended here. //Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt sākṣād bhaktim adhokṣaje.// As soon as you become a devotee, all //anarthas// become immediately vanquished. Just like here, these Europeans and Americans, they are accustomed to //anarthas// from the very beginning of their life. And the latest //anartha// was their intoxication, LSD. But by //bhakti-yoga,// because they have taken to //bhakti-yoga,// very easily they have given all these habits. Even government is surprised. In Europe, and especially in America, their government is spending millions of dollars to stop this LSD habit. They cannot do it. They praise our movement in this connection. And as soon as one comes to this movement, he immediately gives up. Immediately, without any hesitation. I make this first condition, that you have to give up all kinds of intoxication. Not only LSD, but even drinking tea, coffee, smoking---everything you have to give up. Chewing //pān,// everything. And they agree. We do not make any compromise, that "You can do any nonsense and still you become initiated. Give me some money." No. We don't make such compromise. You must first of all agree to give up all these sinful activities. Then I can accept you. I can initiate you. This is our process.

So compulsory, the government is trying to make compulsory, but that cannot. You cannot make a person honest simply by legislation. He must be //vimarśanam. Prāyaścittaṁ vimarśanam// [[books:sb:6:1:11|[SB 6.1.11]]]. One must be fully conscious, "Now what I am doing, it is wrong." Then //anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.// Just like a person who is a thief, he knows that "I am stealing, and if I am arrested, I'll be punished." He knows that. And he has seen that one thief is arrested. So we get two kinds of experiences. One kind of experience by hearing: "If you do this, then the result will be this." That is hearing. And one kind of experience by directly seeing. So the thief has both. He has seen that a thief has been punished, and he knows by hearing from the lawbooks or from religious books that stealing is not good. But still he commits repeatedly, again and again stealing. Why? Because he has no knowledge. Therefore knowledge is essential. That knowledge can be revived. This is //kṛṣṇa-kīrtana.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended,

> ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ
> śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam
> ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam ...
> [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]

You want //ānanda, ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. Everyone is seeking after //ānanda.// So //pūrṇānanda. Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.// This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's recommendation.

So //bhakti-yoga// means chanting. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. This is the beginning. Hear about Viṣṇu, chant about Viṣṇu. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.// No, not any other. //Śāstra// says Viṣṇu. But there are many rascals, they say you can chant any name. Why? Why the //śāstra// says //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ,// chanting and hearing about Viṣṇu, not for any other god? That is not recommended. But they make. Because they are impersonalists, they have no God, they have made "God means imagination." But God is not imagination. God---here is Kṛṣṇa. He's not imagination. He says, //aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]: "I am the origin of everyone."

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]

So because you do not know what is God, so our life is void. But here is Kṛṣṇa is personally coming, //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. What is that //glāni, dharmasya glāniḥ?// That you are very //dharmika,// so-called //dharmika,// but you have no understanding what is God---that is nonsense. That is not //dharma. Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. //Dharma// means the order of God. That if you do not know God, if you manufacture your God, "God has no head, no mouth, no nose, no nothing, no, no, no, ultimately zero..." Ultimately zero. So there are two kinds of dangerous person. One person is atheist, agnostic, and another person is Māyāvādī, impersonalist. //Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādī.// Therefore these two things are mentioned: //Māyāvādī,// "God means has no head, no leg," and //śūnyavādī,// "There is no God." So the person who says "There is no God," he's gentleman, because he does not believe. But the person who takes the shelter of //Vedas// and professes that "I am //vaidika,// I am //vedāntī,//" and refuses the form of God, he's more dangerous. It is the statement of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> veda nā māniyā bauddha haya ta' nāstika
> vedāśraya nāstikya-vāda bauddhake adhika
> [[books:cc:madhya:6:168|[Cc. Madhya 6.168]]]

The //nāstika,// the Buddhists... They are called //nāstika// according to our //śāstra,// because Lord Buddha denied the existence..., the authority of the //Vedas.//

> nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātaṁ
> sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam
> keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare
> [Daśāvatāra Stotra 9]

//Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra.// Keśava, Kṛṣṇa, has come, taking the form of Lord Buddha. We Vaiṣṇava, we worship Lord Buddha as the incarnation of Keśava, Kṛṣṇa, but we don't accept his philosophy. [break]

So there is a great history. We have mentioned many times. So these Buddhists, they say that "We do not recognize your //Vedas.//" So //veda nā māniyā bauddha haya ta' nāstika// [[books:cc:madhya:6:168|[Cc. Madhya 6.168]]]. Therefore we call them agnostic. They do not... Because why we do not accept them authority? Because if you do not accept the authority of the //Vedas,// then you become godless immediately. Because Kṛṣṇa said, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. If you do not understand Vedic knowledge, if you do not understand //Vedānta,// if you do not understand //Upaniṣad//---without understanding this Vedic knowledge, understanding of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is vague. It is no clear idea. Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said,

> śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-
> pañcarātra-vidhiṁ vinā
> aikāntikī harer bhaktir
> utpātāyaiva kalpate
> [Brs. 1.2.101]

If one is not in awareness of the conclusion of //Vedas,// conclusion of the //smṛti,// conclusion of the //Purāṇas,// and //pañcarātra-vidhi, Nārada Pañcarātra, aikāntikī harer bhaktiḥ,// without reference to this Vedic literature, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has said //utpāta,// simply disturbance. Simply disturbance. Manufacturing. They'll manufacture some ways.

There are so many //anarthas.// If we come to detail it will take long, long time. Anyway, if we want to, I mean to say, abolish all kinds of //anarthas,// unwanted things, then we must take to //bhakti-yoga.// Then everything will be clear. Everything will be clear, very clear. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ.// This //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ,// just like you are so kind enough to come here to hear about Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa consciousness---by this process. This has been recommended by Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.// You remain in your place. You don't require to become a //sannyāsī,// mendicant or //brahmacārī,// or change your place. No. When Rāmānanda Rāya quoted this verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// to Caitanya Mahāprabhu... He was discussing about the aim of life and the process of reaching the aim of life. He mentioned so many things---//karma, jñāna, yoga,// etcetera, so many things. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //eho bāhya, āge kaha āra:// "Yes, this statement is not very important. If you know still further more, you can say." So in this way, step by step... When Rāmānanda Rāya came to this conclusion, that,

> jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva
> jīvanti san-mukharitāṁ bhavadīya-vārtām
> sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir
> ye prāyaśo 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyām
> [SB 10.14.3]

This is the statement, that "Remain in your place, but hear from the authorities about Kṛṣṇa. Then everything will be clear." //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. Even if you do not understand a word, but if you hear from the realized soul about Kṛṣṇa, then, //hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi vidhunoti suhṛt satām.// Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart, //īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. If we become sincere to hear about Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa will help us. //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, dadāmi buddhi-yogam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. He'll give intelligence. This is the process. //Teṣām evānukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ nāśayāmi// [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]]. These things are there.

Therefore if we want to abolish all unwanted things of life, simply we come to the spiritual platform. Because that is our aim. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// This human life is meant for spiritual understanding, not for any other purpose. //Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovidaḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]], //śāstra// recommends. Only for spiritual understanding engage your activities. And what will be other things, about my family life, worldly life? That is said, that //tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham.// Just like you don't aspire or don't wish for distressed condition; it comes upon you. Similarly, whatever happy condition in your life is expected, that will also come. You don't require... There are many places.

So our endeavor, the human energy, should be fully engaged in understanding Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Nothing else. Other things we should minimize. //Yāvad artha-prayojanam.// Just to maintain the body and soul together you should live very nicely. You should not become weak by health; otherwise, we cannot execute. But don't eat more, don't eat unnecessary things. //Atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ. Atyāhāra,// to eat more or to collect more than is required, that is forbidden by Rūpa Gosvāmī.

> atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca
> prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ
> jana-saṅgaś ca laulyaṁ ca
> ṣaḍbhir bhaktir vinaśyati
> [NoI 2]

So //anartha-nivṛtti,// that is required because we are surrounded by so many //anarthas,// unwanted things. They are all impediments, stumbling blocks on our progressive journey to Kṛṣṇa realization. Here it is said, //anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje lokasyājānataḥ.// People do not know it. Therefore //vidvān,// Vedavyāsa, he has compiled this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sātvata-saṁhitā.// It is Vedic version, and directly to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead and become free from all contamination of the material nature. Because we are now under the contamination of material nature.

> prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni
> guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
> ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
> kartāham iti manyate
> [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]

We are thinking we are very independent, we can do any nonsense, whatever we like. Who cares for...? But that is not good, because we are not independent. We are completely under the grip of material nature. Simply as a crazy man we declare independence. That is not a very good idea. We must know what are the //anarthas// and how we shall get out of it.

Thank you very much.
