//Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām.// The //sātvata-saṁhitā,// we have already discussed yesterday morning. //Vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām// [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]. This is Vaiṣṇava. //Vidvān.// Vaiṣṇava is always //vidvān. Vid// means knowledge, and //vān// means one who has knowledge. That is called //vidvān. Vidvān.// So Vyāsadeva, he's known as Veda-vyāsa. He's the giver of Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge is not given by him. The Vedic knowledge is given by Kṛṣṇa Himself. //Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, //oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya,// He gave the knowledge to Lord Brahmā. //Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye, ādi-kavi,// the original learned person. Just like this modern nonsense theory that there was in the beginning no life. But that is nonsense. In the beginning there was Brahmā, the most learned person.

So this theory, modern scientists, that there was no human being or there was no man, they are all rascal speculation. It has no value. Here we get the knowledge that originally the Vedic knowledge was given to Lord Brahmā, and from Lord Brahmā, Nārada received the knowledge, and from Nārada Vyāsadeva received the knowledge. And from Vyāsadeva, by //paramparā// disciplic succession, we have received this knowledge. The knowledge is the same. There is no alteration. Because it is coming through the //paramparā// system there is no breakage. Just like from a very top height, if you give something, but if it is given hand to hand it does not break. But if you drop anything from very high place, it will be spoiled. Therefore it comes through the //paramparā.// Take for example one fruit, ripened fruit. This //Bhāgavatam// is accepted as the ripened fruit of the Vedic desire tree. //Nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam idam// [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]]. It is the ripened fruit of all Vedic knowledge. Because Vedic knowledge means to understand God. That is Vedic knowledge. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. That is Vedic knowledge. To understand the Supreme Lord, the original person, that is the end of Vedic knowledge. So that Vedic knowledge is presented in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// and therefore in the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// Vyāsadeva offers his respectful obeisances, //oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// Vāsudeva is the origin. //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. One who has known that //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti,// "Vāsudeva is everything," //sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.// He's not only ordinary //mahātmā,// he is //su-durlabhaḥ. Durlabhaḥ// means "very rare," and when you add this word //su,// it is "very, very difficult." //Su-durlabhaḥ.// That kind of //mahātmā...// [aside:] You sit down properly. Who is that man? You sit down properly. So //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]].

So how one can understand Vāsudeva? //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]: after many, many births. Because we are---all living entities in this material world---we are all rascals. We must know it. All rascals. //Abodha-jataḥ.// Everyone who is born in this material world, either he may be... Even Lord Brahmā, and down to the small insect, anyone who has come to this material world... Because we are not material. We are spiritual identity. //Na jāyate na mriyate vā:// never takes birth, never dies. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. This is the identification given by Lord Kṛṣṇa. But we are so foolish and rascals we never question that "My position is //na jāyate na mriyate vā.// I never take birth, never I die. Then why I am afraid of death and why I am actually undergoing birth and death? I am born, everyone knows. I come out from my mother. Therefore //jāyate.// So why I have taken birth? And again everyone knows, 'As sure as death,' //mriyate vā.// So why this discrepancy?" This is human being. The cats and dog, they cannot question these things.

So this question is called //brahma-jijñāsā,// that "I am spirit soul, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi. So 'ham.// I am the same quality as the Supreme Lord. So why I am put into this condition?" This is beginning of human life. This is the beginning of human life. And if one does not inquire this, then he is animal. Plain thing. Just like Sanātana Gosvāmī. He was minister, but he could understand that "What to speak of becoming a minister---minister can become any rascal---I am the fool number one." Therefore he came to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the first question was, //ke āmi kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya.// He was never proud, that "I am minister, I am so learned scholar. Why shall I go to Caitanya Mahāprabhu and ask Him who am I?" This is humbleness, and this is the qualification of becoming a disciple. When one becomes humble, when actually one understands that he is fool number one, he has to go to //guru// to understand the value of his life, then he is intelligent. And so long he keeps himself with the darkness, that "I know everything. Who is richer than me? Who is learned than me? Who is powerful than me? I am this, I am that," that means he is rascal. //Abodha-jataḥ. Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jataḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:5|[SB 5.5.5]]]. So long we keep ourself in this misunderstanding that "I know everything. I am very great person," then whatever he is doing, it is his defeat. //Abodha-jataḥ. Parābhavaḥ.// That is going on. The so-called leaders, they do not know what is their spiritual identification, and becoming unnecessarily proud, they are doing anything and everything. //Abodha-jataḥ.// They do not know they'll have to suffer for this ignorance. We have repeatedly said that if you keep yourself in the ignorance and if you do... Because wrong thing is done by rascals and ignorant. No intelligent man will do any wrong thing. That's a fact. Violation of the law is done, either a criminal willfully doing or a person, one who does not know the law, he commits. But you know or not know, if you have violated the law, then you have to be punished.

You are not independent.

So Vyāsadeva, he is giving us this knowledge, //vidvān. Lokasyājānataḥ.// The whole population, the total number of the, I mean to say, living entities---either he is Brahmā or a small---proportionately, they are all in ignorance. Otherwise why Brahmā required Vedic knowledge? It is said, //tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Ādi-kavaye,// Brahmā, he is //svayambhū.// He's so great that he's directly born from Nārāyaṇa, //svayambhū,// not through any material mother. Just imagine how he is great. And Brahmā is great, everyone knows. So he had to take knowledge also. Otherwise, why it is said, //tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye?// Even though he's the most learned, //ādi-kavaye,// he had to take knowledge. So you can say, "He is the first creature. There was nobody there. How he took knowledge? Who gave him knowledge?" The answer is there in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// that Vāsudeva gave him. "Where is Vāsudeva? There was nothing." No. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Vāsudeva is... Vāsudeva means who stays everywhere. //Vasati sarvatra. Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. So Vāsudeva is there. So Brahmā was, although there was nobody else except Brahmā, he was in the darkness. Still, Vāsudeva was there. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. So He gave the knowledge. //Tene brahma. Brahma// means Vedic knowledge.

So //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. Vāsudeva is everywhere, and He is ready to help us, and if we become sincere to take knowledge from Vāsudeva... Even you are in the wilderness, anywhere you are, you are with Vāsudeva. You are not alone. He is so friendly that He is living with you as your most intimate friend. That is described in the Vedic literature. Two birds are sitting in one tree. This is the tree, and two birds, //ātmā// and Paramātmā, they are sitting in the same tree. One is acting according to his whims for enjoying senses, and another is simply looking over: "When this rascal will turn his face towards Me?" This is going on. [aside, referring to microphone:] Why it is stopped? Oh. So Vāsudeva is always ready to help us, provided we want to take help from Him. And He, not only internally He is helping, externally also, He's sending His representative to teach us. And there is //śāstra,// just like this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Sādhu, śāstra, guru. Guru// is there, //śāstra// is there, saintly persons are there. You take advantage. And the Lord is there within yourself. So why don't you take? This is intelligence. If we don't take the advantage... And this is possible in the human form of life. A cat and dog cannot take advantage of the //sādhu, śāstra// and //guru.// Only the human being can accept it. Therefore here it is said, //yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām. Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyāṁ kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe.// The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sātvata-saṁhitām,// given by Vyāsadeva... Not given by Vyāsadeva. Vyāsadeva is simply delivering what he has received from his //guru, caitya-guru.// He is delivering that knowledge. Vedic knowledge he is delivering, and he has written this book. //Lokasyājānataḥ.// People are all rascals.

So the advantage we must take. What is that advantage? //Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām.// If you simply hear, that's all. Just like you are hearing. If you kindly come here and listen the instruction of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// you become perfect---simply by hearing. You haven't got to make any gymnastic or any physical labor. Simply come into the temple. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// Simply see the Deity. Naturally you will think of Deity: "Oh, how nicely the Lord is dressed." That is thinking. //Man-manāḥ.// Immediately thinking. The temple is constructed after spending so much money. Why? To give you chance of thinking. Because there is the beginning. It is not the money is wasted. Rascals are thinking that "Unnecessarily they have spent so much money." No. //Paropakāra,// giving chances to the rascal people to come here and see the Deity and think of Kṛṣṇa, this is wanted. If he simply thinks, "Oh, how Kṛṣṇa is nicely dressed," that is thinking. //Man-manāḥ.// And if you offer little obeisances, //māṁ namaskuru,// then you still make further progress. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. And if you hear about Himself, in this way you become perfect. There is no necessity of very high education, M.A., Ph.D., D.H.C. No. This simple. //Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām.// Here it is said, "Simply by hearing." //Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyāṁ kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe.// The whole idea is how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the perfection of life, how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. So if we hear this literature given by Vyāsadeva, //sātvata-saṁhitā...// //Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām// Simply by hearing. //Kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe bhaktir utpadyate.// Because we require, //man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa says directly, //bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// So how you can become //bhagavad-bhakta,// here is the process: //bhaktir utpadyate puṁsaḥ.//

Now what is the use of //bhakti?// Just see how //Bhāgavata// is compiled, how nicely---because it is transcendental literature. You can say, "What is the use of //bhakti?// Why shall I waste my time, come in the temple and hear about Kṛṣṇa?" Actually they are doing that. Nobody is coming. Such a big temple. Of course, there are many temples they are going, but in other places also people have lost interest, all interest. Either temple or church or mosque, they do not go. Therefore they are surprised. In America the Christian priests are surprised, because they are closing their churches. In London I have seen hundreds of churches are now closed. Nobody is going. If there is meeting, only the caretaker and few old ladies go. Because why they will go? That's a fact. And actually churches are being sold. It is not lying propaganda. Anyone, English boy, he'll confirm this statement. Yes. People are losing interest. So here it is said that //bhaktir utpadyate.// The //bhakti// can be awakened. It is not an artificial thing. If it was artificial thing, why the English and American boys... They had nothing to do with Kṛṣṇa. They never heard in their life about Kṛṣṇa. How... This is admitted by the Christian priest, that "These boys, they are our boys, and formerly, before this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, they never came to church, never inquired about God. Now how it is that these boys are mad after God?" They are surprised. And it is actually surprising. Why? Because the //bhakti// is there. It was not awakened by the so-called leaders and the priests. It was not awakened. Religion means to awaken that Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is religion. //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. That is religion. Religion is not formalities and ritualistic ceremonies. Religion means how to awaken the normal condition, to become lover of God. That is normal condition. Love is there, but because we have no objective, because we have no instruction where to place our love, we are loving so many things---up to the dog. Instead of God we are loving dog. Love is there.

So //bhakti// means //yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.// That means..., //bhakti// means love. Unless you have //bhakti...// Just like you are giving me so many garlands. Why you are giving me? Because you love me. Otherwise there was no necessity. There was no necessity. A third person is not coming. But because you have got some love, therefore you are worshiping your spiritual master. So //bhakti// means love. Without love there is no question of //bhakti.// So this //bhakti// has to be awakened. That is stated in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// that //nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti. Bhakti// is there. Otherwise, as I have said many times, how you have become //bhakta?// There are European, American girls here present. For //kṛṣṇa-bhakti// they have sacrificed everything. Even they do not dress attractively so that they may be attractive to other boys and their life may be spoiled. Why? For //bhakti.// For Kṛṣṇa. This is the //bhakti.// That is wanted. //Kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe bhaktir utpadyate.// This is success of life. //Kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe,// Kṛṣṇa says, and in the //śāstra// it is said, and all the sages, all the learned scholars, //ācāryas,// they accept //kṛṣṇa parama-puruṣa,// the supreme father:

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

//Ahaṁ hi sarvasya prabhavaḥ:// "I am the origin of everything." //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]], the //Vedānta-sūtra.// "Kṛṣṇa, Brahman, Para-brahman---He is the origin of everything." //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. One must know it. //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.// These things are there.

Therefore //kṛṣṇe parama.// The life, success of life, means how you can awaken your love for Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe. Parama-pūruṣe,// that is explained in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta: nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti sādhya kabhu naya// [[books:cc:madhya:22:107|[Cc. Madhya 22.107]]]. It is not artificially awakened. There is, already, //nitya-siddha.// As we are //nitya-siddha... Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. We are //nitya;// similarly //kṛṣṇa-bhakti// is also //nitya.// Kṛṣṇa consciousness is there along with the living entity; it is not an artificial thing. Just like sugar---sweetness is already there. It is the nature of sugar. It is not an artificial thing. Sugar means sweetness. Living entity means //kṛṣṇa-bhakta.// If he's not //kṛṣṇa-bhakta,// he's a rascal. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. Those who are //narādhamas,// lowest of the mankind, they do not become //kṛṣṇa-bhakta.// They become other. Therefore they are //duṣkṛtina.// Why they are not //kṛṣṇa-bhakta? Duṣkṛtina,// full of sinful activity.

So you cannot become //kṛṣṇa-bhakta// and indulge at the same time in sinful activities. Then it will be spoiled. You must be very careful. We have selected, summarized, the essence of sinful activities is illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. This is the essence. If you save yourself from these four principles, then you become sinless. And unless you become sinless, there is no question of //kṛṣṇa-bhakta.// Rest assured.

> yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

One can be strictly engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness when he's free from all sinful activity. Otherwise not possible. Of course, Kṛṣṇa is very kind. If you are engaged in //kṛṣṇa-bhakti// sincerely, if by mistake you commit some sin, that can be excused. But if you purposefully commit sinful activities, you'll never get Kṛṣṇa's approach. That is a great... //Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.// That is very great offense, that "I am a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and..." Just like the Christian people go to church, that "I am a devotee of Christ. I can do any nonsense, and on Sunday I shall go, I shall admit, 'Yes, my Lord, I have done this.' 'All right. Excused.' " Then? "Then I'll do again tomorrow." This is not wanted. That is //pāpa-buddhiḥ,// that "Somehow or other let me be atoned today, and from tomorrow I shall begin my business. And again I shall come Sunday." This is //pāpa-buddhiḥ.// Such persons are never excused. But they do not know. But by mistake or by chance, unknowingly if we commit some mistake, that is excused. //Sapada-mūlaṁ bhajatāṁ priyasya.// Because he is engaged in the service of the Lord. Not only that, one who is engaged, if you simply admit, "Sir, from today I shall be Your servant," immediately, immediately you become all..., free from all... Kṛṣṇa said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You just surrender to Me." And you do it, and immediately //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.// Immediately. But don't commit again. He can excuse immediately. //Api cet su-durācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. Not that you take advantage of it. Don't take advantage of it, and "Because I have become so-called //sādhu// I can do all nonsense and Kṛṣṇa will excuse." No. That is //nāma-aparādha.// If by mistake or by chance you do something wrong, that can be excused. That is natural. Suppose you are servant, you have committed some mistake. The master immediately does not dismiss. He warns you: "Why you have done this thing? Do not do it again." That is natural.

Similarly, //kṛṣṇa-bhakti// is there. If we carefully study, //yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām...// Study means you can say that it requires education. No. It doesn't matter. //Śrūyamāṇāyām.// Kṛṣṇa has given you the ears. Therefore Vedic knowledge is called //śruti.// You go to a proper person, //guru,// and hear from him. Therefore this word is used: //śrūyamāṇāyām.// If you hear from the right person, then //kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe bhaktir utpadyate.// Then you develop your Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And if you say, "What is the use of //bhakti?// Let me enjoy." No. It is required, if you are serious. What is that required? //Śoka-moha-bhayāpahā.// Things are going on //śoka, moha// and //bhaya. Bhaya// means fearfulness. Even a small bird, he's also fearful. [birds chirping overhead] You see this bird is sitting up. It is not coming down. Why? Sometimes it comes down when we are not there. What is that? Fearfulness. Fearfulness. It is a small bird. We have nothing to do with them. Nobody has got... But still it is fearful. So any body, any material body you accept, there will be fearfulness. And why you are fearful? There is loss and gain. So when there is loss there is //śoka,// and the //śoka...,// and fearfulness is //moha,// illusion---because I don't belong to this material world. Artificially you have accepted this body. On account of this body I am subjected to these principles: //śoka, moha, bhaya.// So as you become advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, more and more you advance, then these three things---//śoka, moha, bhaya//---will be completely eradicated. That is the gain of //bhakti-yoga.//

Thank you very much.
