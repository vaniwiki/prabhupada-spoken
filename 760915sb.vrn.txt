====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.7.18 ======

**Pradyumna:**
[chants verse]

> tam āpatantaṁ sa vilakṣya dūrāt
> kumāra-hodvigna-manā rathena
> parādravat prāṇa-parīpsur urvyāṁ
> yāvad-gamaṁ rudra-bhayād yathā kaḥ
> [[books:sb:1:7:18|[SB 1.7.18]]]

[00:32]

Translation: "Aśvatthāmā, the murderer of the princes, seeing from a great distance Arjuna coming at him with great speed, fled in his chariot, panic-stricken, just to save his life, as Brahmā fled in fear from Śiva."

**Prabhupāda:**

> tam āpatantaṁ sa vilakṣya dūrāt
> kumāra-hodvigna-manā rathena
> parādravat prāṇa-parīpsur urvyāṁ
> yāvad-gamaṁ rudra-bhayād yathā kaḥ
> [[books:sb:1:7:18|[SB 1.7.18]]]

So here is one reference that Lord Brahmā was pursued by Lord Śiva when Brahmā was running after his beautiful daughter. So similarly here, Aśvatthāmā, he knew that Arjuna is coming to kill him, so he was running very swiftly. //Āpatantaṁ sa vilakṣya dūrāt.// From distant place, when he saw that Arjuna was coming... So //dehātma-buddhi.// This is the distinction between person in bodily concept of life and person who is liberated from the bodily concept of life. So when Durvāsā Muni cursed or wanted to kill... What is the king?

**Devotee:**
Ambarīṣa Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ambarīṣa Mahārāja. So Ambarīṣa Mahārāja was a devotee. Unnecessarily he was harassed by Durvāsā Muni. But because Ambarīṣa Mahārāja was a pure devotee, advanced, he was not afraid of being killed. He was not afraid. There are many instances. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. He was attempted to be killed by his father so many times, but he was never afraid. Although he was five-years-old boy, but he was not afraid.

So that is the distinction between an advanced devotee and ordinary man. //Dhīras tatra na muhyati// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. Death means changing of the body. So there is nothing to be very much afraid of, but one is afraid of death because at the time of death the tribulation, the miserable condition of the body, is very, very severe---so much severe that one cannot remain. He has to give up this body. Just like sometimes out of disappointment, too much suffering, one commits suicide---death. So death means very, very painful, as much as birth is also very, very painful.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa presents, //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyadhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. One who is intelligent enough, he should always keep before him the sufferings of birth, death, old age and disease in front. [aside:] You can..., side. Birth, death, old age and..., they are very suffering condition, but if one is advanced devotee, he's not afraid of. //Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati// [[books:sb:6:17:28|[SB 6.17.28]]]. //Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ,// he's never afraid of. Death is coming, that's all right. What is the wrong there, provided he knows that "After giving up this body, I am going to Kṛṣṇa"? //Dhīras tatra na muhyati.// He's //dhīra.// One who is //dhīra,// he's not afraid of.

So we have to become //dhīra.// Then we shall not be afraid of death. Unless we are //dhīra...// There are two classes of men: //dhīra// and //adhīra. Dhīra// means one who is not disturbed even though there is cause of disturbances. One may not be disturbed when there is no cause of disturbances. Just like we are not, now, at the present moment, we are not afraid of death. But as soon as we find there is earthquake, and we are afraid of this building may fall down, the cause of disturbances, then we become very much disturbed---sometimes screaming. So one who is not disturbed, even there is cause of disturbance, he is called //dhīra. Dhīras tatra na muhyati.// This is the statement of //Bhagavad-gītā.// We have to become //dhīra// from //adhīra.// But this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so nice that //adhīra// can be //dhīra.// This is the profit of this movement. //Kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī dhīrādhīra. Kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau.// This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is pleasing to both the classes of men, namely the //dhīra// and the //adhīra.// It is so nice. //Dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau pūjitau.// This was introduced by Caitanya Mahāprabhu and followed by the six Gosvāmīs. //Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.//

So this is the movement how to make an //adhīra dhīra.// Everyone is //adhīra.// Who is not afraid of death? Who is not afraid of...? Of course, they are too much agnostic, they forget. But there is suffering. We can see how one suffering at the time of death. There are some men dying... Nowadays it has become a very common..., coma. One is lying in the bed for weeks, two weeks, crying; the life is not going, those who are very, very sinful. So there is great pain at the time of death. There is great pain at the time of birth, and there is pain when you are diseased, and there are so many pains when you're old. The body is not strong. We suffer in so many ways, especially rheumatism and indigestion. Then blood pressure, headache, so many things. Therefore one should be trained up how to become //dhīra.// These things, disturbances, make us //adhīra,// and we should be trained up to //dhīra.// That is spiritual education. One has to know it, //mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]. These sufferings, //mātrā-sparśāḥ, tan-mātra.// On account of the senses, sense perception, we suffer. And the senses are made of material nature. So one has to become above the material nature, then he can become //dhīra.// Otherwise, one has to remain //adhīra. Dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau priya-karau.//

So Aśvatthāmā became very much disturbed. //Tam āpatantaṁ sa vilakṣya dūrāt kumāra-hā. Hā,// from //hananam,// killing. So he is described here not as Aśvatthāmā; //kumāra-hā,// one who killed the five boys of Draupadī, //kumāras,// boys. Boys are called //kumāra.// Prahlāda Mahārāja has said //kaumāra. Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. So from the childhood... Because here, //kumāra-hā.// They were innocent boys, they were killed. So we do not know, whether I am a //kumāra// or I'm old man, there is no certainty of death. Any moment death can take place. Not that "I am now //kumāra,// I can play. When I shall become old man, I shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." This is not a very good policy. Prahlāda Mahārāja says, "No. Immediately." //Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha.// Therefore the children, those who are actually //dhīra,// Vaiṣṇava, they should give education to the children. What education? Not this so-called technical education or smoking education, drinking education and so many rascal education. This is not education. Education means //bhāgavata// education: to understand God. That is wanted. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// Education should be given in such a way that the student should be very, very inquisitive. Inquisitive what about? Inquisitive about Brahman, not about this body. The body is matter, and the spirit soul is Brahman. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// This is human life. One should be inquisitive to know about spiritual life, what is spirit soul. That is the first education.

But where is that education? There is no such education. Prahlāda Mahārāja teaches that immediately, from the beginning of life, as soon as one is four or five years old, he should be educated about Brahman. That is called //brahma-jijñāsā.// Beginning. That is wanted. And for him there is need of //guru.// One who is inquisitive or serious about inquiring about Brahman, he requires //guru. Guru// is not a fashion. //Guru// is necessity. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. //Tad-vijñānam. Tad-vijñānam// means spiritual education. For material education there is no need of //guru.// You keep... //Guru,// of course required, but //guru// means to inquire about spiritual subject matter. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. //Uttamam. Uttamam// means //udgata-tamaṁ yasmāt. Tamam// means darkness. This world is darkness. Everyone, we know that this material world is dark. And because it is dark there is need of the sunshine, there is need of the moonshine, there is need of electricity, there is need of fire. Because it is constitutionally dark. And the Vedic injunction is //tamasi mā:// "Don't remain in darkness." //Jyotir gama:// "Go to the light." And our //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// Kavirāja Gosvāmī, he gives what is that light:

> kṛṣṇa---sūrya-sama, māyā haya andhakāra
> yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:31|[Cc. Madhya 22.31]]]

That light is Kṛṣṇa. And anything which is not Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa is everything, but to make a general division, //māyā,// that is //andhakāra.//

So we should not remain in //māyā.// We should remain always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then our life is successful. Otherwise, we shall continue the life of darkness, //uttamam. Udgata. Tama,// darkness. You have to pass over this darkness. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām// [SB 10.14.58]. Here in the dark... Just like in the darkness if you walk, in every step there is danger. Every step there is danger. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām.// If you want to avoid this dangerous life in darkness, then you must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Kṛṣṇa//---//sūrya-sama, māyā haya andhakāra. Māyā// is //andhakāra. Yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra.// The //sūrya,// as soon as there is sunshine, the darkness automatically goes away. So if you keep Kṛṣṇa always in view in your brain, within your heart... //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. If you simply keep Kṛṣṇa within the heart... //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ// [[books:bg:9:34|[Bg. 9.34]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// Then your life is safe. Otherwise, in the darkness there is always danger in every step. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām.//

> samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ
> mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ
> bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ paraṁ padaṁ
> padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām
> [SB 10.14.58]

This is the version of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. //Samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavam. Pada-pallavam,// lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, //yaśo murāreḥ. Murāri// is Kṛṣṇa. One who has taken shelter of the lotus feet, which is compared with a boat, //plavam,// then he has nothing to fear from this material ocean of darkness. And this place, this material world, which is darkness, and where there is danger, step by step... //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām. Teṣām,// for them, it is not for them. It is for the persons who want to remain in the darkness. And one who does not want to remain in darkness, for him, //tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta// [SB 11.3.21]. He has to take shelter of the bona fide //guru.//

If you are serious about not remaining in darkness, as it is said in the //Vedas, tamasi mā jyotir gama.// If you take this instruction of //Vedas...// Vedic instruction you have to take. Otherwise you'll suffer. That is //Vedas.// Why //Veda// is there? To give you intelligence. //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said, //anādi-bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli' gela ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa karila// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]]. These rascals, //anādi-bahirmukha jīva,// bereft of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //jīva,// they do not know when they have forgotten Kṛṣṇa. //Anādi. Anādi// means even before creation. Before creation. Long, long period. So //anādi-bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli' gela ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa...// What is the meaning of these //Vedas// and //Purāṇas?// To remind us about Kṛṣṇa. So how we'll understand //Vedas// and //Purāṇas? Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta// [SB 11.3.21]. You have to go to the //guru.// Why? //Jijñāsuḥ śreya...// If you want to know the real life, then you have to go to //guru. Jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam.// Then what is the sign, what is the symptom of such //guru// where I shall get real information? That is also stated: //jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam, śābde pare ca niṣṇātam.// One who is fully aware of the transcendental science or words, //śabda, śabda-brahma... Śabda-brahma// means Vedic literature. One is completely in awareness of Vedic knowledge, //śābde pare ca niṣṇātam... Niṣṇātam// means one has taken a dip in the ocean of this Vedic literature. //Niṣṇātam.// And what is the result? //Śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam// [SB 11.3.21]. The Supreme Brahman... Brahman, Paramātmā, Bhagavān. //Brahmaṇi,// either of them. But Bhagavān is the best. Or, if you cannot approach Bhagavān, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Brahman is also. Because if one is in Brahman, he has a chance to make further progress.

But in Kali-yuga it is very difficult to go very slow. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu and all the //śāstras,// they are giving directly in touch with Kṛṣṇa. Step by step, it is very difficult. So that is the special gift in this age. That is said in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// that in this age there is a special gift. What is that special gift? //Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya. Kalau...// In this age this world is full of faults, but there is one facility: //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet// [SB 12.3.51]. One can become liberated and go back to home, back to Godhead. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is there to take //kṛṣṇa-kīrtana// very easily. We have got report from Europe, in Yugoslovikia people are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// even there, in Yugoslovikia. That is a Communist country, is it not? What is that place?

**Harikeśa:**
Yugoslavia

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Harikeśa:**
Yugoslavia

**Prabhupāda:**
Yugoslavia. They are taking very nice part in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// So as Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, that there is no question of language difficulty. Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is so nice that any part of the world or any part of the universe you can go and chant, and it will be appreciated. There is no need of language difficulty. So take this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// chant yourself, preach all over the world. Everyone will be happy, and there will be no more fearfulness from death. //Dhīras tatra na muhyati// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. No more death.

Thank you very much.
