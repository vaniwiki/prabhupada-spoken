Translation: Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa said: O Arjuna, you should not show mercy by releasing this relative of a //brāhmaṇa// [//brahma-bandhu//], for he has killed innocent boys... [break]"

**Prabhupāda:**

> śibirāya ninīṣantaṁ
> rajjvā baddhvā ripuṁ balāt
> prāhārjunaṁ prakupito
> bhagavān ambujekṣaṇaḥ
> [[books:sb:1:7:34|[SB 1.7.34]]]

So, //bhagavān ambujekṣaṇaḥ. Ambuja// means lotus flower. Bhagavān is described in many places as //ambujekṣa,// lotus-eyed, lotus feet, lotus navel---in so many ways---lotus palms. So //ambujekṣaṇa,// very beautiful eyes like the petals of a //padma,// lotus flower. But at the same time, //prakupita,// He's angry. He's angry, still, //ambujekṣaṇa.// Not that as the Māyāvādīs think, that "God is kind. Why He should be angry?" But here it is said, //prakupita. Pra// means "specifically." //Prakṛṣṭa-rūpeṇa kupitaḥ,// "very angry." //Prakupita.// And He was, rather, glad that this Aśvatthāmā, who happens to be the son of a //brāhmaṇa...// Still, He was angry. He asked him not to excuse this rascal. Not to excuse. It is next verse, it is said, //mainaṁ pārthārhasi trātuṁ brahma-bandhum imaṁ jahi.// He's //brahma-bandhu.// He's not a //brāhmaṇa.// He's //brahma-bandhu.// Everyone can say, "I am the son of a //brāhmaṇa.//" That is //brahma-bandhu.// Or a friend of a //brāhmaṇa.// That does not mean he is a //brāhmaṇa.// This is the idea. //Brāhmaṇa// is not the body. //Brāhmaṇa// is the quality. If the //brāhmaṇa// is body, then when a //brāhmaṇa// is dead the sons take the dead body to the cremating place and burn the body. Then if the body is //brāhmaṇa,// then the sons are committing sins by //brahma-hatyā.// No. That is not //brahma-hatyā. Brāhmaṇa// is the quality. That quality is gone. With the departure of the soul, that quality is gone. Now this body is simply a lump of matter, so there is no shame when the body is burnt into ashes.

The idea is that, as described in the //śāstra,// who is a //brāhmaṇa,// who is a //śūdra,// who is a //kṣatriya,// who is a //vaiśya...// It is all described in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So //satyaṁ śamo damas titikṣā ārjavam, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. //Karma. Guṇa// and //karma.// Here Aśvatthāmā, although he's born of a //brāhmaṇa// father, he did not possess the quality of a //brāhmaṇa,// neither the work of a //brāhmaṇa.// He degraded himself. First of all, he was engaged as a soldier to assist, to flatter Duryodhana. He wanted to please Duryodhana by killing the Pāṇḍavas. But he was such a fool, instead of killing the Pāṇḍavas, he killed the five sleeping sons of the Pāṇḍavas. How much abominable he is, just imagine. Here it is said, //suptān avadhīn niśi bālakān.// First of all, they were minor aged, and they were sleeping, and they were killed at night. Just see what kind of //brāhmaṇa// he is. A //brāhmaṇa's// business is not to kill. Even //brāhmaṇa// can kill, he doesn't require even sword or any other weapon. Simply by cursing he can kill---//brāhmaṇa// was so powerful. But still, it is not the business of a //brāhmaṇa.// When killing is required, it is done by the //kṣatriyas,// not by the //brāhmaṇas.//

Just like Viśvāmitra Muni, he was disturbed by the Tāḍakā //rākṣasī.// He was quite powerful. Even by cursing he could kill this Tāḍakā //rākṣasī// in the forest, but he did not do so. For killing the //rākṣasī// he approached Mahārāja Daśaratha. Because he is //kṣatriya,// he is the king, his business is to give protection to the disturbed citizens. Just like we apply to the magistrate, similarly the king is responsible. So he did not kill. Viśvāmitra formerly was //kṣatriya,// but since he became //brāhmaṇa...// By his endeavor in lifetime, he became a //brāhmaṇa,// a great sage, //ṛṣi.// So since he became //brāhmaṇa,// he was not interested in killing anyone. That is not //brāhmaṇa's// business. //Brāhmaṇa's// business is //śamo damas titikṣā.// Even if he is disturbed by somebody, //titikṣā,// he tolerates. //Kāma-rūpa-tapasvin.// He does not become... And when it is intolerable, he approaches the //kṣatriya.//

So in considering all angles of vision, this Aśvatthāmā was not a //brāhmaṇa.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa personally advised him, //mā enaṁ pārtha arhasi trātum:// "Don't excuse him. Kill him, this //brahma-bandhu.// He has done wrong; now he deserves to be killed." It is clearly said. So does it mean that Kṛṣṇa is advising //brahma-hatyā?// No. Kṛṣṇa cannot do that. He is the teacher, world teacher. How He can advise somebody, especially His friend Arjuna? //Bhakto 'si priyo 'si me// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]. Can you advise anything adversely to your friend? To your son? No. I must give very good advice. So Kṛṣṇa is advising Arjuna, "Don't excuse this rascal //brahma-bandhu.// Don't excuse." This is Kṛṣṇa's advice. But it does not mean that we can do anything and everything under the pretext of Kṛṣṇa's advice. No. You must be first of all a confidential friend or servant of Kṛṣṇa. You must receive direct order from Kṛṣṇa. Then you can do it. Otherwise not. Otherwise not. Under the pretext that "Kṛṣṇa said," "My spiritual master has said," "Prabhupāda has said," we manufacture something. Don't do that. Unless you are directly ordered, you cannot do at least such things as to chastise a //brahma-bandhu.// This should not be done. Here is direct order.

So //bhagavān ambujekṣaṇaḥ.// Although He's angry, although He's the Supreme Lord, Bhagavān... He's not so-called nonviolent. How nonviolent? Nonviolent or violent. Violence is also one of the qualification of God. Especially in political matters, when the //kṣatriyas// are dealing, there is always violence. Without violence, //kṣatriya// has no meaning. //Kṣat, kṣat// means injury. //Trāyate. Kṣatriya's// duty is to save the citizen from being injured by others. That is //kṣatriya.// Even an animal. Animal..., just like this Kali was trying to kill cow. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was on his tour. He saw that a black man was trying to kill a cow. So immediately he took his sword, "Who are you, rascal? You are trying to kill a cow in my kingdom?" That is //kṣatriya's// duty. //Kṣatriya's// duty is to give protection from injury for the safety of the citizens. The citizen must feel safety, that "We have got such a nice king. There is no fear of anything." It is said in the //Bhāgavatam// there was no anxiety even. The citizens should feel so much safe that "We have such a nice king that we have no danger at all: not being injured, not our property being stolen or injustice given." That is the real government---when the citizens will feel completely safe. That requires //kṣatriya.// Not these //cāmāra, bhaṅgīs// and //śūdras// voted and become the president and minister. That will not be successful. That is not possible. There must be trained-up //kṣatriyas,// then there will be good government. Trained.

They should be trained means they should be advised by the //brāhmaṇas.// Therefore four divisions required. The //brāhmaṇas// have no interest or they have no time. Even a //brāhmaṇa// is made king---it is not his business---he may do it for some time, temporarily, just like Viśvāmitra also did. But it is not his business. The //brāhmaṇa// should give advice to the ministers or the legislators. They should be all qualified //brāhmaṇas,// not paid man. Paid man has nothing to do... Even during the time of Mahārāja Candragupta, emperor, he had a //brāhmaṇa// minister, prime minister, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita. He was not taking a single farthing as salary. When once explanation was called for from Cāṇakya Paṇḍita by Candragupta, immediately he resigned, that "You cannot call any explanation. Then I resign." And he was living in a cottage, not that palatial building. He was living in a cottage. That was the system. //Brāhmaṇa// lived very humbly. He was not poor. Not that they are poor men. They were so rich that when Viśvāmitra approached Mahārāja Daśaratha, immediately he vacated his seat and welcomed, "Sir, sit down here." So respectful. This is Vedic culture. The //brāhmaṇas// would not accept any comfort, but the //kṣatriyas// would be very, very glad to give all comforts to the //brāhmaṇas.// In our //śāstra, brāhmaṇa-bhojana:// it is recommended that //brāhmaṇas// should be invited to take //prasāda.// Now they have manufactured //daridra-bhojana// or //daridra-nārāyaṇa-bhojana.// They have made //daridra-nārāyaṇa.// But that is not Vedic culture. Vedic culture is to find out qualified //brāhmaṇa,// sages, //sannyāsīs.// They would refuse, but still they'll fall down, "Please come, take some //prasādam.//" This is Vedic culture. //Brāhmaṇa's// position is very, very exalted. Now, since after the battle of Kurukṣetra, they have become //brahma-bandhus.// The example is here, //brahma-bandhu.//

So we should not become //brahma-bandhu.// We should become actually //brāhmaṇa.// And //brahma jānāti iti brāhmaṇaḥ.// One who knows Brahman, he is //brāhmaṇa.// And one who knows Para-brahman, he is Vaiṣṇava. Brahman and Para-brahman. So Kṛṣṇa is Para-brahman. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ ādyam// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. So to realize Brahman realization... That is also spiritual. That is not material. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// That is spiritual. But that is the first appreciation of the Absolute Truth. That is not complete appreciation or complete knowledge. Complete knowledge is when one understands the Para-brahman. That is complete understanding. Not simply Brahman: Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.// The Absolute Truth, //vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvam// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. //Tattvam// means Absolute Truth. What is that Absolute? //Advaya-jñānam.// One. Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. They are not different. //Advayam,// the same Absolute. But it is due to my position, angle of vision, He's realized in three different features---Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. That one //tattva-vastu,// Absolute Truth.

So to understand even Brahman, one requires to become //brāhmaṇa. Brahma jānāti iti brāhmaṇaḥ.// Brahman, understands Brahman, that is the first step. Then you have to make further progress. The example we have given many times, that we are in the sunshine. Now there is sunshine, that is also Brahman, or heat and light. But the heat and light here, ninety-three millions miles away from the sun, and the heat and light in the sun---a difference. That temperature is different. So when you go to the sun-god, that position, and to enjoy heat and light from ninety-three millions miles away, that is also difference. Although heat and light is there in the sun globe and heat and light in the sunshine, but still, sunshine is not the sun globe. Sun globe is not the sun-god. Similarly... This is a crude example. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy is //acintya-bhedābheda-tattva:// everything is God and everything is not God. //Bheda-abheda. Bheda// means not, different, and //abheda// means one. //Acintya-bhedābheda-tattva. Acintya...// For us, how we can adjust at the same time one and different? Therefore it is //acintya.// Not //cintya, cintanīya.// In our present sense it is difficult to adjust things how we are one and different with the Supreme Absolute Truth. //Acintya-bhedābheda-tattva.//

So in this way we have to understand. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12], through //paramparā// system. Just as Arjuna is in the //paramparā// system, Arjuna was being taught directly by Kṛṣṇa, so you should learn from Kṛṣṇa, er, from Arjuna. That is //paramparā// system. //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. Then you will understand. If you take the words of Arjuna, how he appreciated //Bhagavad-gītā// and how he appreciated Kṛṣṇa, then your knowledge is perfect. If you manufacture meaning and manufacture idea by your concocted poor fund of knowledge, //acintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet// [//Skanda Purāṇa//], which is beyond your sense perception... //Adhokṣaja.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa is called //adhokṣaja. Adhah-kṛtaṁ akṣajaṁ indriya-jñānaṁ yatra. Adhah-kṛta,// subdued. You cannot approach Kṛṣṇa by material sense perception. It is not possible. Therefore His name is Adhokṣaja. Still you have to offer your service to the Supreme. //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. //Adhokṣaje.// This is the idea, that unless we approach the //adhokṣaja,// Kṛṣṇa... And Kṛṣṇa... //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. Those who are trying to study Kṛṣṇa by these blunt senses, they'll never understand Kṛṣṇa. They'll never understand.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa is regretting, that "This rascal, they consider Me as human being." //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. They have been described as rascals. One who, I mean to say, estimates Kṛṣṇa from material point of view, material vision, he is //mūḍha.// Therefore he cannot surrender to Kṛṣṇa. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. Lowest of the mankind, //narādhama.// Why lowest? Sinful? //Duṣkṛtina?// These things are there. If we want to understand Kṛṣṇa, then we should take the prescription of Kṛṣṇa. What Kṛṣṇa said? //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]: "One can understand Me by the process of //bhakti.//" Never said, Kṛṣṇa, that "//Yogī// can understand Me" or "The //jñānīs// can understand Me" or "The //karmīs// can understand." Never. //Nāhaṁ tiṣṭhāmi yogināṁ hṛdayeṣu.// Although //yogīs// are trying to see Kṛṣṇa always within the heart... //Yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra-marutaḥ stunvanti, dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ...// [SB 12.13.1]. Those who are perfect //yogīs,// they see always Kṛṣṇa within the core of the heart. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// That is perfect //yogī.// That is... Kṛṣṇa admits,

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

That is first-class //yogī,// one who is thinking of Kṛṣṇa always within the core of the heart. So //yogīs, jñānīs, karmīs, bhaktas...// So when you become //bhakta,// then you are perfect //karmī,// you are perfect //yogī,// you are perfect //jñānī.// Unless you are perfect //jñānī,// how you can surrender to Kṛṣṇa? //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. After many, many births cultivating knowledge, when he's actually wise---//jñānavān.// Then what is the symptom? //Māṁ prapadyate:// he surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. Why? //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. He understands that Kṛṣṇa is everything. That is real knowledge. Otherwise, it is not knowledge; it is speculation.

So speculation will not help us. We must have perfect knowledge, and that knowledge is given by Kṛṣṇa. You take it and follow //mahājana// like Arjuna and other devotees, then you understand Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as you understand Kṛṣṇa, you are immediately liberated. Immediately.

> janma karma ca divyaṁ
> me yo jānāti tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti...
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

That is liberation. So simple thing, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Simply think of Kṛṣṇa, chant Kṛṣṇa's name, Hare Kṛṣṇa, and be honest, and liberation is guaranteed.

Thank you very much.
