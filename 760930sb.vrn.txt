**Pradyumna:** Translation: "Furthermore, I have personally heard you promise Draupadī that you would bring forth the head of the killer of her sons." [break] [leads chanting of synonyms to SB 1.7.39] [break]

[01:02]

Translation: "This man is an assassin and murderer of your own family members. Not only that, but he has also dissatisfied his master. He is but the burnt remnants of his family. Kill him immediately." [break]

So Kṛṣṇa is encouraging Arjuna to kill Aśvatthāmā on so many grounds. First of all, he has killed the boys who were sleeping at night. And another very important point is that //ātatāyī. Ātatāyī// means the enemy, aggressor. Unnecessarily one who attacks, he is called //ātatāyī.// One who sets fire in your house, one who kidnaps your wife or somebody in the family, and one who gives poison---and they are so many, a list of ascertaining an //ātatāyī.// So He described, Kṛṣṇa described the Aśvatthāmā as //ātatāyī.// He's not a brave soldier, so he should be killed. So many faults Kṛṣṇa found in his behavior. And //bhartuś ca vipriyaṁ vīra.// He could not satisfy his master also. Sometimes the servants do something abominable for pleasing the master. But he could not please even the master. He wanted to please Duryodhana, his master, promising him that he would kill all the five brothers, the Pāṇḍavas. But instead of killing the Pāṇḍavas, he killed their sons. Duryodhana did not like that, because he knew that the whole Kuru family practically was killed. Only the five brothers, and Mahārāja Parīkṣit was in the womb of his mother, they survived. So Duryodhana did not like. Duryodhana, whatever he may be, he was a //kṣatriya// and he fought bravely. So he did not like the Kuru dynasty should be finished. He did not like it. But when he understood that the five sons of Pāṇḍavas were also killed, he became very much disappointed because the Kuru dynasty is finished. So he could not satisfy his master. //Bhartuś ca vipriyam.// So whatever he had done, all abominable. Not to the rules and regulations---neither as a //brāhmaṇa// or as a //kṣatriya,// nor even a brave soldier. "He has done things like a //śūdra,// or less than a //śūdra,// without any religious principle. So he should be killed. There is no excuse. And it is for his good."

In the //śāstra// it is said that one who is a criminal, he should be killed. Therefore in every country, up to date, a murderer is killed, is hanged. That is good for him. If a murderer is killed in this life, punished by the state, government, then his sinful activities and the resultant action is also finished. He's giving his own life. Otherwise, if he escapes, in next life he'll suffer so many troubles. That is, I think, they have described in the previous verse. //Tasya hi... Tad-vadhas tasya hi śreyaḥ.// In the verse number 37 it is explained by Kṛṣṇa that to kill this person, it is for his good. Because he has done so many criminal activities, so by killing him he'll be saved from serious types of sufferings in the next life. //Śreya. Tad-vadhas tasya hi śreyo yad-doṣād yāty adhaḥ pumān// [[books:sb:1:7:37|[SB 1.7.37]]]. //Prāyaścitta.// It is called //prāyaścitta. Prāyaścitta,// in the //śāstras, prāyaścitta// is described. In every religion there is //prāyaścitta,// atonement. In Christian religion the //prāyaścitta// is also advised. The sinner has to admit that he has committed sin, then he is excused by Christ or God. But not that "Purposefully I'll go on committing sins, and then I shall admit, and I'll go on with my this business and I'll be excused." No. That is not. It is quite natural that if you have done something criminal by mistake, then you can be excused by the authorities. But not that because by your admission you were once excused, and you'll go on committing all kinds of sinful activities, and you'll be excused simply by admission. No. That is not possible. The Christians, they do like that. On Sunday they go to the church, and they admit their sinful activities of the week, and pay something fine to the priest, and they become free from the sinful activities, reactions. And from Monday, again he begins. And then again on Sunday, he admits.

There was a movement, Moral Re-armament Movement, MRA. So just like we say that by //saṅkīrtana// one is freed from all sinful reactions, this Moral Re-armament Movement also preached that by your admission you become free from all sinful reaction. But this should not be... Either //hari-nāma// or the Christian method of atonement should not be taken as profession. This is once or twice you can be excused, but not that you take it as a profession. That is great sinful. We have got also //nāma-aparādha. Daśa-vidha-nāma-aparādha//---ten kinds of offenses. If you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// with offenses, then it will not be effective. You must avoid the offenses. You know ten kinds of offenses---//guror avajñā śruti-śāstra-nindanam// [Padma Purāṇa]. There are so many offenses, and one of the offenses is //nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ// [//Padma Purāṇa, Brahma-khaṇḍa//]. He is greatest offender, one who thinks that "By chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// I become free from reaction of sinful life. So the whole day I shall go on committing all kinds of sinful activities, and at night or sometime I shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa---everything will be finished." This is the greatest sin. //Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.// He's never excused. He is condemned. Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepts a sinful man like Jagāi and Mādhāi on the condition that he does not commit any more any sinful activities. On this condition. Not that "I have become a Vaiṣṇava. I'm chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, so I can go on committing all kinds of sinful activities. There will be no reaction." This kind of conviction is the greatest offense. You should remember. Not like that, the Christian atonement.

So we should be very careful about this, //nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.// Factually, we should not take //hari-nāma// as a matter of atonement or //śubha-kriyā. Śubha-kriyā.// Just like there are many //śubha-kriyā,// auspicious activities. We should not take chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// as some auspicious activity. It is certainly auspicious, but generally people perform some auspicious activities, //śubha-kriyā,// to counteract their impious activities. This should not be done. This is also another offense. You cannot utilize //hari-nāma// for any material purposes. Material purpose is... Just like generally, people go to a //guru// for benefit of some material purpose: "Sir, I have got some cholic pain within my abdomen. Kindly give me your blessing." The materialistic person, they are after blessing for some material benefit. They are not after Kṛṣṇa. That is another offense. Therefore to go to //guru// or to accept a //guru,// there should not be any material purpose. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. One should go to a //guru// for spiritual advancement of life, not as a fashion. People go to a //guru// as a fashion. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that "Don't make a //guru// just like you keep a dog, as a fashion." Nowadays it has become a fashion to keep a dog. In the European, American countries it is a compulsory fashion to have a dog. [chuckles] Everyone keeps a dog. And they love dog very much, more than anything. [laughter]

So now we are also imitating, because India is imitator. Since the Britishers came here, we have become first-class imitator. When the 1914, the war was going on, so it is understood that in high court, Calcutta high court, there is leisure hour, tiffin hour. So all the judges were sitting. So one English judge, he asked Sir Asutosh Mukherji, "Mr. Mukherji, now the Germans are coming, and if so, what you are going to do?" Mr. Mukherji, Sir Asutosh Mukherji, he replied, "Yes, as soon as the Germans will come, we shall offer our respect in this way, 'Come on, sir.' " "So you'll not counteract? Why?" "You have taught us to make like this, so we shall do that. Because you have simply taught us this, how to obey your orders. So anyone who will come, we shall do this." The idea is the slave mentality... The Englishmen, in an organized way, they taught the Indians how to become servant of the Englishmen. We have seen. It is Gandhi's movement that he dismantled this idea of white prestige. Otherwise, we were taught like that. So this imitation of Englishmen... Formerly, in our childhood, it was the advancement of civilization if one could imitate the English fashion. That was.

So we should not make that a fashion. //Guru// is not a fashion. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in //Bhagavad-gītā,// in all Vedic literature, who requires a //guru,// that is described. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. He requires a //guru. Jijñāsuḥ. Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// That is human life. One who is interested in inquiring about Brahman, he requires a //guru.// One who has no business for understanding Brahman, simply to make a fashion that "I have a //guru,//" this is useless. It has no value. One must be very much inquisitive to understand the spiritual science. He requires a //guru. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ. Jijñāsuḥ// means inquisitive.

> catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ
> sukṛtino 'rjuna
> ārto arthārthī jijñāsur 
> jñānī ca bharatarṣabha
> [[books:bg:7:16|[Bg. 7.16]]]

//Jñānī, jijñāsur, ārtaḥ, arthārthī.// The //gṛhasthas,// they are //ārta,// distressed. So if he's pious, so in his distressed condition he approaches the Supreme Personality of Godhead, "My Lord, I am very much distressed. Kindly give me Your favor." "Give me." There is "give me." And //jijñāsuḥ, jñānī,// they do not want anything "Give me," but //jijñāsuḥ:// "Actually, what is God? What is the Absolute Truth?" That is the difference. One is going to God for asking something, and //jijñāsuḥ, jñānī,// is eulogized because they do not ask anything. To ask anything from God is not higher standard of //bhakti.// Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. This is pure devotion.

People generally go to Kṛṣṇa, God, "O God, give us our daily bread." This is not //bhakti,// but it is piety because he goes to God. Therefore //sukṛtina.// He's not the sinful man. He's pious man. At least he has approached God. And those who are sinful, they do not approach even. They do not go even in the temple to ask something. They say, "What is this nonsense? We don't require. We shall work hard." Nowadays it is going on. "Why you go to temple? Why you give credit to God for your success? You work hard..." There is a philosophy, //karma-mīmāṁsā.// It is like that. "You work hard and you get the profit. Why you should give credit to God?" This is going on. They are //duṣkṛtina.// They do not know that without God's mercy you cannot get anything. Otherwise, simply by working hard, anyone could become a big man? No. That is not possible. Without Kṛṣṇa's desire, without sanction, it cannot be done. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. Everyone is under the obligation of nature and //karma.// One cannot surpass. There are many instances in the //śāstra.//

So we are discussing the point, "Who requires a //guru?//" If you are actually serious about understanding the spiritual subject matter, //brahma-jijñāsā...// Not this market value. If you are interested about //brahma-jijñāsā...// Just like the merchant association, they inquire, "What is the value of this share? What is the value of this commodity? What is the val...?" No. Not that kind of inquiries. But //śreya-uttamam, jijñāsuḥ śreya-uttamam.// There are two kinds of objective: //śreya// and //preya. Preya// means immediately sense gratification. Just like a child. Child wants to play because it gives him immediately some sense gratification, satisfaction. He does not like to go to a school or to study or to take lesson. He does not like. That is actually //preya// [//śreya//]. //Preya...// That is //śreya,// future benefit. So the parents, the guardians, engage him for future benefit: "You must take education. Otherwise, in future you'll suffer without education." So this is called //śreya.// Similarly, our human life is meant for //śreya,// not for //preya.// The modern civilization, they are interested in //preya:// immediate some sense gratification. That is not wanted. Therefore //śāstra// said //śreya,// not //preya.// The modern civilization is that "Eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. Do not care for what is future life." That is condemned civilization. We should know that there is future life, there is birth after death, and we must be prepared. As it is advised in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtejyā yānti bhūtāni 
> yānti mad-yājino 'pi mām
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

So you can achieve this success of life, //mad-yājino 'pi yānti mam.// There are many kinds of future benefit. //Yānti deva-vratā devān.// You can be elevated to the higher planetary system. In the heavenly planets you get long duration of life, higher standard of life, that you can get. But that also is not //śreya.// That is //preya,// the same material happiness in higher standard. //Śreya// is //mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām.// If you practice //yājinaḥ,// worshiping Kṛṣṇa, as Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], //mad-yājinaḥ,// the same thing. If you practice, that is your //śreya.// Otherwise, anything you do, considering it is very nice, you are being entangled. //Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]]. If you try to advance in devotional service even a little bit, it can save you from the greatest danger. And if you do not do that, if you are entangled, if you are enamored by immediate sense satisfaction, you become //karma-bandhana.//

Therefore //guru// is required who can save you from the //karma-bandhana// process. //Karma-mukta. Karma-mukta,// that is required. Not //karma-bandhana. Karma-mukta. Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.// If you are trained up to devotional service,

> māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena yah sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān...
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

That is //sa guṇān samatītyaitān.// That is //mukti. Baddha,// conditioned, means we are under the three modes of material nature. That is conditioned. And //mukti// means you are not under the obligation of the three modes of material nature. That is //karma..., mukta.// So Kṛṣṇa can make you immediately //mukta. Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.// That is Kṛṣṇa's power. //Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// He can make the lowest class of men... //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ ye 'nye ca pāpāḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. They are considered as the most sinful, less than the //śūdras, caṇḍālas. Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā...// Or more sinful, //śudhyanti.// They can be purified by the mercy, by the power, //prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// Viṣṇu has got so much power. So that power you can have the benefit if you surrender to Viṣṇu. Therefore Kṛṣṇa personally comes and requests you,

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

So here is Kṛṣṇa's direction. You take always Kṛṣṇa's direction, then that is //bhakti,// and you remain //brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]: you are always immune from the sinful reactions of this material world. It does not mean... You cannot manufacture. Actually you have to follow the orders of Kṛṣṇa, just like Arjuna is being advised. You simply follow Kṛṣṇa. Not that whimsically he was going to punish Aśvatthāmā. Under direction of Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, in every step of your life, if you take Kṛṣṇa's direction or His representative's direction, then you are safe.

Thank you very much.
