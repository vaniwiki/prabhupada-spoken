So, in continuation of the Pāṇḍavas' position in relationship with Droṇācārya, the //guru,// so many things are being explained by Draupadī. So she is not ordinary woman. She knows everything of the religious principles, and therefore she is teaching the assembly of respectable, learned persons how the spiritual master should be respected. Droṇa is also, I mean to say, qualified as //bhagavān.// Bhagavān Droṇa. Anyone who is extraordinarily powerful, he is addressed sometimes as //bhagavān.// Nārada Muni is also sometimes addressed as //bhagavān.// Lord Śiva is also sometimes addressed as //bhagavān.// We have explained the different features of //bhagavān// many times. //Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. So the Supreme Bhagavān is Kṛṣṇa. //Nānyat parataro... Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. There may be so many //bhagavāns,// but the absolute //bhagavān// is Kṛṣṇa. //Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya.// Not //samagra,// but the Supreme Personality, He is //samagra.// The others, they have got to certain extent the qualities of //bhagavān.// In that sense they can be addressed as //bhagavān.// But they are not //samagra. Samagra// is..., //samagra// means the complete. That is only attributed to Kṛṣṇa, nobody else.

//Sa eṣa bhagavān droṇaḥ prajā-rūpeṇa vartate. Prajā// means offspring, son, daughter also. //Prajāyate:// one who is born of the father. Without father, there is no possibility, son or daughter. Therefore //prajāyate,// one who gives birth. And the //prajā... Prajā// is the product of the body of the father. A son or daughter, they may be different persons, but they belong to the body of the father. //Yathā yoni yathā bījam.// Father is the //bījam.// Just like //bījam,// the seed. The seed is the tree later on. Similarly, the //bījam,// the seed, is put by the father in the womb of the mother, and as the seed implanted in the earth and taken care of with watering, sprinkling, it grows to a big tree, similarly, the seed is sown in the womb of the mother, and the mother takes care of the seed, and it comes to a big body later on and comes out. This is the process of birth. So in one sense, between the seed and the tree there is no difference. Similarly, the seed of the father and the father, there is no difference. Here it is //prajā-rūpeṇa vartate.//

So according to Vedic culture, if one woman has got son, she is not considered to be widow. Widow means one who hasn't got husband, or husband is dead. So if the husband's representative is there, so, strictly speaking, she is not widow. So //prajā-rūpeṇa vartate.// Again the wife is considered //ardhāṅginī.// I think in English also it is said, "better half." Wife is considered half the body. The left-hand side half... Perhaps you have seen the picture that Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, one body. The left-hand side is Rādhārāṇī, right-hand side is Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has explained this, //rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktir asmād ekātmānāv api// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, They are one, but for pastimes They have become two. //Ekātmānāv api bhuvi purā deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau.// Again Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa united, //caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptam.// So these things are there. So wife is considered better half, //ardhāṅginī.// So the //ardhāṅginī// is there, and the son is there. In so many ways they are convincing that "Do not think that Droṇācārya is dead and gone." He's [She's] convincing this point. "Droṇācārya is still existing. So killing the son of Droṇācārya means killing Droṇācārya. So do not do this." He's [She's] putting so many arguments.

Then, //tad dharmajña mahā-bhāga bhavadbhir gauravaṁ kulam.// One should act in such a way that it should be glorified in the family. The family consideration is very important in Vedic culture. A family does not mean that only a husband, wife or a few children. No. Family means the generation. That is Vedic conception. So if something is wrong done by any member of the family, that becomes a scar to the whole family. So she is, from family-wise, she is warning that "Do not do anything which will be a discredit to the whole Pāṇḍava family." //Vṛjinaṁ nārhati prāptuṁ pūjyaṁ vandyam abhīkṣṇaśaḥ.// So the //guru// and the //guru's// family, they do not require to be chastised or punished. It has been misused in so many ways. In Bengal, just like they say //nityānanda-vaṁśa:// coming from Nityānanda. So Nityānanda had one son, Vīrabhadra. But Vīrabhadra did not marry. So there is no dynasty by semina. By //nityānanda-vaṁśa// means by disciplic succession. So sometimes extra advantage was taken as //nityānanda-vaṁśa.// But people have got respect for such thing, dynasty. So not only it is now; from time immemorial, //guru, guru's// dynasty... Even in Muhammadan religion there is such sentiment, Muhammad and his dynasty, Hussain, they are taken very respectfully. So considering all points, the //guru's// respect must be maintained. This is the sum and substance of the instruction.

But there is other, opposite instruction also. If the //guru// is not in his proper way according to //śāstra... Guru// means he must be abiding by the rules and regulation of the //śāstra. Sādhu-guru-śāstra. Sādhu// means one who is obeying the rules and regulation of //śāstra. Śāstra// must be the medium. Without //śāstra,// nothing is acceptable. That is spoken by Kṛṣṇa. //Tasmād śāstra-vidhānoktaḥ. Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ// [[books:bg:16:23|[Bg. 16.23]]]. So nobody can transgress the rules and regulation of //śāstra,// and what to speak of a //guru. Guru// is //ācārya. Acinoti yaḥ śāstrāṇi.// One who knows the rules and regulation of the //śāstra,// and he teaches his disciple according to the //śāstra,// he is called //ācārya.// So //ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit// [SB 11.17.27]. //Navamanyeta karhici.// So //ācārya// should be respected, as Kṛṣṇa says, as good as Kṛṣṇa. Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura also said, //sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ. Ācārya, guru,// is as good as God. //Sākṣād-dharitvena. Ācārya// should be respected as Kṛṣṇa. Therefore //ācārya upasanam nāvamanyeta karhicit.// If somebody foolishly thinks that "They are worshiping a man. He's like me, and he has taken the seat, and he's taking worship, respect, from disciples..." Sometimes they question like that. But they do not know that how //ācārya// should be respected. //Ācārya// should be respected //sākṣād-dharitvena,// just like God. It is not exaggeration; it is according to the //śāstra.// And //ācārya// also accepts all these respectful obeisances to carry to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the process. As we receive knowledge from the //ācārya,// similarly, our activities, the result of activities, is carried by the //ācārya// to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Ācārya// does not accept anything on his own account. //Ācārya// accepts everything on Kṛṣṇa's account. That is the principle. And because he is representative of Kṛṣṇa, he is dealing on behalf of Kṛṣṇa.

We have got in practical experience. Formerly, in British government, there was viceroy. //Vice// means in place of and //roy// means royal king. Viceroy. So this viceroy was respected as the king, as the emperor. That is the process. When he's no longer a viceroy, then he's not respected. But so long he is acting as viceroy... And the rule was that whatever presentation was given to the viceroy, he did not accept it personally. It was kept in the state. So these are the process. So //guru, ācārya,// being representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he //should// be worshiped. //Nāvamanyeta... Na martya-buddhyāsūyeta// [SB 11.17.27]. Never think of envying. As soon as we become envious of the //ācārya,// there is falldown, immediately. //Yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi. Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ.// This is the teaching of Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. He's also //ācārya. Ācārya-paramparā.//

So, //nāvamanyeta karhicit martya-buddhyā. Ācārya// should not be considered as ordinary human being. //Vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhir guruṣu nara-matiḥ, arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr, guruṣu nara-matiḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. These are the injunction. //Nārakī.// Everyone knows that here is //vigraha,// Gaura-Nitāi //vigraha,// Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma //vigraha,// Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //vigraha.// Everyone knows that it was..., these //vigrahas// were ordered from Jaipur, and it is now installed. But why people are coming in thousands to see the //vigraha?// They do not know that it is made of stone? Everyone knows. Maybe one or two may be coming, sentiment. In every temple... Just like Jagannātha Purī temple, everyone knows that Jagannātha is made of wood. Then why //lakhs// of people are going there to see? Similarly, Bālajī. Everyone knows He's made of stone. But thousands of people are going to see. So this is the system. This is not artificial. This is the system. One... As the //vigraha... Vigraha// means the form of the Lord. There are eight kinds of the forms of the Lord: they are made of stone, they are made of wood, they are made of jewels, and sometimes they are made of painting, and metal. So many. There are eight. All these //vigrahas// are to be worshiped. That is mentioned in the //śāstras.// Painting also. If there is painting, or even if you think of the form of the Lord within the mind, that is also //vigraha.// Just like //dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. The //yogīs,// they think of Viṣṇu form within the core of the heart. That is also //vigraha.// Don't think that is imagination. That is also //vigraha.// So there are eight kinds of //vigrahas,// and each and every one of them are as good as the other. Similarly, //vigraha// of //guru// is also... //Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.// This is the injunction of the //śāstra.// And... "May be in the //śāstra,// but it is not carried." No, it is carried. //Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktaḥ,// it is said, //tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ.// Those who are aware of the //śāstras...//

Just like we have installed the Deity according to //śāstra.// There is nothing imaginary. It is not idol worship. Idol worship is different. Just like in the Western countries they put an idol on the street, on the park, as the resting place of the crows and passing stool on the head. That is idol worship. The so-called statues are installed, and without any protection... No. Our worship is not idol worship. This is Deity worship. We construct temple and spend //lakhs// of rupees to install the Deity. It is not idol worship. Idol worship is different. Therefore it is warned, //arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīḥ.// If somebody thinks that the //vigraha// is idol worship... There are so many rascals, they think like that. They are..., "Why you are worshiping in the temple?" Amongst the Indians also, the Arya-samajis, they protest against temple worship. But who cares for them? Here in Vṛndāvana there is Arya-samaji temple. Nobody goes there. But this is a new temple, recently started, and thousands of people are coming. Why? All of them are fools and rascals?

So this is exactly according to the //śāstra.// And the argument that "God is everywhere. Why you should go to the temple?" And what is this nonsense? If God is everywhere, why not in the temple? But this is their argument, nonsense argument. God is everywhere, but not in the temple. This is their argument. So we do not care. Nobody cares. So many agitators came and gone, but the Vedic process will go on. "Let the dogs bark; the caravan will pass." There is no difficulty. So on the whole, this is Vedic civilization, that the //vigraha// of the Supreme Personality of Godhead accepted as He is present. We should take it that Kṛṣṇa... Actually, this is the fact. As you have read in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// there was the Sākṣi-gopāla history, and the two //brāhmaṇas,// they promised before the Deity, and later on there was misunderstanding, and the Deity from Vṛndāvana went to bear witness in Orissa, more than thousands of miles away. And that Sākṣi-gopāla, witness Gopāla---Sākṣī means witness---is still being worshiped in Jagannātha Purī, near. There is a station, Sākṣi-gopāla.

So as the Deity of the Lord, //vigraha,// should not be considered as made of stone, wood, similarly, //guru// also should not be accepted as ordinary human being. He should be given all respect as we give to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is being explained by even one woman. That is Vedic culture. Draupadī is explaining the importance, and she has said, //sa eṣa bhagavān droṇaḥ.// She's quite right when she's accepting Droṇa as //bhagavān. Sa eṣa bhagavān droṇaḥ prajā-rūpeṇa vartate.// And he is present by his //prajā.// These things should be taken very seriously instruction. Therefore //śrīmad-bhāgavatam amalaṁ purāṇam// [SB 12.13.18]. This is //pramāṇa. Pramāṇi-grantha. Pramāṇi-grantha// means //śabda-pramāṇa. Śabda-pramāṇa, anumāna pramāṇa// and //anumāna...// Just like a sound is going on. One who knows, that's all right. But we can---hypothesis---we can think that some machine is running on. We may not know what is that machine. So this is //anumāna.// I'm not seeing the machine, what kind of machine is running on, but I can think of, imagine, that it may be some machine is running on. That is also another //pramāṇa.// Hypothesis, inductive, deductive. They are also... Analogy. There are so many processes. So here, Kṛṣṇa and //guru,// they should be accepted on the same level. Therefore Draupadī has addressed Droṇācārya as //bhagavān. Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ.// It is accepted. We should also accept.

Thank you very much.
