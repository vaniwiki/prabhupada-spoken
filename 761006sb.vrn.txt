So, in these two verses the important point is that Draupadī is sympathetic. That is Vaiṣṇava. She is Vaiṣṇavī. This is the attitude of the Vaiṣṇava, //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī// [//Vilāpa kusumāñjali// 6]. Vaiṣṇava is //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// That is Vaiṣṇava's qualification. He doesn't care for his own personal distresses. But he, a Vaiṣṇava, becomes aggrieved, distressed, when other is suffering. That is Vaiṣṇava. Prahlāda Mahārāja said,

> naivodvije para duratyaya-vaitaraṇyās
> tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ
> śoce tato vimukha-cetasa-
> māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān
> [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]

Prahlāda Mahārāja was so much harassed by his father, and his father was killed. And still, when he was offered benediction by the Lord, Nṛsiṁha-deva, he did not accept it. He said, //sa vai vaṇik// [[books:sb:7:10:4|[SB 7.10.4]]]: "My Lord, we are born in the family of //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.//" //Rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa... Asuras,// they are influenced by the two lower qualities, //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// And those who are //devatās,// they are influenced by the //sattva-guṇa.//

There are three //guṇas,// qualities, in the material world. //Sattva-guṇa... Tri-guṇamayī. Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. //Guṇamayī. Triguṇamayī// in this material world: //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// So those who are influenced by the //sattva-guṇa,// they are first class. First class means first class in this material world, not in the spiritual world. Spiritual world is different. That is //nirguṇa:// no material qualities. There is no first class, second class, third class. Everyone is first class. That is absolute. Kṛṣṇa is first class, His devotees are also first class. The trees are first class, the birds are first class, the cows are first class, the calves are first class. Therefore it is called absolute---no conception of relative, second class, third class, fourth class. No. Everything is first class.

//Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. Everything is composition of //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.// There is no classification. Either one is situated in //dāsya-rasa,// one is situated in //sākhya-rasa// or in //vātsalya-rasa// or //mādhurya-rasa,// they are all one. There is no such distinction. But there is variety. "You like this //rasa,// I like this //rasa,//" that is allowed.

So here, in this material world, they are being influenced by the three //rasas,// and Prahlāda Mahārāja, being the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu, he considered himself that "I am influenced by the //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.//" He's a Vaiṣṇava, he's above all //guṇas,// but a Vaiṣṇava is never proud of his //guṇa.// Actually, he does not feel like that, that he is very advanced, he is very enlightened. He always thinks, "I am the lowest."

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

This is Vaiṣṇava, that "I am the lowest of the human being." Just like //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// author, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, he said,

> purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha
> jagāi mādhāi haite muñi se pāpiṣṭha
> [[books:cc:adi:5:205|[Cc. Ādi 5.205]]]

Jagāi-Mādhāi, he was considered to be very sinful. "I am more sinful than Jagāi-Mādhāi." //Jagāi mādhāi haite muñi se pāpiṣṭha.// And my position? //Purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha:// "The worm in the stool, he has got some position, but I am lower than that."

> jagāi mādhāi haite muñi se pāpiṣṭha
> purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha
> [[books:cc:adi:5:205|[Cc. Ādi 5.205]]]

//Mora nāma yei laya tāra puṇya kṣaya// [[books:cc:adi:5:206|[Cc. Ādi 5.206]]]. "Anyone who takes my name, whatever little asset he has got on account of pious activities, he will lose it." In this way... This is not artificial. A Vaiṣṇava thinks like that. A Vaiṣṇava like Kavirāja Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī, they always think like that. That is Vaiṣṇava. They never think that he is very advanced. Never. So similarly, Draupadī is thinking her position, and what will be the position of Aśvatthāmā's mother. Aśvatthāmā's mother, she is also woman, and she is studying Aśvatthāmā's mother's position from her position. She's very much aggrieved on account of her sons' being killed. So she is thinking if Aśvatthāmā's mother is under the distress of her sons' being killed, what will be her position? She is disturbed, thinking of the position of Aśvatthāmā's mother. Personally, she is not at all aggrieved. She's aggrieved, but she is thinking the grief of Aśvatthāmā's mother more than her. This is Vaiṣṇava.

Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //śoce tato vimukha-cetasa indriyārtha-māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. "Because my father has done so much injustice unto me...," so Kṛṣṇa wanted to give him benediction. But he refused: "No. I do not require anything. I am quite happy. I don't want anything. And in exchange of my service... Because I have done some work as Vaiṣṇava, it is my duty..." //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. "It is my duty as a servant. I have tolerated all tribulations offered by my father. I was never disturbed. I preached amongst my class friends. Whatever possible I have done. But that does not mean I want some benefit. No. I am not a //bāniyā, vaṇik. Sa vai vaṇik.// So do not offer me any benediction. I am quite satisfied." So the question may be that "You are satisfied in spite of undergoing so much trouble? Still, you are...?" "Yes, I am satisfied. Yes, I am satisfied." "How?" //Tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ:// "Because I have learned by the grace of Nārada Muni how to chant Your holy name." That's it. //Tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta:// "This chanting of Your glorification is //mahāmṛta,// a great nectarean." //Tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ.// "My //cittaḥ,// my consciousness, is always absorbed in the thought of Your glorification. Therefore I am not at all happy [unhappy]." "You are not unhappy in spite of so much tribulation given by your father?" "Yes. I'm not at all." This is Vaiṣṇava. He cannot be unhappy. We see that Prahlāda Mahārāja was put into so much trouble by his father. Even, even this Draupadī, she was put into so much trouble---immediately, her sons are killed. But she is..., actually she is not unhappy. This is Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava cannot be unhappy in any circumstances.

//Ahaituky apratihatā.// That is explained. //Ahaituky apratihatā yenātmā samprasīdati// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. If you become situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you'll be so satisfied that in any circumstances nobody will be able to give you any trouble. This is Vaiṣṇava. //Yenātmā samprasīdati. Ātmā, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. There is no question of lamenting. But still, a Vaiṣṇava laments, not for his own purpose. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja says that //na udvije para.// Kṛṣṇa is //para.// Nṛsiṁha-deva is //para,// the Supreme. "O the Supreme, I am not at all disturbed." //Naivodvije para duratyayā-vaitaraṇyāḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. Why? //Tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]: "Because by the grace of Nārada Muni I have learned this art, how to chant Your holy name. That I have learned." //Tvad-vīrya-gāyana.// "I learned or not learned, but whenever I chant, then I merge into the ocean of nectarean."

A similar is stated about the Gosvāmīs. //Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat.// We have seen it practically. One big politician in Calcutta, C. R. Das, he was earning fifty thousand monthly, in those days. Fifty thousand means... I am speaking... He died in 1925. That means fifty years ago he was earning fifty thousand per month. Now fifty thousand means fifty //lakhs// nowadays. He was so rich man. But on the Congress resolution that the prominent members of the Congress, they should not cooperate with the government... And one of the item of noncooperation was they should not practice in the British court, because there is no justice. That was Gandhi's order, that "In the British court there is no justice. So why should you go there? Don't go." So this C. R. Das, on the resolution of the Congress---he was one of the prominent members---he gave up. So he had no income. So he had no income. The Congress was giving him five hundred rupees, pocket expenses, because he was such a rich man. So what is five hundred rupees for him? He was earning fifty thousand rupees and spending. So he could not bear that inconvenience. He died within a year. He was a rich man. He could not provide. And he was very charitably disposed. If somebody would come to him, he would say, "I have lost my all income. Now I have got this five hundred rupees. You can take it." He was such a charitably disposed. So anyway, he could not tolerate.

But a devotee... Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī, he also did the same thing. What is that? //Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat.// When he was inspired by Caitanya Mahāprabhu... He was a minister in charge of Nawab Hussain Shah's government, but he decided, "What is this nonsense ministership? Let me join Caitanya Mahāprabhu, preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness." So he did it. Therefore about him it is said, //tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīm.// He was associated with big, big men, //maṇḍala-pati.// He was minister. But he gave up: "What is this nonsense? It has no value." So if we compare with C. R. Das, he also gave up his income, but he died. But what happened to Rūpa Gosvāmī? Naturally, such a rich man, minister, he gave up his position, he should have also died because no income? No. He did not die. That is the difference. //Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna-kanthāśritau.// For benefiting the mass of people who are suffering for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to do them good, they became mendicant. //Kaupīna-kanthāśritau.// You have seen the picture of Rūpa Gosvāmī: a small loincloth, and nothing more. Then? He should have died. No. //Gopī-bhāvāmṛtām-mṛta-hari magno sadā.// They were enjoying, enjoying how the //gopīs// are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They were twenty-four hours thinking. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So similarly, Prahlāda Mahārāja says that //tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna...// The same philosophy, everywhere. What was spoken by Prahlāda Mahārāja millions of years ago, the same thing was perceived by Rūpa Gosvāmī five hundred years ago, and same thing can be perceived now also. //Tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ.// If you once become merged into the nectarean of chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, then you'll always remain happy. There is no doubt about it. //Tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. So either Rūpa Gosvāmī or Prahlāda Mahārāja or anyone, even up to date, they may face many difficulties, so-called difficulties. A Vaiṣṇava has no difficulty. But we see... Just like we see Prahlāda Mahārāja was in difficulty, Rūpa Gosvāmī was in difficulty. He was minister, and he became a mendicant. //Kaupīna-kanthāśritau.// No, he was not difficulty.

Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, his father's income was, in those days, twelve //lakhs// of rupees. And in Rādhā-kuṇḍa he lived, taking little butter every alternate day. And //saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ:// and he was offering obeisances also, counting. Just like we count chanting, he was counting, that "I must offer hundred times obeisances." That he was doing. This is Gosvāmī's behavior. So a Vaiṣṇava has no difficulty. The same thing is exemplified by Draupadī. She is aggrieved on account of her sons' being killed by Aśvatthāmā. Now she is feeling more for the mother of Aśvatthāmā, how she would feel if her son is killed. This is Vaiṣṇava, //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī. Kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. A Vaiṣṇava is //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// A Vaiṣṇava has personally no distress. Anywhere he can sit down and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// And where is his difficulty? //Tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ.// He has no. But why he takes so much distress? Now, because //tato vimukha-cetasaḥ. Śoce tato vimukha-cetasaḥ.// Prahlāda Mahārāja says, "I am aggrieved for the rascals who are not devotees." //Tato vimukha-cetasaḥ. Vimukha// means they are not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So a Vaiṣṇava is disturbed, perturbed, how these rascals are suffering so much in material condition. So how to teach them Kṛṣṇa consciousness, how to make them happy, this is Vaiṣṇava's concern. Vaiṣṇava concern, personal, there is no concern. Vaiṣṇava is not satisfied that "Because I have no problem, I can chant anywhere and enjoy." No. Still, Vaiṣṇava takes the risk. As Prahlāda Mahārāja said, that "I do not wish to go alone to Vaikuṇṭha or anywhere, my Lord, unless I can deliver all these rascals." This is Vaiṣṇava. He knew that all the..., //Vimukha-cetasaḥ.// These materialistic persons, they are engaged in planning for material happiness. They are working so hard, becoming baffled without any benefit. So //māyā-sukhāya bharam ud...:// many, many plans, many, many skyscraper buildings, roads and motorcars. What is the real purpose? The purpose is they want to be happy. But that is not possible. Therefore they are //vimūḍhān,// rascals. They are going in the wrong way. How to divert their attention to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then they will be happy.

These European, American boys, they are coming from rich family. They have, even nationally, they have got big, big skyscraper buildings, motorcar, and why they have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Because they were not happy. It is a fact. They were not happy. So a Vaiṣṇava can understand this, that outwardly, externally, they may have nice dress or nice building or nice motorcar, but internally they are so unhappy that they rise up to the top of the skyscraper building and fall down to commit suicide. This is his position. The Vaiṣṇava can understand that //bharam udvahato vimūḍhān.// They are making skyscraper building, but there is no happiness. It is simply a, what is called, a gorgeous arrangement only. Otherwise, there is not a drop of happiness. //Śoce tato vimukha-cetasaḥ.//

So the feeling of Vaiṣṇava is like that. Similarly, Draupadī is Vaiṣṇavī. She is feeling more than herself, the wife of Droṇācārya, mother of Aśvatthāmā, how she would feel. Therefore Vaiṣṇava's qualification is //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// Personally a Vaiṣṇava is not unhappy, but a Vaiṣṇava becomes unhappy for others' distress. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī. Kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye.// This is Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī's prayer to Sanātana Gosvāmī. //Vairāgya-vidyā.// He was feeling obligation to Sanātana Gosvāmī, how Sanātana Gosvāmī taught him //vairāgya-vidyā.// So, //kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. This is Vaiṣṇava's position. So Kuntī... And from ordinary moral point of view, it is said by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, //ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu sa paṇḍitaḥ.// Anyone who can see in others, feeling like himself... If I cut your throat, you'll feel pain. How I know it? Now, because if you cut my throat I'll feel pain. So //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// Here Kuntī is feeling that, that "I am already suffering because my sons are killed. So why I am going to retaliate? I am going to give the same suffering to the mother of Aśvatthāmā by killing her son." This is Vaiṣṇava feeling. This is Vaiṣṇava. So Vaiṣṇava is not aggrieved or distressed for personal interest, and Vaiṣṇava is always feeling how others will be happy. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is very, very satisfied with the Vaiṣṇava. //Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]].

So you have taken to the vow of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Try to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. And we have got little success. One politician in USA, he has remarked that "This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is increasing like an epidemic." [laughter] He has said that. "And if we do not check it, one day it may take our government." He has opined like that. So any intelligent man can know what is the ultimate result. Everyone... Because mass of people, if they take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then government is yours. That is a fact. And if the Kṛṣṇa consciousness government is there---no meat-eating, no smoking, no illicit sex, so many no's---the demons will die. [laughter] That is the position.

Thank you very much.
