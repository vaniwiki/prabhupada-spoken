**Pṛthu-putra:**
He asks how many pages. Yogānanda asks how many... Because they say that you sent a newsletter to all the GBCs. He asks how many pages was the newsletter. And I said just two lines.

**Prabhupāda:**
Newspaper?

**Hari-śauri:**
Newsletter to the GBC.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that newsletter?

**Hari-śauri:**
You said, "Please be informed that Nitāi has become a venomous serpent."

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Hari-śauri:**
"Please be informed that Nitāi has become a venomous serpent."

**Prabhupāda:**
So this has been sent? [laughs]

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes, to the GBC.

**Pṛthu-putra:**
Yogānanda asked how many pages, when he heard about the newsletter. He thought that you spoke so long about that. And I just said, "Just two lines." But they never asked me what the letter said.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, two lines is sufficient.

**Dhanañjaya:**
//Punar mūṣiko bhava.//

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Dhanañjaya:**
//Punar mūṣiko bhava.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is exactly the same case. //Punar mūṣiko bhava,// you know the whole story? A //mūṣika,// a mouse, was made a tiger, and the tiger wanted to eat the saintly person who made him. First of all he was mouse. So he came to the saintly person, "Sir, I am troubled. Give me some benediction." "What do you want?" "Now, the cat always chases." "All right, you become cat so that you'll not be attacked." Then after some time he came, "I am being chased by the dog." "All right, you become a dog." From cat to dog, from mouse to... Then again he came. "Still they are chasing me. Fox." And then in this way, and ultimately he was made a tiger. And after becoming a tiger, he began to look, staring on the... "What do you mean by this?" "I shall eat you." "Oh? You become again a mouse." [laughter] Again he become mouse. That's all.

**Hari-śauri:**
The perfect example.

**Pṛthu-putra:**
Now he look like dirty. You know, like brown. The //dhotī's// not white. It's like brownish, you know, like...

**Prabhupāda:**
He harassed. "He has not increased my..." Hearing and hearing, he wants to go. So why not, if he found some real disciplic succession, some //bābājī,// why he did not remain there? He is criticizing that our is not in the proper succession. So why he did not remain where he found the proper succession? Why he's sometimes in Vṛndāvana, sometimes Delhi, sometimes here? Why he is loitering? Crazy. Unfortunate. Unnecessarily picking out some trouble.

**Hari-śauri:**
Fault-finding.

**Prabhupāda:**
The //bābājīs,// they are against anything preaching. They are very, very much against preaching. So I am preaching. //Bābājīs,// the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// and all of them, their idea is that I am ruining this //bhajana// and Hindu //dharma.// This is the propaganda. What I am writing, they are all wrong, and they are making... And they try to poison my disciples as far as possible so that the whole institution may be poisoned and break. This is their propaganda.

**Hari-śauri:**
That was one thing that Nitāi put in his letter, that the teachings of ISKCON are completely opposite or contradictory to what is actually in the //śāstra.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Now he has become tiger. He wants to kill that philosophy. When he did not know anything, he came to us. Now he has become learned, he wants to criticize. The same philosophy: "You have made me tiger, now I can see you are my eatable. [indistinct]" [laughs] He could not find out any other eatable. "I shall eat you." The rascal. What can be done? [end]
