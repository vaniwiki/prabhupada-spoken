====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.5.6 ======

**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of verse, etc.] [break]

> evaṁ manaḥ karma-vaśaṁ prayuṅkte
> avidyayātmany upadhīyamāne
> prītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve
> na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat
> [[books:sb:5:5:6|[SB 5.5.6]]]

[01:22]

Translation: "When the living entity is covered by the mode of ignorance, he does not understand the individual living being and the supreme living being, and his mind is subjugated to fruitive activity. Therefore, until one has love for Lord Vāsudeva, who is none other than Myself, he is certainly not delivered from having to accept a material body again and again." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**

> evaṁ manaḥ karma-vaśaṁ prayuṅkte
> avidyayātmany upadhīyamāne
> prītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve
> na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat
> [[books:sb:5:5:6|[SB 5.5.6]]]

This is another important verse. The problem is presented, //deha-yogena. Deha-yogena,// this body, contact with this material body, this is the problem. But nobody knows it. Especially in these days they cannot understand that "This material body is a foreign element, and somehow or other I am victimized, I am entrapped within this body." This problem is real problem. But they do not know. And this is called //avidyā,// ignorance.

There are two kinds of strong //avidyā,// ignorance, unawareness. //Sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa. Rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa// is covering. //Tamo-guṇa// is very densely covering, and //rajo-guṇa// little open, and //sattva-guṇa// means //prakāśa,// there is illumination, brahminical qualifications. When one is in the //sattva-guṇa,// then he can understand that "I am not this body. I am different from this body." For them, those who are in the //sattva-guṇa,// for them it is easier. So therefore the process is... Human civilization means not to drag somebody who is already in the //sattva-guṇa// or in the family of //sattva-guṇa,// to drag him down to the //tamo-guṇa.// The modern civilization is like that. The allurement of material civilization is so strong and so bad that those who are by pious activities born in //brāhmaṇa// family, they are being dragged to the //tamo-guṇa// behavior like //śūdras.// They are learning how to drink, how to eat meat, how to have illicit sex. These are the symptoms of //tamo-guṇa,// lowest type of //tamo-guṇa.//

There are different degrees of //guṇa.// The degrees are so mixed up. Therefore three //guṇas// is manifested into 8,400,000's of different forms of life, mixture. You can calculate---we have several times calculated---three multiplied by three equal nine. Nine multiplied by nine, eighty-one. So therefore there are so many varieties. So human civilization should be so arranged that never mind it is so mixed up, you have to gradually draw him again to the //sattva-guṇa.// That is human civilization. Not that drag him again to the //tamo-guṇa.// Somebody, by pious activities, by good work, he's already in the //sattva-guṇa,// but the arrangement, the social, political, economical arrangement, is so bad that one is dragged to the //tamo-guṇa.// This is not civilization. This is degradation. Civilization means elevation. The aim is how to become disconnected with this material body. This is civilization. Otherwise that is not civilization, it is animal life. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kunape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13].

So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an attempt to bring the human society into the proper platform of civilization. It is a very scientific movement. How it is done? Here it is said, //prītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve. Prītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat.// This is the problem. So by gradual process, to bring one to the platform of //vāsudeve prītir,// that is //bhakti. Prītir// means love, how to love Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. That is civilization---to bring one to the platform of loving Kṛṣṇa, //prītir// to Vāsudeva. //Vāsudeva sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. Just like if you love somebody, the intense love is that your lover or beloved is everything. That is love. Just like a mother loves her child. So she is always anxious to take care of the child. Whole attention is on the child. These are examples. These are not actually love, but a perverted reflection of love. We can understand what is love. This love does not stand, but nature dictates that you love your child like this, you love your husband like this, your wife like this, your country like this, your society like this. There are different grades of loving demonstration. That loving demonstration, when it will be concentrated on Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, that is the highest perfection of life.

Therefore it is said, //prītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve.// One may have //prītir...// Because we do not know Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, we have got natural tendency to love, but we do not know where to place love. If we place our loving tendency unto Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, then that tendency becomes fruitful and perfection. That is wanted. Therefore it is said that,

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed ratiṁ yadi
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

> vāsudeve bhagavati
> bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ
> janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ
> jñānam ca yad ahaitukam
> [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]

If you place your loving tendency to Vāsudeva, then //vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ.// This can be done perfectly by //bhakti-yoga,// not by any other. There are different //yoga// system. Everything is mixed up with little //bhakti,// but... Just like //karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga, dhyāna-yoga,// there are different. But the real //yoga// means loving Vāsudeva, Bhagavān. Therefore Bhagavān says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, yogināṁ api sarveṣāṁ// [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]. All other //yoga// system, there is little tinge of //vāsudeva-bhakti,// but not cent percent pure. It is mixed. //Miśra-bhakti. Miśra-bhakti// will not be immediately fruitful. It will take long, long time. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. Everything, there is some //bhakti-yoga,// but if it is not pure, then it will take very, very, very, very long time, //bahūnāṁ janmanām.// One //janma// means hundreds of years. We are not talking of any other //janma.// Even human form of life. Because those who are advanced in spiritual life, there is every possibility for getting next life a human being. Otherwise nobody knows. Those who are ignorant, they do not know. There will be change of body---//tathā dehāntara prāptir//---that is a fact. But those who are in the //sattva-guṇa,// they are sure to get next life in the human society. //Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sanjāyate// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. This //śucīnāṁ,// pure //brāhmaṇa,// and //śrīmatāṁ,// very rich //vaiśya,// or //kṣatriya...// Kings and mercantile community, they are rich, //śrīmat. Śrī// means opulence, and //mat// means one who has. //Śrīmatām.//

So this is a chance that even if you are failure in this life, somehow or other you get chance next life again human form of life, either in a very nice pure //brāhmaṇa// family or Vaiṣṇava family. Vaiṣṇava family is better than //brāhmaṇa// family. [break] ...ringing the //karatālas,// chanting, dancing, offering obeisances to the Lord, temple atmosphere. Don't think it is ordinary opportunity. It is very great opportunity. From the very beginning of life they are getting impression, //bhakti-yoga. Vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yoga.// These are not going in vain. Even a child is playing //karatāla,// imitation. Not imitation; he's given the chance. He was previously Vaiṣṇava. Somehow or other, he could not make his life perfect. Therefore he is given again chance. So naturally he has got tendency to play the //karatāla,// to offer flower here, to offer obeisances. They take pleasure. It is due to previous life, //yogas.// But it was not perfectly done, so somehow or other they are getting chance from the very beginning of life. It does not mean that if somebody did not get the chance from the very beginning of life he cannot. He can be also. So..., but the ultimate aim is //vāsudeve. Prītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve.// This is the ultimate goal. You have to come to this stage, //vāsudeva sarvam iti,// fully, firmly convinced that "Vāsudeva is my life. Vāsudeva is everything. Kṛṣṇa is my life." And the highest perfection is visible in the Vṛndāvana atmosphere, especially by the //gopīs.// Everyone in Vṛndāvana, even the trees and plants, even the grains of sand, everyone is attached to Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana.

So not all of a sudden we can get that highest stage of life, of Vṛndāvana attachment. But still, wherever we stay, if we practice this //bhakti-yoga,// as we are preaching... And it is becoming successful. People are taking. Those who were so-called //mlecchas// and //yavanas,// they are also taking to Vāsudeva. Their love for Kṛṣṇa is increasing. That is natural. It is said in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta, nitya siddha kṛṣṇa bhakti// [[books:cc:madhya:22:107|[Cc. Madhya 22.107]]]. //Nitya siddha.// Just like I am, or you are, we are eternal. //Nityo śāśvato 'yam na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. We are not destroyed by the destruction of the body. We remain, continue to remain. Similarly, our devotion to Kṛṣṇa continues. It is simply covered. //Avidyayātmāny upādhiyamāne. Avidya.// This is //avidya.// We forget Kṛṣṇa, that is //avidya.// And as soon as we take Kṛṣṇa as our life and soul, that is //vidya.// You can do. Anyone can do very easily. Kṛṣṇa says, therefore, //sarva dharmān parityajya mam ekam śaraṇaṁ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Why? Any other so-called religious system, that is //avidya//---will keep you in ignorance. There is no light. And the Vedic injunction is that "Don't keep yourself in the darkness of ignorance." //Tamasi mā jyoti gamaḥ.//

That //jyotiḥ// means to love Kṛṣṇa. And loving affairs of Kṛṣṇa is in the spiritual world. That is //jyotiḥ, jyotirmāyā dhāma,// self-effulgent. //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koti// [Bs. 5.40]. There is no darkness. Just like in the sun there is no question of darkness. The examples are here. We can understand what is //jyotiḥ.// We can see that there is no darkness in the sun planet. It is all glowing effulgence. Similarly, in the spiritual world there is no ignorance. Everyone is //śuddha-sattva.// Not only //sattva-guṇa,// but //śuddha-sattva. Sattvaṁ viśuddhaṁ vāsudeva-śabditaḥ.// Here, in this material world, there are three qualities: //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// So none of these //guṇas// are pure. There is a mixture. And because there is mixture, therefore we see so many varieties. But we have to come to the platform of //sattva-guṇa.// And that process is hearing. This is the best process. //Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]. If you hear regularly //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...// We are therefore stressing: "Always hear, always read, always hear." //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. //Nitya.// If you can constantly, twenty-four hours, if you hear and chant... Hear means somebody chants or you chant yourself or hear, or some of your colleague may chant, you hear. Or he may hear, you may chant. This process must go on. This is //śrāvaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. //Viṣṇoḥ.// That is Bhāgavata. Not any other nonsense talks, gossiping. Simply hear and chant. Then //śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇa.// If you seriously hear and chant, seriously---"Yes, this life I shall engage only for increasing my love of Vāsudeva"---if you are determined, it can be done. There is no difficulty. And as soon as you do this, you increase fully your love for Vasudeva, then there is no more chance of contacting material body.

> janma karma ca divyam
> me yo janati tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti...
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

That is the same thing.

And if you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, if you do not increase your natural love for Kṛṣṇa, then //na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat.// There is no chance. They have no chance. You may take birth next life in a very rich family, in a //brāhmaṇa// family, //yogo-bhraṣṭaḥ,// but that is also not release. Again you may fall down. Just like we see there are so many... Just like you Americans, you are born in rich family, rich nation, but falling down, becoming hippies. Falling down. So there is chance. Not that it is guaranteed, "Because I am born in a rich family or //brāhmaṇa// family, that is guarantee." No guarantee. This //māyā// is so strong that it is only trying to drag you---drag you down, drag you down. So many influences. So therefore we sometimes see that these Americans, they are so fortunate they are born in a country where there is no poverty, there is no scarcity. But still, because the leaders are rascals, they have arranged for meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. Advertise. Advertise naked woman and, what is called, beef-eaters, and liquor. This is going on. Advertise cigarettes, just to pull them down again, go to hell. //Punar mūṣiko bhava.// They do not know what dangerous civilization this is dragging them. Therefore sometimes some saner section of the old men, they come to me, they offer their thanks: "Swāmījī, it is a great fortune that you have come to our country." They acknowledge. Yes, that's a fact. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is a great fortunate movement. And especially in the Western countries, that's a fact.

So those who have taken, take it very seriously. Increase your love for Kṛṣṇa. //Prītir na yāvan mayi vāsudeve na mucyate deha yogena...// They do not know what is the actual problem of life. The actual problem of life is //deha-yoga,// this foreign body. We are accepting one type---//bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]---accepting one type of body. Therefore they have, these rascals, leaders in Europe and America, they have concluded there is no birth. That's all. Because if they accept there is life after death, then it is horrible for them. So they have dismissed: "No, there is no birth." Big, big so-called professors, learned scholars, they talk foolishly: "Swāmījī, after this body is finished, everything is finished." That is their conclusion. And the body comes by accident, //kim anyat kāma-haitukam. Asatyam apratiṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur anīśvaram// [[books:bg:16:8|[Bg. 16.8]]].

So this kind of civilization is very dangerous. Very, very dangerous. So at least those who have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they should be very, very cautious about this dangerous type of civilization. People are suffering. Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and be happy and perfect.

Thank you very much.
