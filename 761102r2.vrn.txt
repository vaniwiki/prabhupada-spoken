**Prabhupāda:**
And they continually going on giving information---rocks and sand. Why do you take so much trouble of going to Mars and this? If your go.... It is already concluded that we shall give this, because they are already under the impression that all other planets are vacant. The same thing, after spending millions of dollars, they're giving the same verdict. So why do this business? Simply cheating. They're cheating their boss, that "We are making research." The result of research is the same. They're silent now, this Mars excursion?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What they'll say? There is nothing to say. They do not go, and even they go, they take photograph from millions of miles, what is the value of these things? But people are accepting that "Oh, scientific research." Perhaps I am the only man in the world who is protesting. [laughs] Eh? Everyone is accepting, "Oh, this is scientific."

**Hari-śauri:**
People are being duped now into believing that advancement means simply to research. Not to actually find out anything valuable, but just to do some research. They think that that's the whole thing, education means just to research.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is the European. You don't get the result, go on researching and spoil the money.

**Jagadīśa:**
Kṛṣṇa has manufactured everything in such a complicated way that their search is never-ending.

**Prabhupāda:**
That article written by Svarūpa Dāmodara in the recent //Back to Godhead...//

**Hari-śauri:**
That was not... Oh, which one?

**Prabhupāda:**
The recent this.

**Hari-śauri:**
The newest one? That was not by Svarūpa Dāmodara. That was by...

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got?

**Hari-śauri:**
Dāmodara dāsa and Jagajīvana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Svarūpa Dāmodara is different. Oh.

**Hari-śauri:**
This is more like a commentary on science as it exists today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Hari-śauri:**
This is like a presentation of science for the layman.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Yes, this article.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Hmm. //Prabhu-sam...// [break] [end]
