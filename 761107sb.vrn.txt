Translation: "My transcendental body, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,// looks exactly like a human form, but it is not a material human body. It is inconceivable. I am not forced by nature to accept a particular type of body; I take on a body by My own sweet will. My heart is also spiritual, and I always think of the welfare of My devotees. Therefore within My heart can be found the process of devotional service, which is meant for the devotees. Far from My heart have I abandoned irreligion, or //adharma,// and nondevotional activities. They do not appeal to Me. Due to all these transcendental qualities, people generally pray to Me as Ṛṣabhādeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the best of all living entities." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**

> idaṁ śarīraṁ mama durvibhāvyaṁ
> sattvaṁ hi me hṛdayaṁ yatra dharmaḥ
> pṛṣṭhe kṛto me yad adharma ārād
> ato hi māṁ ṛṣabhaṁ prāhur āryāḥ
> [[books:sb:5:5:19|[SB 5.5.19]]]

So God, whether impersonal or personal, that we cannot conclude by our speculation. It is not possible. //Durvibhāvyam. Durvibhāvyam// means beyond your conception, beyond your speculation. But He says that //idaṁ śarīram.// He has got His body; He is not impersonal. He comes sometimes as incarnation. We can see Kṛṣṇa with two hands, two legs, one head.

> Veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda dalāyatākṣaṁ 
> barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam 
> [Bs. 5.30].

This is described in the Vedic literature. He has two hands and He is playing on flute. He has got the peacock feather on His head. It is not imagination. The Kṛṣṇa //arcā-mūrti,// it is not imagination, as rascals think, that they have imaginated an idol. This is not idol worship. This is actually... I have several times explained that here is Kṛṣṇa, personally present. We should always think like that, not that it is idol worship. But //durvibhāvyam// means although He is present, the less intelligent class of men, they will think that "They are worshiping one statue." But that is not possible.

You do not know what is the form of the Lord because your present senses are imperfect. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam idriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]---the Lord's name, His form, His pastimes---//na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ//---our present senses are unable to conceive. Just like the soul is there within the body but nobody can see where is that soul. Similarly, God is also within this body, but nobody can see. It is specifically mentioned, //īśvaraḥ sarva bhūtānām hṛd deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. The Lord is situated in everyone's heart, but find out the heart, where is God. There is, but you cannot see. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. Present senses are unable to see. You have to prepare your eyes. Just like with cataract you cannot see anything. You have to undergo surgical operation. Then you will see. That surgical operation process is //bhakti.//

> sarvopādhi vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalam
> hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa sevanaṁ
> bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

//Hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa sevanam.// If God has no form, how He is Hṛṣīkeśa, and how we can serve with our senses? //Hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa sevanam.// That is //bhakti.//

So God has form, but it is inconceivable by us. But from the //śāstra// we can understand what kind of body God has. Just like in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is explained,

> aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti
> paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciraṁ jaganti
> ānanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya
> ānanda-sat-ujjvala-vigraha...
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.32]

Now, it is inconceivable. //Aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya vṛtti-manti.// Now we have got this understanding that we can see with our eyes, but God can not only see with His eyes, He can eat with His eyes. This is inconceivable. We shall think, "How it is possible that one can eat with His eyes?" Therefore //śāstra// says, //aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya vṛtti-manti// [Bs. 5.32]. Just like we offer foodstuff to the Deity. The atheist will say, "Oh, you have offered this, so many nice foodstuff, but He has not eaten. It is there, lying there." But he does not know that God has His //indriyas, sakalendriya vṛtti-manti.// As soon as sees the foodstuff is offered, He has eaten. That they do not know. This is inconceivable. Unless we accept the inconceivable energy of the Lord, there is no question of God. So He can eat by seeing. //Aggāni yasya sakalendriya vṛtti-manti paśyanti pānti kalayanti ciraṁ jaganti// [Bs. 5.32]. He can offer you blessing, everything, by one //aṅga.// By one part of the body He can do everything. This is inconceivable. //Adhokṣaja.// Therefore another name of God is called Adhokṣaja. //Akṣaja jñānam adhaḥ kṛta.//

Our knowledge is sense perception. Sense perception, //akṣaja jñānam.// That will not act there. //Acintya.// Therefore we have to accept in that way. //Idaṁ śarīram,// but He has His body. He has His body, and because we cannot conceive, He, out of His causeless mercy, He presents Himself in a form which we can see. That is //arcā-vigraha, arcā-mūrti.// A //vigraha. Arcā// means the form which we can worship. If God is impersonal... //Avyaktāsakta-cetasām. Kleśo adhikataras teṣām.// If we accept God as impersonal... He is not impersonal. He says //idaṁ śarīram.// He is personal. But our present senses cannot perceive. That is the difficulty. Therefore out of His causeless mercy He has appeared in a form which you can see, you can touch, you can dress, you can offer garland, you can offer food---to accept your service. That is God's mercy. Don't think that "Because God mercifully has come before Me in a form which we can perceive, which we can see, with which we can serve," not that "He is not God." That is rascaldom. God is there. Otherwise Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as soon as He entered the Jagannātha's temple, immediately He fainted. Does it mean He made a fun? No. He saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead present there.

So it requires eyes to see God. That eyes you have to prepare. What is that eyes? //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena// [Bs. 5.38]. You have to apply eyes' ointment. Just like there is some medicine, eye ointment, which you apply---you can see very distinctly---similarly, that ointment is //premāñjana.// If you develop love for God... Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He is in ecstasy, always in love. He can see. Similarly, if you develop your love for God, then you can see. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena// [Bs. 5.38]. This //premāñjana,// this ointment of love, is //bhakti.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also it is said, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. //Tattvataḥ,// not superficially---actually what He is. That you can understand through //bhakti,// not any other process. Kṛṣṇa does not say that you can..., //bhakta...,// not //bhakta// but //jñānam.// There are //jñānīs.// There are //yogīs.// No. They cannot understand //bhagavān tattvataḥ.// Therefore Bhagavān says,

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

"Even persons who are already //siddha,// perfect //jñānīs, yogīs,// they are also unable to see Me." If one, however, by good fortune---the //yogīs,// the //jñānīs//---come in contact with a //bhakta,// then, by the mercy of the //bhakta,// by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, he can see. Otherwise //durvibhāvya, idaṁ śarīraṁ mama.// The Supreme Personality says, //mama:// "My. My body. I have got My body," but //durvibhāvyam.//

So we have to understand God as He says. Don't imagine. Don't speculate. That is useless.

> panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo
> vāyor athāpi manaso muni-puṇgavānāṁ
> so 'py asti yat-prapada-sīmny avicintya tattve
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.34]

//Avicintya// or //durvibhāvyam,// the same thing. Even if you try to understand God or want to go to God //vāyor athāpi,// by your airplane at the speed of the mind, not ordinary speed... Mind's speed you can imagine. You are sitting here, and fifteen thousand miles away, New York, you can immediately see your room there. This is mind's speed. Immediately, within a second. Just imagine how much the mind is speedy. Mind is subtle. Everyone, you have got mind, I have got mind, but I cannot see your mind; you cannot see my mind. Subtle. This is a material thing. //Bhūmir āpo'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. //Khaṁ mano, mano.// The sky, ether, we cannot see but we can perceive. When you press the sky [claps] like this, there is sound. You can understand, "Here is sky." But mind you cannot see, still subtle.

> indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur
> indriyebhyaḥ paraṁ manaḥ
> manasas tu paro buddhir
> buddhes para tu yaḥ
> [[books:bg:3:42|[Bg. 3.42]]]

So the soul is so subtle, you cannot see. You cannot see sky, and still finer is the mind, still finer is intelligence, and still finer, the soul. So how can you see? With your gross eyes it is not possible. Therefore they are bewildered, how the soul is being transferred from one body to another. They see the gross body. Kṛṣṇa says, //na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]], //tathā dehāntara prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. But doctors, medical men, scientists, they cannot see that where is the soul, how the soul is transmigrating. These are all //durvibhāvya,// inconceivable.

Therefore we have to hear from the authorities, from Kṛṣṇa, that there is soul; there is //ātmā;// there is transmigration. And everything, what is spoken in the //śāstra,// they are fact. But we do not consult //śāstra.// We become scientists. We become philosophers. With gross understanding, dull understanding, poor understanding, how you can understand yourself and God? So there is no question of self-realization by your gross understanding. You have to understand by hearing. Therefore to get real knowledge is not by the eyes and senses but by the ear. Therefore Vedic knowledge is called //śruti.// You have to receive knowledge---//śruti. Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. Why? The //guru// means who is fully aware of the //śruti, śrotriyam,// one who has perfectly listened to his //guru. Śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham.// And by hearing only, he has become //brahma-niṣṭham,// without any doubt: "Yes, there is God. Yes." We have to approach such person who has perfectly listened to his... //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. So by //śruti,// by hearing oral reception. Just like there is practical example: Suppose you are sleeping, and somebody is coming to do you some harm, to kill you, but another person is warning you, "Please get up! Get up! Somebody is coming to kill you, somebody." But it will act, because while other senses are practically dead, the ear is working. By hearing, you can get up. This is practical.

So at the present moment we are sleeping, sleeping in the darkness. Therefore to get knowledge we have to use our ears. //Śravaṇam.// Therefore to enter into the devotional service one has to use this ear, //śravaṇam. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda...// And //śravaṇam// about whom? //Śravaṇam// about Viṣṇu, //śravaṇaṁ kīrta...// Not of others. //Śravaṇam.// They say that "You can hear anything." No.

> śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
> smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam
> arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ
> sakhyam ātma-nivedanam
> [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]

This is the process. //Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet, śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham// [MU 1.2.12]. These are the injunction. //Ādau gurvāśrayaṁ sad dharma pṛcchat sādhu mārganu gamanam.// These are the process.

So Ṛṣabhadeva said that "I have got My body," //idaṁ śarīram,// when He appears to solve our problem whether God is personal or impersonal. Impersonal is there, there is no doubt, but what is that impersonal? //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagat avyakta-mūrtinā// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. That is impersonal. No, He's //mayā:// "By Me." That means His energy. His energy is distributed throughout the whole creation, cosmic manifestation. But He is still there. //Mayā.// Unless He is there... Not that because He is spread everywhere---//vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]---it does not mean He is finished. That is material understanding. In the materially, if you take a piece of paper and make it a small pieces and throw it, then the original paper is no longer existing. That is material conception. But spiritual conception? //Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. That is spiritual idea. If you take cent percent God from God, still He is cent percent. That is //pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate. Īśāvāsyam idam.// So Kṛṣṇa says that //mayā,// "In My another feature, //vasudeva// feature," //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam.// Everything is God, but everything is not God. That is explained by God.

> mayā tatam idam sarva
> jagat avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> nahaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]

The Māyāvādīs, the poor fund knowledge, they say, "Why you are worshiping God here? He is everywhere." "He is everywhere? He is in the temple also." "No," they will say, "not in the temple. He is everywhere except in the temple. Don't go to the temple." This is rascaldom. If God is everywhere, why He is not in the temple? So this is their knowledge, poor fund of knowledge. //Alpa-medhasā. Alpa-medhasā. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]].

So God has form, but He is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.// He is not... When it is said, the //nirākāra,// "no form," that does not mean that He has no //ākāra.// The //ākāra,// or the form which we understand, He hasn't got that form. He is //sac-cid-ānanda vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. Otherwise how He can accept your offerings? Kṛṣṇa says that //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati, tad aham aśnāmi// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. He says, "I eat." So if He has no mouth, how He can eat? And therefore the Vedic literature informs us that //paśyati acakṣuḥ:// "He sees, but He has no eyes." When the Vedic literature says that He has no eyes, that means He has no eyes like us. But He has got eyes; otherwise how He sees? //Paśyati acakṣuḥ śṛṇoti akarṇaḥ.// He can hear; otherwise what is the use of offering prayer? Yes, He hears, but //akarṇa,// not that He has got ears like you. He is in the Vaikuṇṭha, many, many millions' and trillions' miles away, but still, you are offering here, "//Govindam ādi puruṣam.//" He is hearing. He is here. //Sarvatra pāṇi pādas tat.// This thing should be understood.

And because we do not understand---everything we try to test with our limited understanding---therefore we do not believe in the activities of the Lord, and we are deceived in that way. God is all-powerful, but when we hear that God at the age of seven years age, old, He lifted the Govardhana Hill, immediately we dismiss, "Oh, this is all mythology." Why? If He has got inconceivable power---He is all-powerful---is it very difficult for Him to lift the Govardhana Hill? "No, we don't believe in God. Even if we believe, we want to believe in our own way." That is //bhāvyam,// conceivable. But He is //durvibhāvyam.// You cannot conceive. Two contradict things. Just like here Kṛṣṇa said, Ṛṣabhadeva, that //sattvaṁ hi me hṛdayaṁ yatra dharmaḥ.// The //dharma// and //adharma,// they are two contradictory thought. But He is the source of //dharma// and //adharma// both. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Adharma,// which we hate, that is also coming from God. //Janmādya asya yataḥ.// Otherwise... That is explained here. //Pṛṣṭhe. Pṛṣṭhe kṛto me yad adharma ārāt.// So //adharma// is also there in God---on the back side. So is there any difference between back side and front side? //Advaya-jñāna,// absolute. No.

So these things have to be understood, that both //dharma// and //adharma,// they are coming from... He is the original soul. //Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante// [Taittirīya Upaniṣad 3.1]. Everything is coming from Him. So //dharma// and //adharma,// that is duality, duality understanding within this material world. In the spiritual world there is no such thing. The //dharma// and //adharma// is the same thing because the same source. This to be understood from right sources, right person. Then we can understand. But He comes, Kṛṣṇa comes, out of His causeless mercy to inform us. Not only Kṛṣṇa---many other incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. Just like Ṛṣabhadeva, He is also incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. He is explaining Himself. So we should take advantage of understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, from the Absolute Truth. Don't speculate. Speculation has no meaning. So we have got this instruction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So if we are serious about understanding about God, then we can hear from Him. And whatever He says, whatever He instructs, you take it. Then our life will be successful. And if we speculate, //panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampra...//

> ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi
> na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ
> sevonmukhe hi jihvādau
> svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]

So this is the process. We must be ready to surrender to Him. We must be ready to render service unto Him. Then our spiritual life will be revived. At the present moment we are covered by the material conception of life: "I am this body," "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //kṣatriya.//" These are all designations, //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. When you become free from these all these designation---you become purified---then you can develop your love for God. //Hṛṣīkena hṛṣīkeśa sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.//

Thank you very much.
