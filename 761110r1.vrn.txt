**Prabhupāda:**
...still in the jungle. And they show the picture, Darwin's theory...

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They are stoning animals.

**Hari-śauri:**
Prehistoric man.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Hari-śauri:**
Prehistoric man.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So now civilization is not stoning the animals. "I have [indistinct] slaughterhouses." This is their civilization.

**Hari-śauri:**
Killing in big slaughterhouse.

**Prabhupāda:**
They remain the same thing, the animal eaters, but the process has changed. Process changed. Instead of stoning, in big, big cities...

[someone asks something in Hindi] [aside: Ah. All right.]

**Prabhupāda:**
...you stand here, open up to the slaughterhouse, butcher. This is going on. Your standard remains the same.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah, doing the same thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply the, what is called, operation is changed. That is civilization. They have taken this is standard also in India. There was lamp, and the same lamp, now it is electricity, electric power. This is their civilization. There was some car, horse carriage, horse-drawn carriage or cow-drawn carriage. Now you have a car. Is it not?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not know what is civilization. This is actual fact. They do not know what is civilization. This is civilization, huh? //Brāhmaṇa.// And they will think, "What is this nonsense, to worship a //brāhmaṇa,// to give food to the //brāhmaṇa-bhojana?//" They have manufactured, "Why //brāhmaṇa-bhojana?// There is [indistinct] they're //daridra-nārāyaṇa.//" [end]
