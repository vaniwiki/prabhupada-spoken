**Prabhupāda:**
...punishment, Kali-yuga. But this is proper punishment. Because the public also, they’re not anxious to become God conscious. 

**Hari Śauri:**
No. They’re anxious to avoid it. There’s a few, but not many.

**Prabhupāda:**
So they must be punished, with such rogues and thieves. That is stated in the //Bhāgavatam.// It is nature’s punishment. [end]
