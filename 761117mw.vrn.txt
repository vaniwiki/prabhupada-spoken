[Recording breaks up throughout] [indistinct]

Hari-śauri: Yes it's recording. You can see its on number one. That's the end of it. That's the microphone. Say something, it is recording.

**Devotee:**
Hare Krishna!

**Prabhupāda:**
... If it is Ekādaśī [indistinct]

Devotee (2): Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
They can make [indistinct].

Devotee (2): Yeah right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Halavā.

Devotee (2): Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] says that he alone can feed 25 to 30 men.

Devotee (2): Ahh.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if you keep 2 then we can easily feed 50 to 60. Do you understand?

Devotee (2): Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
30 men, one. And 100 men, you choose..... [indistinct]..... means kachorīs, samosās, lugloo...

Devotee (2): Ah, pukka things, yes...

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] (lists preparations) nitai(?).....sev(?) dalmut(?) budiya(?), ladhoo... for Diety... [indistinct]...what you can get [indistinct] ...that is what is... [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhagatjī may go to Hyderabad. I am sending him.

**Akṣayānanda:**
That will be a great loss for me.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I said that you must be able to compensate yourself.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
You should know how, especially dealing with the municipality men. [break] For Rādhā-Mādhava?

**Mahākṣa:**
Something to do with Rādhā-Rāmaṇa Mandira in Vṛndāvana. I think one is Puruṣottama. Anyway, the first night we did a very nice program, //kīrtana,// and everyone was joining in dancing with us. We were dancing and they were all joining. And the second night they cancelled our program. We were trying to sell books in the front of the //paṇḍāl,// and they were giving us trouble for that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, they are envious.

**Mahākṣa:**
They are envious. Very envious.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why you joined them?

**Mahākṣa:**
I did not know. I thought it would be a good opportunity. They promised me they would give us a good program and good accommodation. When we got there, they did not like that we were very popular. [tape breaks up throughout] Then Mr. Bishop [indistinct] brother, T.C. [break] ...tour, he is a good man. He came with... [break] He is one of the most respected men in Bareilly. He forced them to put the program back again. So we did again the same evening. The people there love our program. They are all supposed... They have pictures of Caitanya Mahāprabhu on the stage and they're supposed to be following Him, but they sing all these //sahajiyā// sort of songs, and they sit down and it's all //gṛhasthas.// There's no... There's no real...

**Prabhupāda:**
They want business.

**Mahākṣa:**
Just a business. We also had a program with Dr. Gupta[?]. That was a nice program. And his wife, she cooked some Bengali //prasādam// for us. We took our lunch there. That was very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think that he is disciple of Tīrtha Mahārāja.

**Mahākṣa:**
Yes. But his son... His house, they have so many pictures of Ramakrishna and Sai Baba. His son is telling him to not follow the same like his father. And his father did not speak. He only spoke about three words. He's suffering from some rheumatism or something. Anyway, we had a good //kīrtana// there. [break] No, I never say, I never say.

**Akṣayānanda:**
But all the people who are Sai Baba followers, they all do have some activity in the mode of ignorance. They eat meat or onions. By their symptoms, we can see that they're in the mode of ignorance.

**Mahākṣa:**
...at Meerut by Mr. Brijmohan Gad. He has come. He's in our guesthouse now. Actually he just came here this morning. We stayed in his house. That was also a good... That is a good town also. Altogether we made fifteen Life Members in about two weeks. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...bring Hindi books.

**Caraṇāravindam:**
Yes, we need Hindi books. I met one man in Meerut, Hindi...

**Prabhupāda:**
Our //Bhagavad-gītā?//

**Mahākṣa:**
Yes. And he is the brother of, he said, I think the nephew of Kṣīrodakaśāyī dāsa adhikārī in London. His name is Mr. K. M. Gupta. I think he has taken initiation from you.

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't think... K. M. Gupta has given. Kṣīrodakaśāyī is my...

**Mahākṣa:**
Kṣīrodakaśāyī dāsa adhikārī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Caraṇāravindam:**
And he said that you have seen his one chapter of his translation and have approved it.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Mahākṣa:**
No, is that not true? I asked him for a copy, but he said that he only had one copy he was sending to London and one he was keeping for himself.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, he is translating.

**Mahākṣa:**
Yes. And he said if we wanted a copy we could send a man and he could copy it down. He's done the first three chapters.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nonsense.

**Akṣayānanda:**
What did he say his initiated name is?

**Prabhupāda:**
He is not initiated.

**Mahākṣa:**
The man who is translating is not initiated. His uncle, Kṣīrodakaśāyī dāsa.

**Akṣayānanda:**
How many your program up to?

**Mahākṣa:**
How many boys? Of our boys, we were seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
Indian, or...?

**Mahākṣa:**
There was one Indian boy, but he was very sick. We took him with us. He was very sick, so I sent him back here to Vṛndāvana. I took him because he had given one class in Hindi in the temple, and Mahārāja said that you had liked that. He was too sick. Physically and mentally sick.

**Akṣayānanda:**
He's okay now. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
No cloud. In the street it is very disturbing. [break] ...party, they are also touring? No.

**Mahākṣa:**
They have groups in different towns. They have in Birelli [Bareilly?] and Harpur. They don't travel and preach. I've met them in Ghaziabad also. They were the same. They were very envious, and they would not help. Also in Harpur they were the same. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Like our poison, [?] more. Mm?

**Mahākṣa:**
Oh, yes. The people are gullible. They do not know. They are more attracted to us. But we are not always there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Occasionally, you find cities. [break] You cannot speak Hindi, still they like? Huh?

**Mahākṣa:**
They like us.

**Prabhupāda:**
They like our //kīrtana.//

**Mahākṣa:**
Yes, //kīrtana// they like. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Seven person you took in a car?

**Mahākṣa:**
Some of the boys went in a bus. We had a bus also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bus?

**Mahākṣa:**
That belongs to Yaśodānandana Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bus... Why do you take the car?

**Mahākṣa:**
Well, the bus is not with me. My program is separate from the bus program.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that separate?

**Mahākṣa:**
Now the bus is gone to Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why you should take two cars? [break] Where you are staying?

**Mahākṣa:**
Some of us stayed in Anand Ashram. There is one //āśrama// there called Anand Ashram in the Civil Lines.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what is that //āśrama?// Anand Ashram?

**Mahākṣa:**
They have got deities of... They have got... In the main //bhavana// they have got Lord Śiva and Pārvatī in the center, big deities. And then they have got Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa at the side and Rāma and Sītā on the other side. They also told me to go. After some days they said we had to go. They did not like us. And we did not do anything wrong.

**Akṣayānanda:**
After how many days?

**Mahākṣa:**
After about one week.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Usually three days.

**Prabhupāda:**
They were feeding you?

**Mahākṣa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Why they did not like?

**Mahākṣa:**
It's difficult to say. I think it is envy. The //svāmī// who was there...

**Prabhupāda:**
He's a Māyāvādī.

**Mahākṣa:**
Yes, he's a Māyāvādī. He did not like it when the other people take an interest in us.

**Akṣayānanda:**
And they see that people are giving us money too. [Prabhupāda laughs] Actually, wherever we go, with a few exceptions, wherever we go, after the third day we just suddenly become unwelcome, even though we behave all right. The third day is about the limit.

**Mahākṣa:**
The one exception is this Gita Bhavan in Indore.

**Akṣayānanda:**
There are a few exceptions.

**Mahākṣa:**
They were nice to us there.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are nice. Once I had been there.

**Mahākṣa:**
Yes, they told me you had been there. That is why they are nice to us. Wherever you have been, there has been some change of heart. In Indore there is some definite effect from that. [indistinct] [end]
