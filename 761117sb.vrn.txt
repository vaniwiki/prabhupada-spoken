Translation: "Ṛṣabhadeva began to tour through cities, villages, mines, countrysides, valleys, gardens, military camps, cow pens, the homes of cowherd men, transient hotels, hills, forests and hermitages. Wherever He traveled, all bad elements surrounded Him, just as flies surround the body of an elephant coming from a forest. He was always being threatened, beaten, urinated upon and spat upon. Sometimes people threw stones, stool and dust at Him, and sometimes people passed foul air before Him. Thus people called Him many bad names and gave Him a great deal of trouble, but He did not care about this, for He understood that the body is simply meant for such an end. He was situated on the spiritual platform, and, being in His spiritual glory, He did not care for all these material insults. In other words, He completely understood that matter and spirit are separate, and He had no bodily conception. Thus, without being angry at anyone, He walked through the whole world alone."

**Prabhupāda:**
So //tatra tatra pura-grāmākara-kheṭa-vāṭa-kharvaṭa// and so on, so on. This is Sanskrit language. By combining words with the process of //sandhi// and //samasa,// one word can be as long as three miles. So for ordinary person it is very difficult to combine together. So it is for the learned scholars. But we must understand the purport. Ṛṣabhadeva is //parivrājakācārya.// This is called //parivrājakācārya.// We have heard this name, //parivrājakācārya. Sannyāsī's// third stage is //parivrājakācārya,// and the fourth stage is //paramahaṁsa. Kuṭīcaka, bahūdaka, parivrājakācārya// and then //paramahaṁsa.// So //avadhūta.// We have already understood, //avadhūta:// no conception, no bodily conception, completely. There is a song, //deha-smṛti nāhi yāra, saṁsāra kāhāṅ tāra.// If one is completely free from the bodily conception of life, as it is shown practically by Ṛṣabhadeva---people are spitting, calling him by ill names, and sometimes passing urine---he doesn't care. This is the example. //Āpani ācari prabhu jīveri śikhāya.// By imitation, it is not possible. We'll learn more and more about His body, how it was completely spiritual. //Na jāyate na mriyate va// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. In other place the spiritual body is //nainaṁ dahati pāvakaḥ// [[books:bg:2:23|[Bg. 2.23]]]. The... No weapon can cut it, no fire can burn it. These descriptions are there.

So what is that thing? It is definition by negation. We cannot understand in our present state what is that spirit soul, although we can perceive that there is something---in the absence of that something, this body is nothing but a lump of matter. That we get experience every day. But we cannot see what is that. Therefore atheist class or the persons with poor fund of knowledge, they deny the existence. They cannot see. But they cannot answer that "Why the body is no more working? What is that thing which is absent?" They have tried to explain in so many ways how that something... But they could not practically explain. We have to understand it by the //śruti// process, Vedic knowledge. That is real understanding. And understanding from the right person, Kṛṣṇa or His representative. And it has to be understood simply by hearing. There is no other process. You cannot see; it is so small particle. //Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya ca// [[books:cc:madhya:19:140|[Cc. Madhya 19.140]]]. So in these material eyes we cannot see even the spiritual spark within the body. How you can see the Supreme Spirit? It is not possible. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. These blunt senses cannot see. But we can perceive. This much concession is there, and one can become completely free from bodily conception of life. That is...

Here is the example by Ṛṣabhadeva. There are many. In the yogic process, //aṇimā-siddhi... Yogīs,// those who have attained some perfection in the //yoga// process, you can put him into locked room but he'll come out. That is called //aṇimā-siddhi.// Very small, the spirit soul, he'll come out. //Aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti, siddhi,// there are eight kinds of... He can do that. There was one //sannyāsī,// Trailinga Swami in Benares. He was sitting on the road naked. The police objected. So several times he was taken and put into the police custody, but he came out. Again he was sitting. This is //yoga-siddhi.// Then he was allowed---"Hopeless." They cannot be locked up. That is //yoga-siddhi,// not merely showing some gymnastic process. No. One must be... That //yoga-siddhi,// it is not possible in this age because people are not expert to practice this //yoga// system. Therefore Arjuna denied, "No, no, no. Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me to practice this //yoga// system. It is impossible for me." So five thousand years ago he said, "Impossible," but we are daring to make it possible. That is not very good. Better, as Kṛṣṇa says... To encourage Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa said that "Don't be discouraged because you cannot practice this //yoga// system. Here is the best process." What is that? //Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā// [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]: "If you simply think of Me, then you are the best //yogī.//"

So everything will be perfectly executed---//yoga, jñāna, karma,// and many other processes---if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the real purpose. If you come to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then everything is perfect. Even if you cannot execute //yoga, jñāna, karma// perfectly, still you are perfect. Still you are perfect. But the central point is that we must be absorbed always in thinking of Kṛṣṇa within the core of our heart. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]. Simply you should remain Kṛṣṇa conscious twenty-four hours, even in sleeping. That is the perfect stage. But we have to practice. It is not simply words. But it can be practiced; it is not impossible. The practice Kṛṣṇa is recommending, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]: "Always think of Me." Our, this temple worship... //Mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru.// And "Always think of Me." This class, this //kīrtana,// this //prasādam// distribution and offering obeisances, worshiping, so many---//śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]---take any one of them or all of them. Be perfect in that particular process. Try to become, at least. Kṛṣṇa will help you. //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. If you try your best, Kṛṣṇa will give you strength. Kṛṣṇa is always ready to help you, provided you want to take His help. He is ready. He has come to help you. Otherwise, what is the use of Kṛṣṇa's coming here and canvassing, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]? That is for our interest. You surrender to Kṛṣṇa or not surrender, it doesn't matter to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa does not depend on your service. He is completely perfect. He can create millions of servants like you in a moment. So why does He require your service? Why He should canvass for your service? His service is not suffering for want of you. But it is your interest to surrender to Him. It is your interest. This Kṛṣṇa wants to see, that you surrender to Him and become perfect and go back to home, back to Godhead. That is Kṛṣṇa's mission.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the same mission: to canvass,

> dante nidhāya tṛṇakaṁ padayor nipatya
> kāku-śatam kṛtvā cāhaṁ bravīmi
> he sādhavaḥ sakalam eva vihāya dūrād
> caitanya-candra-caraṇe kurutānurāgam
> [Caitanya-candrāmṛta 8.90]

This is our mission, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Why Prabodhananda Sarasvatī is requesting, //caitanya-candra-caraṇe kurutānurāgam:// "You just become inclined to serve the lotus feet of Caitanya"? Because He's Kṛṣṇa personally, and He has come to teach us how to approach Kṛṣṇa. That is Caitanya... //Kṛṣṇaya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-namne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, he understood. Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, he understood.

> vairāgya vidyā-nija-bhakti-yoga-
> śikṣārtham ekaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ
> śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-śarīra-dhārī
> kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye
> [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]

If we understand Kṛṣṇa through Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that "You become //guru.//" How? //Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. Don't change, don't alter. You simply try to preach what Kṛṣṇa has said. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction. If you follow this instruction... Don't make any addition and alteration of your so-called learned scholarship. That will not help you. You must present //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. //Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa.// There is everything, very easily done, provided we follow //paramparā// system.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should be pushed on very humbly.

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

//Kīrtanīya.// This preaching means //kīrtana,// not that simply with //mṛdaṅga// we can have musical //kīrtana.// No. Preaching is also //kīrtana. Abhavad vaiyāsaki-kīrtane// [[books:cc:madhya:22:136|[Cc. Madhya 22.136]]]: Vaiyāsaki, the son of Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, he simply described //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and became perfect. //Abhavad vaiyāsaki-kīrtane. Śrī-viṣṇu-śravaṇe parīkṣit// [[books:cc:madhya:22:136|[Cc. Madhya 22.136]]]: Parīkṣit Mahārāja simply listened; he became perfect. And Śukadeva Gosvāmī simply described. That is also //kīrtana.// So this is also //kīrtana.// As Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī teaching us, //he sādhavaḥ sakalam eva vihāya dūrād caitanya-candra-caraṇe kurutānurāgam// [Caitanya-candrāmṛta]: "You are //sādhu,// best person, noble, but this is my request." This is humbleness. If you say, "Oh, you are a //karmī,// you are a //mūḍha...//" Actually he's a //mūḍha,// but don't... In the beginning, if you say, then there will be no opportunity to speak. He is a //mūḍha,// that there is no... Working like hogs and dogs day and night for sense gratification, certainly he is //mūḍha, karmī.// Similarly, //jñānī,// they are simply speculating. That logic, //kākā-taliya nyāya:// "Whether the crow first of all sat down on the palm fruit, then the palm fruit fell down? Or the palm fruit fell down; therefore the crow could not sit on the palm fruit?" Logic. One //paṇḍita// said, "No, no. First of all, the palm fruit fell down, and the crow wanted to sit down on it, so he could not." Now another //paṇḍita// says, "No, no. The palm fruit was there, and because the crow sat down on it, it fell down." Now this is logic. They are wasting time speculating. //Kākā-taliya nyāya. Kupa-manduka-nyāya.// There are.

So that will also not help. They are presenting themself as big scholar. No. //Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.// Simply wasting time. Simply wasting time. They are so-called //jñānī,// but //māyayāpahṛta-jñānā//---there is no knowledge, //Vedānta.// Big, big Vedānti. Kṛṣṇa said, the supreme authority, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ vedānta-kṛt vedānta-vid ca aham// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. Now they do not care for Kṛṣṇa, and they are Vedānti. What kind of Vedānti? Nonsense. So this will not help. We have to preach... But if we say directly that "You are all //mūḍhas, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā// and //duṣkṛtina,//" they will be angry. Because //satyaṁ bruyad na bruyat satyam apriyam:// you have to speak the truth very cautiously; otherwise they will be angry. //Murkhayopadeṣo hi prokapāya na śāntaye:// "If you give good instruction to a rascal, he'll be angry." Therefore Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī is teaching us how we should present our case. //Dante nidhāya tṛṇakam:// "Sir, I have come to you, taking this grass in my teeth." This is a symbolic representation of becoming very humble in India. They take a grass. //Dante nidhāya padayor nipatya:// "And I am falling down on your feet." //Kāku-śataṁ kṛtvā:// "And I am flattering you: 'You are very grand,' 'You are very nice,' 'You are very learned,' 'You are...,' so on, so on." If you flatter, people become puffed-up. So, //dante nidhāya tṛṇakaṁ padayor nipatya kāku-śatam kṛtvā cāham:// "I have one submission." "What is that?" No... //He sādhavaḥ:// "You are a great learned //sādhu.// My one request is that whatever you have learned, please forget. Whatever nonsense you have learned, please forget. This is my submission." "I have learned so many things, and I have to forget? Then what I have to do?" //He sādhavaḥ sakalam eva vihāya dūrāt caitanya-candra-caraṇe kurutānurāgam:// "You just submit yourself to Caitanya-candra. Then everything will be perfect."

So our preaching is like that. //Śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu nityānanda. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥv// [SB 11.5.32]. This process is adopted not by rascals. //Su-medhasaḥ,// those who have got good brain, they will take it. So very simple thing, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu is approved by the //ācāryas,// by big, big scholars. So you have no fear of falling down. So take Caitanya Mahāprabhu's first mercy, and then preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You'll be successful. It is not possible nowadays to imitate Ṛṣabhadeva. Just like the Jains, they imitate that. What their imitation...? Not a single Jain up till now has become perfectly in the renounced order of life. So they say so. It was imitated by one king in the South India, and he is the originator, propounder of the Jainism. They say. But you cannot imitate Ṛṣabhadeva. That is not possible in this age. Better try to follow the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa. Your life will be perfect.

Thank you very much. [end]
