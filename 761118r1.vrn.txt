**Prabhupāda:**
And this paper should be carried to Pradyumna. [break] ...predicted it? They are not going to do all this protest against Transcendental Meditation.

**Hari-śauri:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means here they are feeling the weight. You see? These protests, this combination, this endeavor to collapse our..., that means they are feeling more weight. And what is this movement, Transcendent...? They never formed against any case, anything, Transcendental... They know that is farce. There are so many other groups: Yogi Bhajan, Transcendental Meditation and... What is he? Guru...?

**Hari-śauri:**
Guru Maharaji.

**Prabhupāda:**
Guru Maharaja. So many. Ramakrishna is not very prominent. Sai Baba. [aside:] Little, little, everyone. Who asked for them? Aurobindo. Even Aurobindo. Who will protest against Aurobindo? Aurobindo has got some influence in the Western...

**Jagadīśa:**
Not so much.

**Hari-śauri:**
I never heard of him before.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Hari-śauri:**
[laughs] I never heard of Aurobindo. If someone is interested in Eastern philosophy, generally they read books about Aurobindo and stuff like that, because up till now that's been the only literature that's been available in the West.

**Prabhupāda:**
Aurobindo?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. People like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
And now it is worthless.

**Hari-śauri:**
Now it's finished.

**Jagadīśa:**
There's one other movement, called the Moonies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Moonies.

**Jagadīśa:**
Moonies. That's been founded by Reverend Sun Myung Moon.

**Hari-śauri:**
That Korean man, that Korean businessman.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. But that is also not...

**Hari-śauri:**
They're big in the States. They're very big in the States.

**Jagadīśa:**
He wants to take over the world. He publicly says so. He claims to be organizing the world...

**Prabhupāda:**
That... [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
He says that Jesus never carried out what he intended to do...

**Prabhupāda:**
"I am doing."

**Hari-śauri:**
So he's going to come and do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that is capturing the sentiment. There is no philosophy. And who cares for Jesus? First of all they must care for Jesus. So he's... He has got any books?

**Jagadīśa:**
I don't think so. Maybe some pamphlets.

**Hari-śauri:**
No one's got any literature like yours. At the most, they can produce a few pamphlets. They can't even produce one volume the size of the //Bhāgavatam,// what to speak of eighty. And if they could, no one would read them anyway.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, on the whole there is now attempt to stop this movement.

[break] ...but in... We have made so many court cases. Now, only loss we are feeling now---in some airports they have stopped our book-selling. So formerly also they were stopped and again revived.

**Hari-śauri:**
Legally we haven't been stopped in any airport, I don't think.

**Prabhupāda:**
Legally we have been stopped?

**Jagadīśa:**
In Los Angeles, in Dallas and Atlanta.

**Prabhupāda:**
Legally?

**Hari-śauri:**
But that's only temporarily, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the...?

**Jagadīśa:**
It's a constant struggle.

**Prabhupāda:**
Struggle must be there. You cannot stop it.

**Jagadīśa:**
In Montreal for about two years...

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa since His birth struggled. [laughs]

**Jagadīśa:**
We had harassment from the police in Montreal for two years. Sometimes they even beat up the devotees. They have put them into jail...

**Prabhupāda:**
They have beaten even our book sellers in airports.

**Hari-śauri:**
Chicago.

**Jagadīśa:**
And the police mistreat the devotees. But still, the devotees continue, and now in Montreal there's no trouble.

**Prabhupāda:**
They crucified Jesus, what to speak of devotees. Prahlāda Mahārāja was persecuted. Haridāsa Ṭhākura. I think I shall not go to Europe, America, for some time. [laughter]

**Hari-śauri:**
Not unless this gets cleared up.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because it is being discussed about me. They say, "Old man is behind this movement."

**Hari-śauri:**
Even in Australia now they're having the same thing, kidnapping and everything. It's everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means they're feeling the weight. It is spreading.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. [end]
