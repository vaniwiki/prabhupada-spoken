**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

Translation: "When Lord Ṛṣabhadeva saw that the general populace was very antagonistic to His execution of mystic //yoga,// He accepted the behavior of a python in order to counteract their opposition. Thus He stayed in one place and lay down. While lying down, He ate and drank, and He passed stool and urine and rolled in it. Indeed, He smeared His whole body with His own stool and urine so that opposing elements might not come and disturb Him." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yarhi vāva sa bhagavān lokam imaṁ yogasyāddhā// [[books:sb:5:5:32|[SB 5.5.32]]]. So this is another process of //yoga-siddhi: ājagara-vṛtti, ājagara,// python, lying down in one place, eating and passing urine, stool, everything. //Ājagara-vṛtti. Ājagara,// the python, it lies down in one place, big, big python, sometimes covered by the earth, but still, he gets his food. Big, big animals enter into the home of the python. And the python can eat even a full horse, what to speak of other animals. But still, Kṛṣṇa supplies him food. He hasn't got to go anywhere. So sometimes, saintly persons, they sit down in one place. If Kṛṣṇa sends him food he will eat; otherwise he will starve. In our //ācārya-sampradāya,// Mādhavendra Purī, Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura, they were doing that. In Vṛndāvana, Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura, he was blind. He was sitting in one place, and Kṛṣṇa used to come and supply him milk.

So there is no anxiety for maintenance of the body. There is no anxiety. //Śāstra// therefore says that "Don't spoil your energy for the matter of maintenance of the body. That is already settled up." //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.// That is the Vedic injunction. //Nityo nityānāṁ, nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. The Supreme Lord is //nitya// as we are //nitya. Nitya// means there is no birth and death. //Na jāyate na mriyate vā, nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. This is our constitutional position. And what is the difference between the two //nityas?// One is plural number and the other is singular number. The singular number //nitya,// or Kṛṣṇa, He supplies food to everyone. Or whatever we require, that is already settled up. Therefore we should not spend our energy for maintenance of the body. That is not required. //Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad brahmatām upary adhaḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]]. Our human energy should be utilized only for that purpose which was not fulfilled in other lives, in the 8,400,000 different species of life, and you are changing, //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]], by nature's law, //prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. According to //guṇa// and //karma,// we are changing our body in 8,400,000's of species and forms. That is... By nature's law it is going on, and the nature's law, according to the body, one has to eat, sleep, and sense gratification and protection. At night we see so many dogs. The whole day they could not get food. At night they are crying. And there are other bodies; they are eating nicely. Even the small birds, they have got food. But this dog, they cannot get food. This is God's arrangement. They are condemned life. Otherwise, others are getting food; why this body is not getting food? The hogs, they are eating stool.

So varieties of life and varieties of position, you cannot change them. That is not possible. So the theory is humanitarianism, //daridra-nārāyaṇa-seva... Seva...// It is not //seva.// A poor man, you can have mercy, //dayā.// That is allowed. Just like we distribute //prasādam.// That is //bāliśeṣu. Īśvare tad-adhīneṣu bāliśeṣu dviṣatsu ca, prema-maitrī-kṛpa upekṣā// [SB 11.2.46]. //Kṛpā.// Those who are suffering, innocent, they do not know how to get release from the suffering, they are called //bāliśa.// Just like a child. A child is suffering, he does not know how to get relief; so one should take care. They should be given shelter, they should be given cloth, food. It is the duty of the parents. That is natural. So for the //bāliśa,// innocent, it is our duty to show them mercy, give them food, give them shelter, give them instruction of Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that he may understand why he is here in this material world, why he is suffering. //Ke āmi kene amaya jāre tāpa-traya// [[books:cc:madhya:20:102|[Cc. Madhya 20.102]]]. Everyone is suffering threefold miserable condition of life: //adhyātmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika.//

So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for showing mercy to the innocent who are suffering in this material world. That is wanted. It is not //daridra-nārāyaṇa seva,// that "I am very rich man. I am rich Nārāyaṇa, and therefore I can serve the //daridra-nārāyaṇa.//" There is no question of serving. That is not. No. The fact is everyone is suffering. There is nobody... Because //asad-grahāt. Sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]. Anyone within this material world, he is suffering, full of anxieties. Even the birds and beasts, you'll find, they are full of anxiety. Why? //Asad-grahāt.// Because he accepted this material body, which is //asat,// which is temporary. //Asato mā sad gamaḥ.// Therefore Vedic injunction is, "Don't stay in this material existence. Come to the spiritual existence, //sat.//" //Oṁ tat sat.// This is the civilization---not to keep the people in ignorance and flatter them that "You are making very good advance." There is no advance unless one is interested in spiritual life. There is no... //Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]]. In this way we are wandering within this universe in different forms of life, in different planets, in different social positions, in so many varieties.

So this is not our life. Our life is to regain our spiritual consciousness, revive our spiritual existence. And for this purpose we must endeavor. //Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovidaḥ. Kovidaḥ// means one who is intelligent. Otherwise, those who are not intelligent, they think that "I have got this life. I shall enjoy sense gratification," and "There is no life after death." Kṛṣṇa says, //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]], but these rascals will say, "No, there is no life." So therefore Kṛṣṇa has said, "//Mūḍhas,// rascals, they do not accept what I am speaking in this //Bhagavad-gītā.//" //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamaḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. They got the chance of understanding Kṛṣṇa, but they do not know. And the so-called rascal leaders, they are also misleading them, that "There was no Battle of Kurukṣetra. There was no instruction like that. It is all mythology, and we can utilize it for our political purposes, but it has no value. I can interpret in my own way; you can interpret in your own way. Actually, this instruction has no value." //Yato mata, tato patha.// "You can interpret in your own way; I can interpret..." In this way things are going on. This is the position.

Therefore our movement is being checked in the Western countries, that "This is a brainwash movement." Brainwash movement---that we are injecting some ideas by psychology, mental control, and our people, they are taking to it, and it is spreading like epidemic. How to check it? Therefore they are now taking action how to stop this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in Europe and America. They are trying. Of course, we are not afraid of this attempt. They will never be successful, rest assured, because we are pushing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa was attempted to be killed from the very beginning of His life. That is the nature of this material world, "How to kill God," "God is dead." This is their attempt. So from the life of Kṛṣṇa we can understand that so many attempts were made by the demons and the //rākṣasas// to kill Kṛṣṇa, but actually Kṛṣṇa killed them all. So if you are sincere, if you follow the principles and push on this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, nobody can kill you.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
You'll go forward, rest assured. We are not going to be killed. That they are perceiving, that this movement is spreading like epidemic, and the young men of Europe and America, they're taking seriously. Professor Stillson Judah already has given his conclusion that "This movement is not going to stop. It will go on." That's a fact. Kṛṣṇa cannot be killed, neither His movement cannot be killed. Rather, those who are attempting to kill, they will be killed. But we must be very sincere, serious, follow the regulative principle and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// as you have been taught. Follow this principle boldly, and there is no fear.

So Ṛṣabhadeva is Kṛṣṇa. So He became disturbed while walking on the street. He is not disturbed, but it is instruction that "If you are disturbed, you feel disturbed in this way, so you adopt this way. You sit down." Similarly, if they are disturbing too much, so we can sit down in one place and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. There is no difficulty. And Kṛṣṇa will send you all necessities. //Teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham// [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]]. He promises. Kṛṣṇa cannot say anything lie. He is perfect. So if there is actually impediments to push on this movement---people disturb too much---never mind. You sit down in one place and still go on preaching. //Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. People will come still in India. Why India? In your country also, if saintly person goes, they come. That is the practice in everywhere. So you can sit down and still preach. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. //Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa. Ei deśa// means where you are sitting, where you are living, any place. And sit down. //Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. And... But try to deliver these innocent persons who are suffering.

Everyone is suffering. That should be the motto. Do not sit idly, eat and sleep. No. Either loitering, wandering... I know our men in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are bold enough. They have sometimes been, I mean to say, beaten in the airport. But still, they are so straightforward, suffering from the police, from the public. And Ṛṣabhadeva was sometimes bitten on His body, urine, pass urine on His body, so much. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Ṛṣabhadeva. So He is teaching us that for the ultimate benefit of life you prepare yourself to suffer all kinds of tribulations. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given this instruction:

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā...
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

You should not give up your preaching work. //Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.//

If there are tribulations, as Ṛṣabhadeva, He is Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vaikuṇṭha, and He has no suffering. Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he was beaten in twenty-one bazaars regular with cane because he was Muhammadan, and in those days the Muhammadan kingdom was going on, Pathan ruling. So the Kazi, he saw that one Muhammadan, he has become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. So he called him so, that "With great fortune you became a Muhammadan, and now you are taking to Hinduism? You are so unfortunate?" So he could understand that "Here is a rascal. What I shall talk with him and argue with him?" He simply said, "Sir, it is... What is the fault there? Just like so many Hindus, they sometimes become Muhammadan, and suppose if I have become a Hindu, then what is the wrong there?" So the Kazi took it very seriously: "Oh, you are answering? All right. Order him that you beat this man in twenty-one..., cane, caning." So Haridāsa Ṭhākura was beaten in public market. The idea was that beating, he would die. But he did not die. Then the, I mean to say, men who were given in charge to beat him, they became afraid that "If this man is not dead, then the Kazi will take us very seriously that we have not beaten him seriously." So they began to flatter him, "Sir, unless you die, we'll be dead. Our life is in great danger." So Haridāsa Ṭhākura made a show of death, and he was brought before the Kazi that "Here, the body is dead."

So sometimes this kind of tribulation are there. Jesus Christ, what was his fault? He was preaching about God, or Kṛṣṇa. That was his fault, and he was crucified. So this is the world. This is the world. As soon as you become... This is //māyā's// arrangement. //Māyā,// as soon as she sees that "This man is going out of my hand," she will put so many tribulations, and we have to tolerate them.

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

But you cannot stop //kīrtana.// That is not possible.

So you should learn from the... //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]], learn from the //mahājana. Mahājana// means the devotees. //Mahājana. Mahājana// is also addressed in India to the //bāṇiyās,// means the mercantile class, //mahājana.// The //brāhmaṇa// is addressed as //paṇḍita,// and the //kṣatriya// is addressed as //ṭhākura,// and the //vaiśyas// are addressed as //mahājana,// and the //śūdras// are addressed as //chaudhuri.// This is Indian etiquette. So we are not talking of this //bāṇiyā mahājana. Mahājanas// are described in the //śāstra,// twelve //mahājana://

> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ
> prahlādo janako bhīṣmo
> balir vaiyāsakir vayam
> [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]

So they are twelve //mahājanas,// and we have to follow these //mahājanas.// The Ṛṣabhadeva is also //mahājana,// and the greatest //mahājana// is Kṛṣṇa. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. //Jana. Jana// means life, and //mahājana,// the supreme person. So //mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. Don't argue unnecessarily. //Tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā.// You cannot come to conclusion by this method or that method. Just try to follow. //Sādhu-mārga-anugamanam, ādau gurv-āśrayam sad-dharma-pṛcchā, sādhu-mārganugamanam// [Brs. 1.1.74]. We have to follow the footprints of great saintly persons, devotees, //mahājana.// Here is Ṛṣabhadeva. But in the Kali-yuga it is not possible to imitate //ājagara-vṛtti.// It is not possible, because we are already so weak. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. This is our position. We are very unfortunate. Every one of us, we are very bad, //mandāḥ,// bad habits. So it is not possible to imitate Ṛṣabhadeva or Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Don't imitate, but try to follow. //Anusaraṇa. Anukaraṇa// is not good. //Anukaraṇa// means false imitation. That is called //anukaraṇa.// And //anusaraṇa// means to follow. Try to follow as far as possible.

So we have got good opportunity to follow Caitanya Mahāprabhu. That is intelligence. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prayair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. There is no need of unnecessarily accepting tribulation, which is impossible in this age when we are so much disturbed. We are already dead, just like animals. Therefore it is a special concession:

> kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann
> hy asti eko mahān guṇaḥ
> kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya
> mukta-saṅgaḥ param...
> [SB 12.3.51]

Simply try to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// very sincerely, without any offense. Then... It is not possible to imitate or even follow Ṛṣabhadeva's process of self-realization. In the Kali-yuga it is not possible. But as it is recommended in the //śāstra,// as Ṛṣabhadeva in His another incarnation, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is teaching, //kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā. Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and you will get perfection.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda.
