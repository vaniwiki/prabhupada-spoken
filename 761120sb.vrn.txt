====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.5.33 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> tasya ha yaḥ purīṣa-surabhi-saugandhya-vāyus taṁ deśaṁ dāṣa-yojanaṁ samantāt surabhiṁ cakāra
> [[books:sb:5:5:33|[SB 5.5.33]]]

[break] [01:26]

Translation: "Because Lord Ṛṣabhadeva remained in that condition, the public did not disturb Him. But no bad aroma emanated from His stool and urine. Quite the contrary, His stool and urine were so aromatic that they filled eighty miles of the countryside with a pleasant fragrance."

**Prabhupāda:**

> tasya ha yaḥ purīṣa-surabhi-saugandhya-vāyus taṁ deśaṁ dāṣa-yojanaṁ samantāt surabhiṁ cakāra
> [[books:sb:5:5:33|[SB 5.5.33]]]

So here is incarnation of God, Ṛṣabhadeva. Now there are so many rascal incarnation. Is it possible to pass stool and make it //surabhi?// Is it possible? So you can ask these rascals incarnation that "Pass your stool here. Let us see first of all. Then we shall accept you." Practical. "We are fools and rascals. We want practical test." So //śāstra-cakṣuṣaḥ.// This is the injunction, //śāstra.// Here is //śāstra,// that the incarnation of God, even He passes stool, it is fragrant. He can do it. That is God. That practically you can see, that the cow dung... Cow dung, you can make a stack of cow dung here. It will never disturb you. You'll, rather, feel pleasure, passing through that portion of field where cow dung is stacked. You'll never feel any disturbance because it is pure. Cow dung---we have discussed this point many times---where it is impure, that it makes pure. In Indian villages, still they use cow dung for smearing over the floor, and it becomes very nice, fresh and purified. That is injunction of the //śāstra,// that cow dung is pure. So if by the will of Kṛṣṇa, by the arrangement of Kṛṣṇa, even an animal's stool can become so purified, what to speak of Kṛṣṇa's stool?

But //paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ.// They do not know it, what is transcendental body, //aprakṛta, sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], and what are the difference between this body and that body. //Muḍḥa,// they do not know. //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. Therefore they consider that "The Kṛṣṇa's body and my body is the same. If He has become God, so why shall not I become God?" But that is not possible. His body is transcendental; your body is not transcendental. Your body is this rotten earth, water, fire, //pañnca-bhautika.// You cannot compare with that. In this way, as it is stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,// His body is completely different from our body. //Aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti,// we sing every day in the morning. His body is so made that He can do everything and anything by any part of the body. There are many instances. Just like generally we find a person is born from the //yoni.// Therefore we call //sarva-yoni.// But Mahā-Viṣṇu or Garbhodakaśayī Viṣṇu, He did not take any help from His wife to give birth to a son, Lord Brahmā. He generated from His navel. This is called //aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti.// We have to see that. Where is that instance ordinarily that a child is born from the navel? But He can do that. A child is born from female. That is from the //yoni.// But here is, a living creature is born from the navel, and that is also //puruṣa.// So these things are there. And Kṛṣṇa, He exhibited, manifested, His //virāṭa-rūpa.// So He can do everything and anything, because His body is not this body. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. That is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.//

You cannot compare Kṛṣṇa's body with our body. If you do that, then you must be a //mūḍha,// rascal. Don't do that. Kṛṣṇa is always transcendental, //divyam. Janma karma ca me divyam// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. This //divya// you should understand. //Yo jānāti tattvataḥ.// He is liberated person. Anyone who knows what is Kṛṣṇa, immediately he becomes liberated. //Janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. It is not so easy to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth. It requires time. He... Not all of a sudden you can understand. But if you stick to devotional service, //sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [Brs. 1.2.234], then He reveals. When you engage your tongue... It is also wonderful. To understand Kṛṣṇa, you require your tongue. Generally we understand by seeing or by hearing. Hearing is there, but here it is recommended tongue, especially. Why tongue is used? Because if you simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa by your tongue and taste Kṛṣṇa //prasādam,// you will understand Kṛṣṇa. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ.// If you make it a promise, that "I shall not talk anything except Kṛṣṇa's message," and if you promise that "I shall not take anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa," these two things, this //prasādam// and chanting, will make you perfect to understand Kṛṣṇa.

In another place Kṛṣṇa says, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. This is //yoga, bhakti-yoga.// How easy it is. There are so many //yogas,// but if you practice //bhakti-yoga// you become first-class //yogī.//

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

So it is very easy, //bhakti-yoga.// It is not at all difficult. You haven't got to strain your body, as in other //haṭha-yoga// practice you have to very undergo hardship, to sit in a particular posture, in a particular place. These things are stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Not that you become //yogī// in a fashionable city, as you'll find nowadays, //yoga-āśrama,// signboard in a fashionable house, and you show some gymnastic, you become a //yogī// and get some money. Not that. This is //bhakti-yoga;// begins from //jihva.// Exercise your //jihva,// tongue; then you become a perfect //yogī.//

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayam samagram...
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

//Samagram.// Kṛṣṇa you'll understand fully, not partially. "Not partially" means not simply understanding impersonal Brahman. That is partial understanding. And then localized Paramātmā, that is also partial understanding. But when you understand Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person, that is full understanding. So you simply concentrate your mind unto the person of Kṛṣṇa, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ.// Here is Kṛṣṇa. We can see Kṛṣṇa. So if we simply concentrate our mind, meditation... //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. This was the practice done by Ambarīṣa Mahārāja.

So Durvāsā Muni, he was a great //yogī,// and he became very much envious, that "Here is a person who is a //gṛhastha// and a //kṣatriya,// he is not even a //brāhmaṇa,// and he does not practice anything. He is always engaged in his royal activities, and this man is so famous as a great person, great devotee. So I'll chastise him. I'll show." So he wanted to pick up some quarrel with Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, and on //dvādaśī// day he approached there with sixty thousand disciples, and he said, "Mahārāja, arrange for our //prasādam.// We..." "Yes, welcome." But his purpose was different. So he went to take bath in the Ganges and Yamunā, and then he came late. In the meantime he had to observe //dvādaśī-pāraṇa.// With the advice of the //brāhmaṇas// he took little water. The //brāhmaṇas// advised, "Mahārāja, water is food and no food. It has no actually food value. So your guest has not returned as yet. You can take little water and observe the completion of //dvādaśī.//" So he did it, and Durvāsā came very angry, that "I am your guest, and you have taken food?" That is not food; little water. So he wanted to chastise him. He created a big giant to kill the Mahārāja.

So immediately Kṛṣṇa's promise... //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. Immediately //sudarśana-cakra// came and killed that demon immediately, and then he pursued Durvāsā Muni. Durvāsā Muni first of all approached Lord Śiva because he was devotee of Śiva: "Please give me protection." He said, "Oh, it is not possible for me. If //sudarśana-cakra// is after you, I cannot do anything." Then similarly, he approached Brahmā. So he also said, "No, this is not possible." Then he was so powerful that he approached Lord Viṣṇu even, personally, in the Vaikuṇṭhaloka. He refused to help him. He said, "Durvāsā Muni, unless you beg pardon from Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, there is no question of excusing you. The //sudarśana-cakra// will not excuse." Therefore Vaiṣṇava //aparādha// is very, very offensive. You should be very careful. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has warned Vaiṣṇava //aparādha, hātī mata.// Vaiṣṇava //aparādha,// offense at the feet of Vaiṣṇava, is exactly like mad elephant. If a mad elephant enters your garden, then he spoils everything. This has been given. Vaiṣṇava //aparādha// means //hātī mātā. Mātā// means mad, and //hātī// means elephant. So we should be very, very careful not to commit any offense at the feet of Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava does not take any offense. He does not care who is offender, but Kṛṣṇa takes care. Kṛṣṇa will never tolerate if a person is Vaiṣṇava //aparādha.// Mind that. Just like a big man: you can offend him, he doesn't mind. But if he does something harmful to his child, so he becomes very angry.

Similarly, here also, Lord Viṣṇu... Just see how much powerful was Durvāsā Muni that he could cross over the material universe and go to the Vaikuṇṭha universe and see the Lord personally. How much powerful //yogī// he was, just you can... There is no such //yogī,// at least at the present moment. He could see. But he was refused by Lord Viṣṇu, and he came back to Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, and Ambarīṣa Mahārāja was standing without taking any food, that "This //brāhmaṇa// came at my place. Somehow or other, unnecessarily he became angry and he has left. So unless he comes back, I cannot take any food." So he took only one year. The modern scientists, they are estimating that to go to the topmost planet of this universe, it will take forty thousands of years. That is their estimation. Now, Durvāsā Muni, by his yogic power, he not only crossed over this material space and the material universe, but he went to the other space, //paravyoma,// where he saw Lord Viṣṇu, and he came back within a year. So that is //yoga.// One can reach even the sun planet by the beams. This is //yoga// practice. By touching the beams he can go to the sun planet. There are so many wonderful things.

So Durvāsā Muni was a great //yogī.// He knew all these things. Still, he was defeated before a Vaiṣṇava. He had to come and immediately fall down, "Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, kindly excuse me. I have done offense." Mahārāja Ambarīṣa was so humble, that "You are in trouble, //brāhmaṇa,// so whatever I have got, asset, whatever I have done austerity, penance and..., you take immediately and be excused." This is Vaiṣṇava: "You take all my asset." So there was very friendly. Then both of them took //prasādam,// and then Durvāsā Muni could understand what is the power of devotee. //Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ// [[books:bg:6:20-23|[Bg. 6.22]]]. So be very much careful to remain a spotless devotee. Then all success is there. There is no doubt about it. There are so many instances.

So this is transcendental body. It has nothing to compare with the material body. //Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa also says, //janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. So one has to know Kṛṣṇa. But that //tattvataḥ,// in truth to understand Kṛṣṇa, is very difficult job.

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

Not to understand superficially but to understand //tattvataḥ.// Then you are liberated immediately. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. One who has understood Kṛṣṇa //tattvataḥ,// he is immediately liberated person. He is fit for being transferred to the spiritual world. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti. Punar janma...// One who does not understand Kṛṣṇa, he will have to repeat birth after birth. //Nivartante mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]. Unless you understand Kṛṣṇa---//hariṁ vinā na mṛtiṁ taranti//---you cannot escape death, birth, death, old age and disease. It is not possible.

So if you want actually your life successful, you must try to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Then your life is successful. And to understand Kṛṣṇa, no other method will help you. Kṛṣṇa said, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. Never said that "I can be understood by yogic process or by //karma,// by //jñāna.//" The modern politicians, they stress on //karma// because they want to work hard like hogs and dog. They think //karma-yoga...// So //karma-yoga// is good, but //karmīs// are //mūḍhas.// Those who are simply working hard day and night for sense gratification, they are no better than the hogs and dogs. They are no good. But //karma-yoga// is different thing. //Karma-yoga// means one who has got attachment for producing something, working something. So Kṛṣṇa said that "Yes, you can do, but," //yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi yad aśnāsi yat tapasyasi kuruṣva tad mad-ar...// [[books:bg:9:27|[Bg. 9.27]]], "the result you must give to Me." //Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī// [[books:bg:6:1|[Bg. 6.1]]].

So anyone who does not take the result of his //karma,// then he is //sannyāsī.// Suppose you earn... You are a businessman, you have earned two //lakhs// of rupees---but give it to Kṛṣṇa. //Anāśritaḥ karma-phalam.// Otherwise, what you will do with these two //lakhs// of rupees? If you don't take it, will you throw it away? "No, why shall I throw it? It should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa." So let them... People are very much enthusiastic to earn money in this material world. We can see practically, especially in the Western world. But if they engage their profit for pushing on Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, then their money will no more be engaged in releasing atomic bomb. Otherwise it will be used for releasing atomic bomb. I shall break your head and you shall break my head. Both of them, we shall finish.

Thank you very much.
