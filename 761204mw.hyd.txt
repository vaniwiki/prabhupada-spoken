[someone chanting verses in Sanskrit]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [break]

**Haṁsadūta:**
...to Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Haṁsadūta:**
The roadway is always difficult. It's better if you travel by air. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They are dangerous road.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
The roads are not very good.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Tribhuvanātha is in Gujarat, is that right?

**Vāsughoṣa:**
Gujarat, right.

**Haṁsadūta:**
He's collecting to get the bus fixed. [break] Another one, a small one. [break] The day Your Divine Grace... [break] ...so much danger with these machines. Not a... [break] Motorcycle... [break] [indistinct fragments]

**Vāsughoṣa:**
It's very old. [break] Many Arabs are here in Hyderabad.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Indian man:**
They come here to get married. They marry local Muslims and go.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
They have so much money, but they only have a desert, so they have to come to India to try and enjoy. There's nothing to enjoy in Arabia, simply sand.

**Prabhupāda:**
Arabians come here, I know.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
In Bombay also, all the big hotels are filled with Arabians.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Devotee (1):**
This Taj and Oberoi, so many are there.

**Prabhupāda:**
India has good income from Arabian tourist.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
Yes. And they come back again and again to India.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Vāsughoṣa:**
Even in Bahrain I met the brother of the ruler, and he said that he liked India the best of any place he had been. He had been all over the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's a fact.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
He said India was the best place. So I told him to stay in our hotel in Juhu next time he came. [break] [end]
