**Mahāṁśa:**
...plant more trees, orchard for fruits and flowers, flower garden. So there will be plenty of flowers for the altar in Hyderabad every day and for the programs here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...walking road.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes. This road also, we want to extend it all the way to the end of the land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Mahāṁśa:**
The same road. That's where the dioramas will be. [break]

**Devotee (1):**
...having lunch with the cowherd boys on this rocky place and then people can come and sit here also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Later on. First of all grow vegetable. Let us eat first of all. Immediately grow vegetables sufficient. And this is good idea. We shall do that. But first of all let us organize the vegetables, fruits. What are these trees?

**Mahāṁśa:**
These are //nimbu// [lemon] trees which Badrukas have planted and were neglected, so they have become very stunted. We dug them out, and we put some cow dung just last..., two, three months back. We're going to bring them up, but they will not be very good now. They've already been stunted.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Mahāṁśa:**
They have been neglected in the beginning, so they have become stunted. So it will help a little by manuring, and some places it has to be grafted and cut off. Some of the trees are good. We get... How many //nimbus// did we get this year?

**Prabhupāda:**
Make //nimbu-ācāra// [lemon pickle].

**Mahāṁśa:**
Oh yes, we made... Acyuta-gaja isn't here. One devotee here, he knows how to make it. He made very nice //nimbu-ācāra.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply salt and lemon juice. Cut some pieces into half and soak it in lemon juice and put sufficient salt. In due course it will be very nice, thick. Very digestible. [break] Not yet utilized. So you have to do that. [break]

**Mahāṁśa:**
...a trench and a hedge, which has been planted here so that people and animals... Animals is the main problem. They come and they will eat up the plants which we grow. So by having this trench we avoid animals from getting in, and a hedge also. There'll be a lot of... One big problem that the Badrukas faced was that there was tremendous pilferage. These village people, they live on this land. They used to cut all the wood here for fire. They used to take whatever grows here, maize, and they used to steal in the night everything. Many times...

**Prabhupāda:**
So ask them to chant and take //prasādam.// They will be rectified. Make them friends, family members. Just we organize, everything is there.

**Devotee (2):**
Yesterday this truck came.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes, I told Prabhupāda. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is full of dust, and we have to believe this.

**Indian man:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see, a rascal scientist, "Full of dust."

**Jagad-guru:**
Their brains are full of dust.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They have never gone to the moon planet. Simply bluff. [break]

**Devotee (3):**
...this a reflection of the sun, or is it his own light?

**Prabhupāda:**
Own light.

**Devotee (3):**
Own light. It comes also from the living entities on the moon?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, there are fire, just like there is fire in the sun, but it is covered with ice. Therefore it is cooling.

**Devotee (2):**
You mean ice is covering the fire?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, surrounding, cold atmosphere. Something like... But it is fiery. And how they say that sun reflects some dust? Eh? How people believe it? [break] ...to be given in charge some plot of land to develop it.

**Mahāṁśa:**
One problem that could arise by giving them a fixed place, especially giving these labor people, if we give them a fixed place, then tomorrow they may... If they break the principles we may want to remove them.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you should change every month.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Change. Yes. Because the new phrases by the government is that "Tillers become owners." Whoever tills the land, he becomes...

**Prabhupāda:**
And this Society is the Society tillers, no individual person.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Society means some combination of some men.

**Devotee (4):**
These are very fantastic stones here. Especially this one stone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who explains how the stone came like this?

**Devotee (4):**
Yes, I think it's wonderful.

**Devotee (5):**
They will say from the formation of the mud. Mud accumulated over the years and became stone. Or vice versa.

**Devotee (4):**
This one stone is so big. It is just holding on a little stone. It is just in the air, like somebody's underneath and holding it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Cow dung can be collected. At least they can be used as cow dung. Here, you see.

**Devotee (6):**
In the small villages the women and children, they make the paddy for burning and cooking.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Mahāṁśa:**
This whole rocky area which we see here used to be like a natural dam, and the land on that side which is now our field used to be a big tank, so the soil there is very good. It's like silt. But then, afterwards, somebody had cut through this natural kind of a dam, and there's a canal that flows through here and goes into that tank over there.

**Prabhupāda:**
That canal is in our land?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes, it passes through our land. Plenty of water, and it goes and flows into that land, into that tank.

**Prabhupāda:**
So..., but you cannot use that?

**Mahāṁśa:**
That tank is not practical to use, to pump so far. But we can dam this again and make a little reservoir and let the excess flow. But they won't let us stop all the water because it will ruin their fields; but we can stop a part of the water for our field. We can get a good source reservoir of water over here.

**Hari-śauri:**
Tejiyas is getting breakfast ready, I think.

**Jagadīśa:**
Yeah, he has to cook.

**Devotee:**
You can see the canal from here. You can see [indistinct].

**Hari-śauri:**
Just down there at the base of that rock.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Devotee:**
Water from the canal.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is coming? You can go?

**Mahāṁśa:**
I think the ground becomes muddy.

**Jagadīśa:**
Go and check, Jagadānanda.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Mahāṁśa:**
It's not very good soil, but there is... Right around this rocky area there is this... Research people from the central government, they have brought out a grass called //dinanath,// "lord of the poor," and they say that you can put this grass in the monsoon time, put the seeds in, just plow it and put the seeds, and it's a very sturdy grass. It will grow for the whole year. And the cows can graze there.

**Prabhupāda:**
So do that.

**Mahāṁśa:**
So this whole area could be with that grass, and the cows can graze.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] Many temples for //kīrtana,// and around the temple let them live. Yes. All //viṣṇu-mūrti,// yes.

**Mahāṁśa:**
How many families should live around...

**Prabhupāda:**
As many possible.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Those who are attracted to that particular Deity.

**Prabhupāda:**
They will be attracted. If you follow this program they will be attracted, //prasādam// and chanting.

**Devotee (5):**
Especially people in this area, they are attracted to Bālajī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then?

**Devotee (5):**
They call "Govinda, Govinda," always.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then? They are already devotees.

**Devotee (5):**
They spend their whole year's savings to go to Tirupati.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now let them spend here for the temple.

**Mahāṁśa:**
And live here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They will be glad.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Then the Tirupati managers will become envious. [laughs]

**Devotee (4):**
How shall the worship be in the temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the small temples? What shall they worship?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you introduce //kīrtana.//

**Devotee (4):**
//Kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. And whatever they eat must be offered. That's all.

**Devotee (4):**
//Pañca-tattva// picture?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Yes, any //viṣṇu-tattva.// We have got in our, what is called, cover so many Viṣṇu names.

**Devotee (5):**
Yes, on the //Bhāgavatam.//

**Mahāṁśa:**
//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// all the different planets.

**Prabhupāda:**
They'll be glad to have //darśana:// "Here is Padmanābha; here is Mādhava; here is Govinda; here is Pradyumna," like that.

**Mahāṁśa:**
And then there must be one main temple over there, one major temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, every temple is... You can make a main temple there. They will be remembering Viṣṇu's name always. "Here is Padmanābha temple; here is Mādhava temple; here is Govinda temple," that's all.

**Devotee (5):**
When the cows goes on grazing, they'll go...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sa...// [Śikṣāṣṭaka 2]. Remembering the holy names of the Lord.

**Mahāṁśa:**
This stone is the boundary on this side.

**Prabhupāda:**
This stone.

**Mahāṁśa:**
This stone.

**Devotee (4):**
The tree's coming inside our land.

**Mahāṁśa:**
No, tree goes in. Other land is here. It goes all the way to that rock over there, Prabhupāda, that rock over there. And then this is the... We are almost at one corner of the land. And the land goes very far to that side.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who possesses that land?

**Mahāṁśa:**
This is all our land. This is the village people's land here. And then it goes from behind this tree, it goes all the way to the water. There's a little portion that juts out from here. It goes all the way to the water.

**Jagadīśa:**
Our land.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes, our land. We can go this way and...

**Devotee (4):**
Should ISKCON devotees live in each of these little villages?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes, surrounding the temple.

**Jagadīśa:**
They'll all be ISKCON devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Turn them all ISKCON devotees, even these villagers.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Give them neckbeads and //japa-mālā.//

**Devotee (5):**
For some particular religion, a small Hanumān temple here.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Hanumān?

**Devotee (5):**
Hanumān temple. Two hundred people used to come and dance yesterday night.

**Prabhupāda:**
They'll come today? No.

**Devotee (5):**
We went to the villages there to announce about our program.

**Devotee (4):**
Hampi. We were in Hampi, Karnataka State, and big rocks like this were there, and the people over the years constructed literally hundreds of small temples, some big. Some they cut directly into the rocks and then put in the //mūrti// there.

**Mahāṁśa:**
There is one Nṛsiṁha temple over here which is very unusual. It is inside of... There is a big rock, and it is right inside the rock, and if someone wants to have //darśana// he has to crawl inside to see it. The rock goes like this and he has to actually crawl in to see the Deity. Seems to be very, very old. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...on our?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes. This is all ours, all this.

**Devotee (4):**
The government is making propaganda for hard work, so they should come, and with hard work they can make nice temple from these rocks.

**Prabhupāda:**
You show the example. They will see. [break] ...like it, eh? These boys?

**Devotee (4):**
Oh, yes, very much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do you like it?

**Boy (1):**
Yes, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
You?

**Boy (2):**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Devotee:**
Not only the small boys. Some of the bigger boys, they also like.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is very nice. They'll live.

**Mahāṁśa:**
They surveyed this whole hundred acres around here, and they said anywhere in this hundred acres, you'll get water. You can dig and you can get water. This hundred acres has good underground water supply.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Mahāṁśa:**
And the land is very good, this soil here, this black soil, very good for cotton. It is called black cotton soil.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you grow. Cotton requires water?

**Mahāṁśa:**
It requires water. We have to have at least...

**Prabhupāda:**
Paddy and...

**Devotee (4):**
Not as much as paddy.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Not as much as paddy. And sugarcane can grow very well on this also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Immediately grow sugarcane.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because the upper portion of the sugarcane will be fodder for the cows. [break]

**Devotee:**
...take great care in what they feed their cows. Even though the grasses may be good, they grow alfalfa. They make a special feed for them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm, they take care because they want to eat.

**Mahāṁśa:**
So the whole taking care is for their own stomach.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, for cutting the throat, that's all. There is a Bengali word, //toma ya bhalo asa mussulmanera muragī pusa//[?]: "Your love is like tending the roast [roost?] by the Muhammadans." What is called? Roast? They keep...

**Haṁsadūta:**
"Like a Muhammadan loves his chicken."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So long it is taken very much care, and then, when it is fatty, cut throat. In this material world the love is like that: for one's own interest, not for the lover's interest.

**Hari-śauri:**
Not love, lust.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm, yes, it is lust.

**Devotee (5):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, there are many of these great trees, but the government takes it over. They take dead grass and make liquor out of that. No one is allowed to cut them.

**Mahāṁśa:**
We can get permission.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we can use for our own purpose.

**Devotee (5):**
Can we drink date //rāsa?// We are allowed to drink date //rāsa?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Date //rāsa?// Oh, yes. Why not? Very good.

**Mahāṁśa:**
This thing?

**Prabhupāda:**
Date //rāsa.// That is good.

**Mahāṁśa:**
//Nira.// This is not date like Māyāpur. This is a different kind of tree. They make toddy out of this.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that date //rāsa,// if you keep, it becomes toddy.

**Mahāṁśa:**
So early morning that is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Mahāṁśa:**
...good to take. [break] Hare Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So we can do it tomorrow.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes. //Kīrtana.//

**Prabhupāda:**

> udilo aruṇa pūraba-bhāge
> dwija-maṇi gorā amani jāge
> bhakata-samūha loiyā sāthe
> gelā nagara-brāje

This is //nagara-brāje,// walking. Everywhere it will be victorious. [Hindi]

**Devotee (7):**
Fifteen rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fifteen rupees?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Kilo or whole?

**Devotee (7):**
Whole thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Devotee (7):**
Ten kg.'s. Ten kg.'s altogether.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ten kg.

**Devotee (7):**
Approximately he is selling ten kg.'s.

**Devotee:**
1.50 a kilo.

**Mahāṁśa:**
It's high priced.

**Prabhupāda:**
Higher... [Hindi conversation over price; vendor is going to sell in Hyderabad] //Pañca-rūpya,// you can take?

**Devotee (7):**
I told him but he said, "I will better go there and sell it."

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Devotee (7):**
He will walk all the way there.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. He can go. [Hindi]

**Boy devotee:**
Is the sun-god an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone is incarnation. You are also. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. You have not read //Bhagavad-gītā?// Any living entity is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Just like this child is the part and parcel of his father, you are part and parcel of your father, similarly, every one of us, we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa.

**Boy devotee:**
Is the sun-god an //avatāra?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Any god or dog, anyone is part and parcel. This is our land? No.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes. It goes all... That's a village. That... Those trees there is the village.

**Devotee:**
Those date trees are on our land?

**Mahāṁśa:**
You see the big trees? That is the border. Yes, all the way to the village our land goes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[referring to vendor] Man gone?

**Mahāṁśa:**
He went that side.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the market price?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Of those vegetables?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Mahāṁśa:**
To be about a rupee a kilo.

**Prabhupāda:**
So how many kilos it is?

**Mahāṁśa:**
He says there's ten kilos.

**Haṁsadūta:**
We should have bought it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Haṁsadūta:**
We should have bought, because when we go we have to spend money for gas, five rupees.

**Devotee (4):**
Of course, paying a Hyderabad price.

**Devotee (7):**
He is going there.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Mahāṁśa:**
You want him to come, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, if you offer him little more, if you pay...

**Mahāṁśa:**
Ten rupees less.

**Haṁsadūta:**
He said for ten rupees he will sell it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not less than that?

**Hari-śauri:**
We might get it for seven or eight. We said five, he said ten. We used to get it for [indistinct].

**Mahāṁśa:**
Now he'll come all the way here.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's going?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Is he coming?

**Devotee (7):**
He's coming.

**Devotee (4):**
Should we have a marketplace, Śrīla Prabhupāda, where they come to bring their produce?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (4):**
And they can exchange, barter.

**Farmer vendor:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Six rupees? [Hindi exchange with vendor and devotees] Eh?

**Devotee (8):**
He's saying thirteen rupees.

**Devotees:**
[laughter] Oh!

**Prabhupāda:**
Tell seven rupees.

**Hari-śauri:**
Seven. Tell him seven. [Hindi] He's going.

**Prabhupāda:**
Seven?

**Devotee (2):**
He agreed for ten rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
So do you think we shall take?

**Devotee:**
Yes, so much petrol and...

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, ask him.

**Devotee (7):**
[Hindi---calling vendor back] [laughter]

**Hari-śauri:**
When he gets here tell him eight.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Tell nine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Charge him nine.

**Devotee:**
He must give the basket also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He has good basket. Give him ten rupees.

**Hari-śauri:**
With the basket give him ten.

**Indians:**
[Hindi exchange]

**Prabhupāda:**
So how far our temple it is?

**Hari-śauri:**
Just after the trees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. All right. This //brinjal// and this //jhiṅgā// will make very nice vegetable. Simply I'll show you how to do it. You'll like it.

**Devotee (4):**
In the new //Back to Godhead// the devotees in Florida, they have got one farm, and they are calling "New Naimiṣāraṇya."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Devotee (4):**
They are calling, yes, "New Naimiṣāraṇya," and we are also calling "New Naimiṣāraṇya."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Devotee (4):**
It's all right?

**Devotee (3):**
We were planning to have our temple site located here at this corner of the land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That's nice. Flat land? This is flat land?

**Devotee (3):**
Yes.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Right there. We didn't want to put it this side because then people would come into the living area, so we put it right on the road, on this side, with a //prasādam// hall.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. [break]

**Devotee (4):**
...some pottery made here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Devotee (4):**
The devotees staying here, living here, they may make some pottery, set of potter's wheel, make clay pots.

**Prabhupāda:**
What? What you'll use, pots? Here pottery is very cheap. We are not for arts. We are simply bare necessities of life and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotee (7):**
Tirupati, they have these Veṅkateshpuram [indistinct] and blowing on the loudspeaker every day. One... You can hear for miles. So we can also do some Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// chanting?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
They do that in Māyāpur.

**Mahāṁśa:**
We can have a //maṅgala-ārati// in mikes. We can use a microphone for //maṅgala-ārati.// [break] [end]
