</audio>

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I have questions from the artists.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Questions from the artists. This is for Ninth Canto, Volume One. This is Mahārāja Ambarīṣa performing //abhiṣeka// on the altar. Muralīdhara will be painting this. And he has these musicians in the foreground. They will be off in a little bit of shaded area, and he wants to know if that’s appropriate to have them like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. It is all right.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
In front of the Deities. //Jaya.// There are some other things. Is it all right now? I have Sanskrit questions, but I think I can give those to Pradyumna. It is for Ninth Canto. This is some question from Baradrāj, about, erm... He has questions and also a letter. Shall I read you the letter?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm-hm.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
[reading] "Dear Śrīla Prabhupāda, Please accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet. Having received your divine order dated September 18, 1976, indirectly from Rāmeśvara Mahārāja, I have taken it as my life and soul. The order was to finish this theistic exhibit before the Māyāpur festival. This will be done, because I understand that with every order of the spiritual master the disciple also receives the blessing to carry it out. I am the most unqualified to do it, but I am hoping that you will bless me so that I can please you. There is a lot of hard work involved, and much detail to attend to, so all your sons and daughters who are involved in this project are working with great dedication and sacrifice. Seeing their enthusiasm I am gladdened, and I understand that Kṛṣṇa is giving His sanction. I am herewith sending an excerpt from the narrative which will accompany the exhibit of Your Divine Grace writing in the Rādhā-Dāmodara Temple. I would like to beg Your Divine Grace to recite onto a tape the passage encircled." He’s... That's over here. We have got a better tape recorder to do it with than this one. It is a short thing. Hari-śauri [indistinct]. "We also request that you kindly write those words down on a sheet of white paper. The passage was taken from your Introduction to //Bhagavad-gītā.//" Remember the //mūrti// that you saw when you were in Los Angeles of you writing?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Well, they want to get... They want you to say the verse as much as possible, and that will be part of the soundtrack for the exhibit; it will be you thinking. And they want you, if possible, to write all of it or some of it in your handwriting, so that the //mūrti// can actually be there with the pen, and the writing will be there. "I am offering prayers to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva that ill health will not burden Your Divine Grace. I am longing to have the //darśana// of your lotus feet. Please excuse me for my offenses. Your humble servant and son, Baradrāj dāsa." Then a short statement about the deities for the Fiji temple. He says that it won’t be possible to cast them all before February because of the exhibit. We’ll try to finish it before Māyāpura. So the actual small-scale models are already done. They are complete. And the large modeling for the casting will be done by March, and the actual finished deities will be done by the end of April. And the other deities besides Kāliya Kṛṣṇa, Guru-Gaurāṅga, the Nāgapatnīs, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Lalitā-Viśākhā will be done by the end of March. So Baradrāj says that he is sorry that he can’t finish by February, but he thinks that even if it is sent off to Jaipur, they won’t finish by the end of...

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
So he should go on with his plan to finish by April. Approved?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
And Rameśvara has sent three thousand dollars cash donation for Kumbha-melā food distribution.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Oh.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I will be bringing that to Gargamuni. That is a donation from Los Angeles temple. And there are some initiation letters and other letters. I will give them to Jagadīśa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Jagadīśa has not come?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I don’t think so.

**Girirāja:**
He was here about a half hour ago. Maybe he has come back.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Pradyumna too?

**Girirāja:**
Yes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
There are a lot of things from Rāmeśvara Mahārāja. What shall I do? This is an article about [indistinct], a famous //Gītā// scholar revealed as homosexual, big Māyāvādī homosexual.

**Girirāja:**
I heard you read it last night. I heard it before.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, what is the purport? Read it.

**Devotee:**
He is a very famous //Gītā// scholar. Now it is revealed in //Time// magazine that he is homosexual. He gives a Māyāvādī commentary. He really thinks everything is one.

**Girirāja:**
He is //advaita//---no duality between man and woman.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Here is the donation from Rūpānuga and Ātreya Ṛṣi. This is Rūpānuga and that's Ātreya Ṛṣi. And this is...

**Prabhupāda:**
One thousand, one hundred twenty-five?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes. One thousand... And that’s the rent for December.

**Prabhupāda:**
What did he send?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Deposit in the account. This the Bombay transfer.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with guest] //Guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]].

**Guest:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
So what is that?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
So this is the November BBT report to the temples. This is the testimonies from the parents of the devotees. This is the BBT Trustees’ report for October and November.

**Prabhupāda:**
Parents.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Parents first?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
These are all parents of just the Los Angeles devotees, just one temple. "I am glad my son has chosen religion over so many undesirable paths. It is sad that this harassment is going on. Some people are just cruel by nature. I have to admire these young people for the daily sacrifice they are making in their welfare work. I know from first-hand experience that these accusations against the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement indoctrinating its members and infringing upon their free will are false and insubstantial. I am totally against these parents infringing upon the rights of their daughter, seeing that she is of legal age and should be allowed to live her own life. Virginia T. Nino[?], parent." "I believe that the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement has helped my son, and it has had a very good effect on him in respect to his becoming a useful American citizen. He is also a very devoted son to me. I also am in contact with other devotee parents, and I know that they feel exactly as I do. Mrs. Estelle Blummert." That is Madhusūdana’s mother. "I think that the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement has helped you and brought you away from some of the bad things that you were involved in before." This is directly to her son. "It has helped you to become more respectful to your parents and other people. I think that has helped influence your sisters to get away from their harmful views on drugs and things like that. I do feel that if you are happy, that is all you need, because when you die you will be with God. Mrs. V. Balawajda[?], former Catholic religious teacher and parent of a devotee." "I think there is certainly no harm in Kevin participating in the Hare Kṛṣṇa religion. If it will fulfill his life, then he must be allowed to live happily. Dwayne and Nancy Yee." They are the parents of Rāmadāsa Abhirāma dāsa. He is that artist, working for the BBT. "We have always tried to encourage our son into taking up a religious life.

Our plans were for him to become a Catholic priest, but he has chosen this. We can see that his life in the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is so nice. We like the principles that this Society stands for. We have only wanted the best for our son, and now we can see that he has it, and we both feel that our prayers have been answered. Mr. and Mrs. John Avery." "We are thankful that our son has joined the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. We both think all the devotees are very nice godly people. Mr. and Mrs. I. J. Bitner." That is Rāmeṣṭa, who is in the Sanskrit department, BBT. "I have two lovely children and three grandchildren in this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, and I am proud of it. They have never been in trouble with drugs or the police, and they live plain and peaceful lives, and they give me very much happiness every time I see them. If my husband and I were younger and not so set in our ways, we would proudly have joined such a movement. Thank you A. C. Bhaktivedanta." [laughter] "Julius and Shirley Killman."

**Girirāja:**
Wow.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] "Swamījī, it is our great fortune that you have come." Even the Christian priest, they also come to thank me.

**Lady guest:**
Yes, one of them was [indistinct] teacher...

**Girirāja:**
Yes, religion teacher.

**Lady guest:**
Yes, that was religion teacher.

**Prabhupāda:**
When I was sick [Hindi].

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Remember in Los Angeles that priest came, and he shaved up?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Remember that priest talked to you in the garden? He shaved his head the next morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Twenty-eight years' priest.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is still with us?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I'm not sure. I haven’t seen him. Maybe he went to another temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He went with me to Toronto.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Oh, so that's why I haven’t seen him.

**Prabhupāda:**
And that picture in Germany, one priest. Germany? Book?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Oh, yeah. It’s in //Back to Godhead?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Some book. Just see how [indistinct] is fallen.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
[reading more testimonials] "Swami Bhaktivedanta Prabhupāda is offering a productive life of knowledge and happiness in serving God and mankind. Enlightened men of America are beginning to appreciate his work, and I only regret that my fine daughter and son-in-law have been able to embrace this life more fully than I. Mr. Lionel Weiser." "I fully support my son’s participation with Hare Kṛṣṇa. I think it has helped him. I am happy for him and his wife and child. I think that this movement is greatly misunderstood. It should be supported. I have come to many Hare Kṛṣṇa services. Mrs. Catherine San Fillibio." "I am grateful to Kṛṣṇa consciousness for straightening my daughter’s life and giving me peace and her peace and bringing us closer together. Mrs. Delores Servi." "From my view he has apparently adjusted to enjoying a way of life which is giving him happiness, which is all I ever wish for any of my children. Raymond Grant." That’s Rāmeśvara’s father. "We think it is very good. It is really fantastic. I agree with everything the devotees are doing and how they live. Mr. and Mrs. Pius[?] Seltzer." One devotee, Mahendra, his father was not so favorable, but then when he came to Los Angeles he saw that Mahendra had a bigger office than he did, so he became favorable. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hayagrīva’s father and mother came? His father and mother came.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They came in India. Father was little...

**Girirāja:**
Upset.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Inclined to take him back. When I presented, I, "Take your son here," but he declined, and she began to cry. [laughter] "Take your son. Here is your son. Take your son." Father and mother, especially mother, they suffer. And unless mother is good, the son cannot be good. Our Mahāṁśa, he is coming from Parsi family. So in the beginning his mother came to fight with me---not fighting---but now she is very happy. Sudhāmā returned; his mother said, "You have come to here? Immediately go again." Just see. After all, mother wants actual happiness of the son. He is seeing, "Yes, my son is very happy there." Hari-śauri's father and mother came. [break] [indistinct conversation between devotees about tape recorder]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
So do you want me to read them? Reports?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

[Tape speeds up]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
"BBT Trustees’ report for the month of November 1976. Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. Enclosed please find the English BBT monthly divisional report, accounts receivable report..."

**Prabhupāda:**
You are bringing the bank account, the debit of these vouchers?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes. You want to first see this, see the bank account? Opening bank balance at Sanwa Bank was 38,000. That’s the Press. Then Security Pacific was 1,025. Over at the Union Bank 117,697. Then we had petty cash, which was small amount. So... Book sales---$359,382. Interest, $4,101. Loan payments, $25,824...

**Prabhupāda:**
This is collection?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes. Yes. This is all income. [break]

[Tape speed back to normal] [indistinct] [break]

Do you want to hear Rāmeśvara’s newsletter? This is the book distribution. First place Rādhā-Dāmodara, as usual. And second place, Los Angeles. Third place, Germany. Fourth...

**Prabhupāda:**
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa you cannot beat.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has some magic power.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
One thing is interesting though...

**Prabhupāda:**
In the very beginning, practically largest printing was done, inspired by Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. When I was in San Francisco, I saw that this boy was selling, so I talked with him. Then I first attempted //Back to Godhead// from five thousand to twenty thousand, Japanese. So I saw that he was selling more---1967.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Sixty-seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
He was selling more. So that inspired me.

[someone gives Prabhupāda flowers or garland]

[aside:] You can take it from [indistinct]. Thank you. It is so nice.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
You can smell it all the way across the room.

**Prabhupāda:**
Night Queen, eh? Night Queen, it is called?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I don’t know. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca// [[books:bg:7:9|[Bg. 7.9]]]. This is Kṛṣṇa, this smell. Who can manufacture this smell? I think I have given one article in //Kṛṣṇa.// No? Where I have given it? "Kṛṣṇa is wonderful."

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
"Wonderful Kṛṣṇa"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
It’s in //Kṛṣṇa// book.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kṛṣṇa// book. [to Hari-śauri] You can divide...

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
You want the rest of the book scores?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Hari-śauri:**
What else is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, nothing. You can take this, divide this.

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
We can split it up later. I am doing all the reading. So it’s Rādhā-Dāmodara, Los Angeles, Germany, then Berkeley.

**Prabhupāda:**
Germany is third?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes. Germany, third.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is being done by...?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Just one temple. Just the German temple. Jayatīrtha Prabhu was there. There are these two men that come in first place in the entire movement for big book distribution every month.

**Prabhupāda:**
The third German business is finished. [laughter] Kṛṣṇa says, "No, no, it is increased." [laughter]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
So then Berkeley, then Australia traveling //saṅkīrtana...//

**Prabhupāda:**
If we win the case, then we [indistinct] entrapment[?]. Most probably settle the case.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
In Germany.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. England, it is doing very nice.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I was just there. It’s a very nice temple. The devotees there have a nice attitude toward one another. No fighting; very friendly and co-operative.

**Prabhupāda:**
Jayatīrtha is there.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
No party-ism?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
No. They are also distributing a lot of books.

**Prabhupāda:**
There was party-ism during our Haṁsadūta’s time. [laughs] He himself becomes the party. [laughter]. Controlling party-ism. He himself becomes the party.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
They do a lot of book distribution there now. Dānāvīra is there. He is the man that makes so many new devotees, and he says it's the best field he's ever seen.

**Prabhupāda:**
In England?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Oh, yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
Haṁsadūta said that. Englishmen, they join more easily than anywhere else. Very receptive.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
This boy Dānāvīra says that the hippies in England are just like they were in America in 1968, when so many devotees started joining in America. He says that he thinks that if they work very hard they can start the same thing in England with just thousands joining, he thinks. He is very enthusiastic to make a lot of men there.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are simple-hearted than the Americans, Englishmen?

**Hari-śauri:**
They are very simple-hearted.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
They are more polite.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have very big culture there. I have seen the higher class, lord family, and [indistinct] elegant. Aristocracy, the British has introduced in India. Aristocracy. Before that, the Muhammadans, Nawabs, they were also very affluent. And we Indians, we learnt from the Muslims and the Englishmen. Otherwise India was not... What is called? Popiss?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Pompous? Extravagant?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. They are not like that. The Muslims and the Britishers... The Britishers, they are educated to very aristocratic in India, just to know the respect, govern generation. Otherwise how they could rule? They knew that any moment they can drive away. Two hundred, three hundred Englishmen, and sixty million...

**Hari-śauri:**
Six hundred million.

**Prabhupāda:**
Six hundred millions rule over. Is that easy done? Any moment... [laughs] [laughter] They knew it. Now we shall unite all nations in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is only possibility.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
You want to hear the further scores?

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s all right.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I will leave all of this with Hari-śauri.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I have got separate files. So we can go earlier to the bed.

**Hari-śauri:**
You want to go now? It’s five to nine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Hari-śauri:**
You want to go..., would you like to go now?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [end]
