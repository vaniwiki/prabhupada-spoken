**Prabhupāda:**
...they will not walk on the street. This was the system.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
You would never see them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
You would never see them at all.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is...

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
You want lunch? Do you want some lunch, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
If woman walks on the street then [s]he is not respectable. Now women are going to offices.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now they are doing everything, even leading nations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nation is also doing that.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In President Carter's new cabinet he included a woman as a secretary now, as a minister, for the first time, I think.

**Hari-śauri:**
In England also they have a woman Prime Minister for the first time.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
She's a leader of the opposition.

**Hari-śauri:**
No, she was the Prime Minister as well. She's the opposition now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Woman is acting as police in England.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
In Los Angeles there was this one man at the temple that we suspected that he had a gun. So we called the police. It is a difficult job for police when someone has a gun. They always send the best men. So a car pulled up and a woman got out, and she crept up on the man to arrest him, and the men stayed in the car.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything is becoming a farce. [break] What is that?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These are just some letters I'm sending with Rādhā-vallabha to Los Angeles.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
When we reprint the //Kṛṣṇa// book trilogy this year, the hardbound, I was wondering, could we put more pictures in the second and third volumes? Not changing, but additional.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why increase cost?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
I don't think it would be that much. The first volume has over sixty pictures, and the second one only has thirty-two and the third only has twenty-four. It will incr... Anything we do will increase the cost, but not so significant. Few cents. We were thinking that the //Kṛṣṇa// books were originally printed many, many years ago, and since then we have a lot of nice paintings of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes that we could put in.

**Prabhupāda:**
If you can give without increasing price, there is no harm. Or for this cents. Let us.

**Jagadīśa:**
//Prasādam// is ready.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
If it's only an insignificant increase then we'll put some in.

**Prabhupāda:**
But you don't increase price.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Oh, to the temples.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, to the customer.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes. That's no problem.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Prasāda// ready?

**Pālikā:**
Yes. [end]
