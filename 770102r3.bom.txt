**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Trivikrama Mahārāja?

**Hari-śauri:**
I think he's rather keen on working in Southeast Asia still.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He spoke to me this morning. He has to go back for some time to Southeast Asia, but he's willing to stay in India and travel between centers. He's a very nice //sannyāsī,// and I think it would be a very good idea.

**Prabhupāda:**
Call him.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He is giving a class right now. But he cannot go... He told me that he has to go to Southeast Asia first because he has books and everything.

**Hari-śauri:**
He has two men there still. There's two men there still, and they have about two and a half thousand books still to distribute. He said one of the reasons he wanted to come was 'cause there's no center in Hong Kong... [end]
