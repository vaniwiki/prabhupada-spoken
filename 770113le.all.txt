**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] ...the Personality of Godhead, He has come down. He comes,

> yadā yadā hi dharmasya
> glānir bhavati bhārata
> [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]

That is one of the pastimes: to deliver the fallen souls. Fallen souls means anyone who is in this material world, beginning from Brahmā down to the small ant, all of them are fallen. It is simply degree of position. Just like in the prison house everyone is a criminal. One may be first-class prisoner and one may be third-class prisoner, but all of them are prisoners. Similarly, in this material world, anyone. There are millions in different positions, but none of them are liberated; they’re all conditioned. Kṛṣṇa has given them different positions according to their desire. Kṛṣṇa can fulfill everyone’s desire. There is no difficulty for Him. If someone wanted to become Brahmā, Kṛṣṇa can fulfill his desire.

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

So Kṛṣṇa is giving everyone facility. Whatever he wants, //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]], but //mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām:// "But if you desire, you can come to Me, back to home, back to..." That facility is also there. So when Kṛṣṇa comes personally or Caitanya Mahāprabhu comes, He advises that "Come back to home. Why you are fallen?"

> ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokān
> punar āvartino 'rjuna
> [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]

To remain conditioned under the laws of nature, that is not good life. That is not good, either you become a Brahmā or Lord Indra or Chandra or a big minister, big president, just [indistinct]. That is Kṛṣṇa’s advice, Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s: finish this business. //Sarva-guhyatamaṁ.// This is the most confidential knowledge. Finish this business of material existence, either as Brahmā or... That is the verdict of all Vedic //śāstras.// They do not know what is there, the conditioned souls; they do not know what is real self-interest. Everyone will say that "I have got some self-interest." That’s very good. Everyone should be self-interested. One should be interested in his own self and the goal of life. That is very intelligent. But they do not know what is self, that is the problem. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. //Svārtha-gatiṁ,// real life, is to go back to Visnu, //tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayo// [Ṛg Veda 1.2.22.20]. Those who are //sūrayaḥ//---not //asūrayaḥ---sūrayaḥ,// learned demigods, learned persons, they are aiming how to go back to home, back to Godhead. That is //param padaṁ, tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā.// This is Vedic //mantra.// They’re trying to be happy by material adjustments, //durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ. Bahir-artha,// external. This material world means creation of the external energy. So they have taken it, if here he can become a big man, or big demigod, that is our self-interest. But that is not [indistinct]. That is not self-interest. Real self-interest is to go back to home, go back to Godhead.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu also directly teaches the same principle, and Kṛṣṇa also teaches the same principle because They are one. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is more kind, merciful than Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is teaching the same principle, but as the Supreme Personality of Godhead He commands, "Do this, rascal!" //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. That is His position. But the rascals are so rascals they could not understand Kṛṣṇa; they began to comment upon Kṛṣṇa in different way. They are so rascal that even very learned scholars that..., like..., mundane scholars---they’re not scholars, but so-called scholars. They are full of ignorance but proud of their material knowledge. //Āḍhya-māninā// [[books:sb:8:21:34|[SB 8.21.34]]], //vimukta-māninaḥ,// this word is used. //Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. These rascals, they are thinking only that have become very learned scholars, and sometimes they think, "We are now liberated," they have become Nārāyaṇa, and somebody is designating //daridra-nārāyaṇa,// so on, so on. That means actually they are not very learned, but //vimukta-māninaḥ,// they are thinking like that.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu, because these rascals, they have misunderstood Kṛṣṇa---"Why shall I surrender to Kṛṣṇa? I am also Kṛṣṇa"---therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu, without any condition, He’s distributing //kṛṣṇa-prema. Kṛṣṇa-prema// is not so easy thing. First of all one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. And what is //kṛṣṇa-prema?//

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

Big, big personalities, they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa, but Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so kind that in this age He understood that these rascals, they'll not understand what is Kṛṣṇa, and what to speak about //kṛṣṇa-prema?// [train passing overhead on bridge] Therefore Rūpa Gosvāmī offers prayers, //namo mahā-vadānyāya:// "Most munificent //avatāra.//" There are many //avatāras// of Kṛṣṇa: //advaitam acyutam anādir ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. He has done many millions and millions of //avatāras.// But this //avatāra,// Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is the most munificent, kind, merciful //avatāra.// In every //avatāra// He takes two parts,

> paritrāṇā sādhūnāṁ
> vināśāya ca duṣkṛti
> [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]

Cut off the head these rascals. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu does not. He, without any comparison, is giving //kṛṣṇa-prema, kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te.// That is detected by his pure devotee, Rūpa Gosvāmī, that "Here is..." Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, they understood, "Here is the Supreme Person."

> vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam-
> śikṣārtham ekaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]

Same Supreme Person, //purāṇaḥ.// He has come to teach us //vairāgya-vidyā.//

This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means //vairāgya-vidyā,// to become detestful to this material world. Because we are not becoming detestful. The //karmīs,// they are more and more becoming entangled: "Give me this, give me that, give me that"; ultimately, "Give me the post of Brahmā," "Give me the post of Indra." So their business is simply "give me." So they are //karmīs.// And //jñānīs,// when they are disgusted with this asking... They are also asking, but they are asking in a finer way, that "We shall become one with Viṣṇu. Why shall I ask?" He’s asking. He’s asking, "Make me one," but in a subtle way. He’s also beggar. And //yogīs,// they’re also asking, "Give me this mystic power. I shall manufacture gold and delude this poor conditioned soul," and advertise, "I have become God." These are third-class //yogīs.// First-class //yogīs,// they do not want. They, although get this power, like this, they do not utilize it; they simply, //dhyāna avasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. That is their [indistinct]: always meditating and seeing Kṛṣṇa.

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo 
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

He’s actually //yogī,// that always trying to seize the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, so that gradually they’ll be promoted to the pure devotional stage.

So unless one is situated in pure devotional stage, the perfection will be not be there. //Mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. Even if he becomes a very big //yogī,// he has to undergo suffering, //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam.// This world is like that. For practicing this //haṭha-yoga,// it requires much labor. It is not so easy. They are thinking that they have got this power, //yogī,// but it is exactly like if you want to become high-court judge, if you want to become prime minister---it is not so easy. You have to work very hard. Nobody gets all these posts so easily like [indistinct]. No. One has to work very hard. //Duḥkhālayam,// you have to undergo. You want some very exalted post in this material, either as //yogī,// or //karmī// or //jñānī,// it requires the hard labor. But a devotee, because he does not want anything like the //karmī, jñānī// and //yogī,// for them, //viśvaṁ pūrṇaṁ sukhāyate.// The whole material world is happy. //Viśvaṁ pūrṇaṁ sukhāyate.//

So this is possible by Caitanya Mahāprabhu’s mercy. It is possible. Therefore Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī has given us this instruction, that //yat kāruṇya katākṣa vaibhavavātaṁ// [Caitanya-candrāmṛta 5]. It is possible to become perfectly cent percent happy by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Not even full mercy. If Caitanya Mahāprabhu simply looks over anyone, directly person will be happy as [indistinct]. Take mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and distribute it throughout the whole world. This is the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
