**Prabhupāda:**
But one cannot give up the family life, and it was an opportunity to give up family life. So it is blessing in disguise.

**Abhirāma:**
I'm sometimes thinking that if my activities were more purified...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Always be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.

**Abhirāma:**
But trouble is, it seems that in my..., engaged in management work, sometimes my spiritual activities suffer. That is unfortunate.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Management is also spiritual activity. Why do you take like that? It is Kṛṣṇa's establishment.

**Abhirāma:**
But my wife never sees that. Unless I am just chanting //japa// and offering Deity worship, otherwise it's all nonsense.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, she is also a woman. [chuckles] She has no much intelligence. But here, to manage Kṛṣṇa's affairs is also Kṛṣṇa's work. Don't take it otherwise. We must be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's business. That's all. That is our duty. Fighting is very good business? Killing? But why Arjuna "Yes"? //Kariṣye vacanam// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. And Kṛṣṇa said, //bhakto 'si priyo 'si me// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]: "You are My devotee, very dear friend." What he was doing? Fighting. The fighting is good business, to kill others? But for Kṛṣṇa's sake.

**Abhirāma:**
Sometimes I am thinking...

**Prabhupāda:**
He personally denied, "No, no, no. I don't want this kingdom." Personally he had no desire. But when he saw that Kṛṣṇa wants it, "All right. I shall do it." And this is Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Abhirāma:**
I always thought that you appreciate it when we try to manage, so therefore I have tried to stay on here.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you are managing very well. I am very satisfied. Do it. [pause] There was no water. Sometimes the tap becomes...

**Abhirāma:**
Because so many guests are here today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Abhirāma:**
Some of these boys do not know how to use water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is...

**Abhirāma:**
They wash clothes with three or four buckets of water. But otherwise there's...

**Prabhupāda:**
Some of them should go there, in the pond.

**Abhirāma:**
I have just informed today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. When you have got that water tank, it is enjoyable, more, to take bath.

**Abhirāma:**
Yes. It is Ganga water also. Ganga water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So as soon as possible they should go there.

**Hari-śauri:**
I bathed there this afternoon. It was all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, it is very nice. //Avagana-bhak//[?]. To dip into the water is refreshing, very refreshing. It is enjoyable. You artificially create tank in your country, bathing tank, and here is tank. Why should you not enjoy?

**Hari-śauri:**
Swimming pools.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Abhirāma:**
Gargamuni Swami says it is contaminated, that water.

**Prabhupāda:**
"It is contaminated for you, not for us." Why contaminated? So many people are taking. In Bengal, all villagers, they take bath in the pond, this tank. Large quantity water is not contaminated. A small quantity water is contaminated.

**Abhirāma:**
Everything is there, the fish and this...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Abhirāma:**
Everything is keeping it clean. So Śrīla Prabhupāda? I have built one home at Māyāpur. Perhaps you have been told. My plan was to leave my wife there, because she likes a peaceful place. City life she cannot live. And I would stay in Calcutta, say, four days a week and go on weekends to Māyāpur.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. Go.

**Abhirāma:**
That way there be some separation. At the same time she would have...

**Prabhupāda:**
Gradually full separation. And she'll be... [break] [end]
