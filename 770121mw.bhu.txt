[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa says one who is completely free from sinful life, he can become perfectly a devotee. So these are the four pillars of sinful life. //Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam// [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]. [aside:] Oh, it is nice park.

**Rāmeśvara:**
But because this is the age of Kali, even if the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement spreads and even captures governments, how can we stop individual people from doing this? [car stops]

**Prabhupāda:**
No. You cannot expect cent percent will be sinless. But there must be an ideal section---"Oh, here is..." That is wanted. That is wanted. Not that you can expect cent percent ideal.

**Gargamuni:**
Gate's locked?

**Hari-śauri:**
So that ideal should be the persons who are living in our //āśramas.//

**Rāmeśvara:**
[referring to park] No, they're in there.

**Gargamuni:**
That's our man. He jumped over the fence to get the gate open open.

**Rāmeśvara:**
But now, suppose there is some businessman, and he knows that everybody is wanting this sex. So he is making movie or writing a book describing these things.

**Prabhupāda:**
These things were formerly restricted---censor board.

**Rāmeśvara:**
So there must be censorship...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rāmeśvara:**
...in a Kṛṣṇa conscious...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Rāmeśvara:**
...government.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Censorship of television, radio, all media.

**Prabhupāda:**
So let us... [car door opens] [break] The people are becoming godless. How much degradation. Lord Rāmacandra appeared, Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared, Lord Buddha appeared, Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared, and many others, and the people of India, they are becoming godless. Why? Do you follow what I say? //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. And He does it in India, within this universe. And they are become now... This is Kali-yuga. Other countries, they may, but India, so fortunate birth---//bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya janma// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]---they are becoming degraded so much so that they are doubting, asking questions. [break] [end]
