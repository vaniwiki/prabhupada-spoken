**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...the society. Eh? Father, mother, killing children, is that human society?

**Rāmeśvara:**
No, lower than animal.

**Prabhupāda:**
You see? And we have to tolerate this?

**Rāmeśvara:**
Well, what about all these artificial divisions, "this nation," "that nation," "this land"?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is also another fanaticism.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Nationalism.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is another fanaticism, gundaism. Not nationalism---gundaism. "Everything belongs to God. We are sons of God. We must enjoy everywhere. You cannot check."

**Rāmeśvara:**
It seems that eventually, then, the Kṛṣṇa conscious movement will establish one world government.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is wanted. Actually that is the meaning.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Within the period of...

**Prabhupāda:**
We actually do. When you go to the sea, who claims "This is my sea"?

**Hari-śauri:**
Actually they're doing that now. They have twelve-mile limits and things like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is also limited. So twelve miles...

**Hari-śauri:**
Middle of Atlantic they're not claiming.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There is no claim.

**Rāmeśvara:**
So Lord Caitanya's movement will actually reach that level.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]: "Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa." We are all children. The America is protecting for Americans. "No! No American. Let the Chinese. They are so well congested. The Indians, come on!" You came here. It is not your father's property. Why do you check others, rascal? You stolen this property from the Red Indian, and now you have become proprietor.

**Rāmeśvara:**
And they're paying the farmers not to grow food in America.

**Hari-śauri:**
Subsidizing it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. That is //pūrṇam idam// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. By God's arrangement everything is full. There is no question of overpopulation. Just see. So much land is lying vacant. There is no utilization.

**Rāmeśvara:**
No, they should use their science for developing the resources for the benefit of all people.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no needs of science. This is the science: chant Hare Kṛṣṇa; there will be sufficient rain, and you till the ground and grow food.

**Hari-śauri:**
Actually, by their science...

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the science.

**Hari-śauri:**
Their science is incapable.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. If there is... What is your nonsense science? If there is no rain, drought, what you can do?

**Hari-śauri:**
They can't develop their science to that point where they can...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, these... These scientists are rascals. I call them rascals. That's...

**Hari-śauri:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
...to make them fatter. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
So madman they are.

**Rāmeśvara:**
It was in //Reader's Digest.// They had that idea. And they described one man who invested fifty thousand dollars and imported crabs from... Where? Australia?

**Hari-śauri:**
Indonesia.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Indonesia. And he put them in a pond. He was thinking, "They will reproduce, and I'll have huge family of crabs."

**Prabhupāda:**
That you can have. That is material...

**Rāmeśvara:**
And the crabs, in such close quarters, they began eating each other.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Acchā?//

**Rāmeśvara:**
And at the end he had one crab left for his fifty thousand dollars. [chuckling]

**Prabhupāda:**
A madman working. //Chāgale nā khāya, pāgale ki bale.// "A madman, what does he not say, and a goat, what does he not eat?" There is a system like that amongst the Muhammadan aristocracy. They keep one hundred chickens. Each day they kill one chicken, and that flesh, chopped up and given to the ninety-nine. Then, next day another. In this way, when one is left, that the master eats. Concentrating from hundred to one, and then he eats it. This is Muhammadan process.

**Rāmeśvara:**
What is the use?

**Prabhupāda:**
They know. [chuckling] They think the hundred chickens' vitamin comes into one.

**Hari-śauri:**
//Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
And by eating such chicken, you don't require one cloth. That is aristocracy. They, during severe cold, they will have fine //panjabi.// You know //panjabi?//

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes, very thin.

**Prabhupāda:**
And if you wear... [break] [end]
