**Prabhupāda:**
It was heart attack.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise I could not understand. So I passed through third heart attacks. One, two, three. They say that anyone who gets heart attack, the third attack, he must expire. Heart attack.

**Hari-śauri:**
You had three attacks on the ship.

**Prabhupāda:**
Two.

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh. And then one when you got to...

**Prabhupāda:**
New York. Third one---paralyzed.

**Hari-śauri:**
Very bad one.

**Prabhupāda:**
Left side paralyzed. I do not know how we were saved.

**Hari-śauri:**
[chuckles] Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
And one girl, that captain's wife, she studied astrology. She was... She said, "Swāmījī, if you can survive your seventieth year, then you'll live for one hundred years." [Hari-śauri laughs] So, somehow or other, I survived my seventieth year. I do not know whether I shall live for hundred years, but seventieth year was severe---three heart attacks and paralysis.

**Hari-śauri:**
All in the same year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then without any family. At that time none of you were with me. I was alone. I was completely dependent on anyone.

**Hari-śauri:**
Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
But on the ship I saw that "Kṛṣṇa is with me." I was going for this reas... [someone enters] Hare Kṛṣṇa. So they are not here, some //prasāda// to eat?

**Hari-śauri:**
There's a little extra. He can take some. They'll all be eating Jagannātha //prasādam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall be eating also. No? No? Jagannātha //prasādam?//

**Hari-śauri:**
Well, he was going to cook.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which is better, eh? Jagannātha?

**Hari-śauri:**
[laughs] I don't know. Whatever you like. At least, if we cook here, you'll get hot //prasādam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
A little Jagannātha //prasādam// also.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. They can bring some. I traveled for a month myself on a boat. I went from England to Australia on ship.

**Prabhupāda:**
One month? Only?

**Hari-śauri:**
Twenty-eight days.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Through Atlantic.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. We had to go Atlantic and then right round the tip of Africa and across the Indian Ocean, because the Suez Canal was finished then. It was blocked by the war.

**Prabhupāda:**
Suez Canal still not open?

**Hari-śauri:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
What they have done, these...? They were getting, minimum, fifty thousand rupees daily.

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh, at least.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what, these nonsense politicians? They lost the money, and inconvenience to others. These rascal politician, they can do anything whimsical. They were getting money, not less than fifty thousand, not smaller than daily fifty thousand. From business point of view they could have raised the toll. They could get more money. What is the use of stopping?

**Hari-śauri:**
Well, they raised the price of oil instead.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Hari-śauri:**
They raised the price of oil instead. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Muhammadan... Brain fag. And they are thieves. The captains said that they are all thieves, these Egyptians.

**Hari-śauri:**
Arabs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Arabs. Vast desert we saw, passing. Huge stack of sand. How they are living there?

**Hari-śauri:**
Certainly not for a civilized man. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
This stove is our?

**Hari-śauri:**
It's Gargamuni's. [break] [end]
