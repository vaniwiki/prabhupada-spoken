**Gargamuni:**
Your lecture was very nice. 

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. We all loved that lecture very much last night.

**Gargamuni:**
Very open. Very humbly, you were... Although they have done so much, you were very humble in your approach of requesting them to help us.

**Satsvarūpa:**
And telling them how Jagannātha has gone everywhere, all over the world. If they want to make Him Oriya-nātha they can, but He's already going.

**Gargamuni:**
Yes, He's Jagannātha.

**Hari-śauri:**
And your point that He is //sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]], so if the people from //sarva-loka// want to come and have //darśana,// then why should they be stopped?

**Gargamuni:**
Very good points were made.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Some of the //paṇḍitas,// though, left. Some the //paṇḍitas// left as soon as you began to speak. Some of them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Left?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Yes. Immediately got up and they went over and started that demigod //pūjā.//

**Gargamuni:**
They purposefully, I think, started that //ārati// because you were lecturing.

**Gurukṛpā:**
That was their plan.

**Gargamuni:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, it was a plan?

**Gargamuni:**
Yes.

**Gurukṛpā:**
They got up and went over there.

**Gargamuni:**
Yes. And I saw them talking as if they were planning what to do. And then they went over behind and then started that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. So they wanted to create some disturbance?

**Gargamuni:**
Well, they wanted to disrupt your lecture.

**Hari-śauri:**
It's not certain. 'Cause I heard that man, this...

**Prabhupāda:**
Sadāśiva.

**Hari-śauri:**
Sadāśiva... Some of the other men wondered why they were leaving, and he said, "Well, they have to go and do their //pūjā.//"

**Gurukṛpā:**
That's an excuse.

**Gargamuni:**
That's an excuse.

**Hari-śauri:**
It may be an excuse; it may not be.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Prabhupāda's a great guest. They come all this way for ten minutes?

**Gargamuni:**
Prabhupāda's a well-reknowned man. They would have stayed and wanted to hear.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. They're envious. Otherwise they wouldn't have left at all.

**Gargamuni:**
So it was planned. They planned it that way.

**Prabhupāda:**
The solution is... There is no problem for us. Even if we do not enter the temple, that is no problem. But if we can start a nice temple, people will come, the same thing as in Vṛndāvana.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. That's certain.

**Prabhupāda:**
The //bābājīs// or //gosāis// are against us, but who cares for them? Our temple is going on.

**Hari-śauri:**
We get more people in our temple in one night than they get all year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not only more people. Our temple is gorgeous than any temple.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. That's a fact.

**Gargamuni:**
There is life. The places we visited last night, there was no life. There wasn't even enough light. They have no light. They use... To save money they use 15-watt light bulbs.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Nor could they afford one sweet apiece. They were giving us...

**Hari-śauri:**
Breaking off our one sweet. [laughs] And no one's attending their //āratis// or...

**Gurukṛpā:**
In Māyāpur now so many people come. The road is not big enough.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Gurukṛpā:**
The road is not big enough.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Gurukṛpā:**
Yes. There's that many people coming. I could not believe. So many people. And just a regular weekend. We need one way in and one way out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Big road.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Yes. So many people coming, all respectable people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Our gateways, you mean to say.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Yes. Our road.

**Gargamuni:**
This year we've noticed that more respectable people are coming, well dressed, from the areas.

**Prabhupāda:**
That, er... Behind our new house, that Muhammadan wanted to sell that land. But if he wants to sell at our price, not his price, we can take it.

**Gargamuni:**
Yes, at our price. He knows that. But he wants his price.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Gargamuni:**
He wants... What is it? Five thousand per //bighā.// Something like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
We can pay, utmost, one thousand five hundred, as we have paid.

**Gargamuni:**
Well, land prices have gone up since then. I think now they're running eighteen hundred. They're running eighteen hundred. That was in '71 we were paying fifteen hundred. But now we have to expect to pay, say, eighteen hundred. This land is valuable because it produces so much. That is why it is most costly. You get very good crops from our, this land.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that land I shall use, if I take it, for another gate---in and out. That is my idea.

**Gargamuni:**
Oh, I see.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Well, we are putting a road in front of this new building. There's a road in front of the new building.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Gurukṛpā:**
There must be some walkway.

**Gargamuni:**
How people will... Just like where the wall is? There's one little road for walking. So similarly, in front of the long, this new building, will be one road for walking.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you have to break these houses.

**Gurukṛpā:**
No, it goes around.

**Gargamuni:**
It goes around. Do you have that photograph? I'll show you.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where is that photograph? Find out.

**Gargamuni:**
I gave you one small photograph of the building.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Find out. I kept it in that, inside that booklet.

**Hari-śauri:**
Which booklet?

**Prabhupāda:**
Gargamuni has printed?

**Hari-śauri:**
I don't even know where that book... Someone took that booklet away.

**Gargamuni:**
I have another photo I can show. If you get my bag... [break] [end]
