[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...obedient to God---that means offer sacrifices---then there will be regular rain. And if there is regular rain, any damn land is good for any purpose. Land has been made bad because there is no regular rain. They... Why the desert is? If there is regular rain, the desert will be also fertile. So it is gradually becoming desert. The whole world will be desert. No production. Suffer. Make your scientific research, godless. All rascals, full of rascals... [horn beeping] [break] There is a proposal. You know that? Just see how great rascals they are. They'll import water.

**Gurukṛpā:**
They have done that in California. They have piped water into the desert and made it the most fertile place.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. What is desert? Desert means no water. There is no rain.

**Gargamuni:**
In Israel, which is a desert, they are exporting food all over the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Every land will be fertile and usable if there is water. That's all. They are making scientific research.

**Satsvarūpa:**
So if they can bring water by pipe, then they don't need //yajña.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is also another foolishness. How much water he'll carry by pipe? [aside:] Where is pole? Take water from God. That is sufficient. //Navadit tarims ca//[?]. When there is water supplied by God, where there is no need of water there will be water. Just like on the hills, on the mountains, there is no need of water. In the ocean there is no need of water. But the God... "All right, take water here also." That is God's gift. You rascal, how much water you have got that you transport by pipe and this and that? All rascals. //Mūḍha.// They can simply address as rascals. That's all. That is my language, always. These are all rascals. Godless means //mūḍha,// rascal, //duṣkṛtina.// They will attempt so many things, simply waste their time and energy. //Duṣkṛtina.// Because they are rascals. //Mūḍha. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. And a human being should have intelligence, but they are lower, lowest status of the human being. //Mūḍha, duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ narādhamāḥ.// "No, the university education..." //Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.// Everything is analytically spoken. Why all these things? //Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.// Because godless, no intelligence. Anyone who is godless, he has no intelligence. This is the conclusion. They are intelligent amongst the similar rascals. //Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:19|[SB 2.3.19]]]. He's intelligent among the dogs, among the camels, among the hogs and the asses. They will praise them, "Oh, you are so intelligent. You are so educated." Not human being. Just like dog receives his master, [makes growling sounds] "//Grw, grw, grw, grw,//" like that. So what is that reception, dog's reception? Similarly, these intelligent men are intelligent amongst a class of men who are compared with dogs, hogs, camel and asses. They are not human being. If some man praises them, that "You are so big. You are so big leader," he's also amongst this group. //Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ.// This is grave thing. Let understand it, that anyone who is godless, who has no idea what is God, he is a rascal. Immediately take him that he's a rascal. He may be prime minister, he may be president, he may be scientist, but we shall take him as rascal number one. This is our first understanding. //Bokā.// My Guru Mahārāja used to say //bokā.// So at that time I was thinking, "Everyone is //bokā?//" [laughing] Guru Mahārāja says, "Everyone..." "Even Rabindranath Tagore, he is also //bokā.//" Later on I could under..., "Yes. Everyone is //bokā.//"

**Satsvarūpa:**
You were surprised that he was saying at first, "Everyone is rascal."

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes.

**Satsvarūpa:**
We were all too. When you said Gandhi, we were shocked, because we thought he was a great saint. And he's also rascal.

**Gurukṛpā:**
When you say it in public... In private meeting you say... The other night you said that this Munshi was a rascal, everyone was...

**Prabhupāda:**
Who? Who? Whom I said?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Munshi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Munshi, ah, yes. [laughs]

**Gurukṛpā:**
Everybody was, "Is it true?"

**Prabhupāda:**
He did not believe in Kṛṣṇa. And from his character he's a rascal. I know that.

**Hari-śauri:**
The one thing that shocks the Indians the most is Vivekananda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they're rascals. Modern population in India, they are all rascals. Whole population is //bokā.//

**Gargamuni:**
No. The Marwaris don't like him because he was a chicken-eater.

**Prabhupāda:**
Marwaris are little religious. They...

**Gargamuni:**
They never talk about Vivekananda. They don't like him.

**Prabhupāda:**
He was rascal number one. He brought three women with whom he had intimate connection. That is very easy to make intimate connection with woman in America. With money also. He brought. And with their money... Aurobindo also, the same thing. With woman's money they became rich---not like me, with hard labor of writing books and selling. I could also do. There was chance. But this is not my business to make intimate relation with woman and get money. I could do. There was chance. When attempt was failed, the man who introduced that woman to me, he one day said, "I have seen many //svāmīs,// but none like you." [laughter]

**Gargamuni:**
They advised you to grow a beard and to wear Western suit, the other //svāmīs.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...in a different style, that's all. [break] ...money. These rascals are also after woman and money, in a different style. //Asat eka strī-saṅgī// [[books:cc:madhya:22:87|[Cc. Madhya 22.87]]]. Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately rejects him, that "He's a rascal. He's after women." Immediately. //Asat strī-saṅgī.// Two kinds of rascal---nondevotee of Kṛṣṇa and woman-hunter---reject immediately. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's... The //sannyāsa// life is... What is that? Cent percent, no connection with woman. That is //sannyāsa.// What we have renounced? We have renounced... We are using the motorcar, we are using this machine, we are eating, we are sleeping in nice room---what is the renouncement? Only renouncement is no connection with woman. That is the real platform of renouncement. If one can renounce woman's connection, then he's liberated man. That is very, very difficult. [break] Except myself, they go for woman and money, that's all, in foreign countries. This is the position. This Vishnu, Vishnu... Vishnananda, Vishnu-ananda? Now what is that? One //yogī// is in Montreal?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Vishnu-something-ananda.

**Prabhupāda:**
He also is after women. That's all.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Swami Saccidananda.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is also.

**Satsvarūpa:**
He was exposed with fourteen-year-old girl.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Just see.

**Satsvarūpa:**
And Yogi Bhajan.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is openly.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. He comes with his women.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is openly. His philosophy is how to enjoy women, tantric.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. He advertises sex for..., //yoga// for two. He has a special price that a couple can come and learn //tantra-yoga// in America. And then Guru Maharaj Ji, he married.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tantra-yoga// means they will have sex, and he will be able not to discharge. That is //tantra-yoga.// The woman likes a man who does not easily discharge. This is //tantra-yoga.// So he is teaching that art, or science. They will prove their tantric success that while sex there is no discharge.

**Satsvarūpa:**
I spoke to one of them and said that for spiritual life you had to refrain from sex, and he said, "No. If you do this enough, then you will not have any more desire." Otherwise if you just refrain, that is not as thorough.

**Prabhupāda:**
So many things going on. Very difficult to lead spiritual life.

Actually one who is serious going back to home, back to Godhead---for such person, one should be //niṣkiñcana,// no connection with these material woman and money. //Niṣkiñcanasya.// [break] But I am not collecting money for sense gratification. For preaching work. //Kṛṣṇa-sambandhe... Kṛṣṇa sabaya yāhā haya anukula, viṣaya boliyā tāhā haya phul.//[?] The anything which is favorable to my preaching work, that is not //viṣaya. Ta phul//[?]. Then that is mistake. Why the air is misty? That... [break] Similarly, you can kill. You have to see it, what for they are killing. Stalin was killing for his own sense gratification. He wanted to maintain himself in the position, and anyone going against him, he would kill. That was not for the citizens' benefit. For his own benefit. Therefore he's a criminal. Just like soldier is killing hundreds of thousands of other soldiers. He is being awarded, "Oh, you are brave." And as soon as he kills one man for his own---he is hanged. So we have to see what is the cause that Arjuna fought for Kṛṣṇa, he became a devotee. //Bhakto 'si priyo 'si// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]: very dear friend. What is the business? To kill. There are different.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Isn't it true also that, in the Kṛṣṇa conscious state, that a rascal, he may be allowed to live if he does his rascaldom but within the regulations? Like there's even allowance for eating meat and for going to the prostitute. Not that he'll be automatically killed, but...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, who said like that?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Well, there are some purports in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that say there'll always be a class of men who will do this thing, so the prostitute is natural in society. That will keep him from at least going to...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another thing. Because there are rascals, they will pollute their homely wives and sisters, you can allow to go to the prostitute.

**Satsvarūpa:**
So it's not that they are automatically killed, but at least they must...

**Prabhupāda:**
They are killing... They are... Prostitution... But to save the society from their pollution, the concession is there, "Go to prostitute." They are killing themselves.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Just like Mahārāja Parīkṣit, he did not kill the Kali, either, when he found...

**Prabhupāda:**
He was ready to kill. When he surrendered, he gave him some shelter. [end]
