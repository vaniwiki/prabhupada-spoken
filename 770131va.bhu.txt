**Prabhupāda:**
Today, Varāha-dvādaśī, appearance of Kṛṣṇa's taking the incarnation of Varāha, boar. //Keśava dhṛta-śūkara-rūpa jaya jagadīśa hare.//

So,

> rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan
> nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu
> kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yo
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.39]

Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, //ādi-puruṣa,// the original person, He is taking various forms. //Rāmādi-murtiṣu// specially. Three Rāma: Paraśurāma, Balarāma and Daśarathi Rāma. So this Rāma means enjoyment. So Kṛṣṇa's enjoyment... It does not mean---Kṛṣṇa has appeared as the boar---it does not mean He is suffering. Everything is //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis// [Bs. 5.37]. Sometimes a big man becomes a horse. It is... There is a very nice interesting story that the big Prime Minister Gladstone, English, English Prime Minister, Gladstone?

**Devotee:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So somebody came to see him for an interview. So the servant informed the visitor that "The Prime Minister is now busy, you have to wait." So he was waiting. He was big man. So one hour passed, so he became inquisitive. So with little opening of the door, he wanted to see the "How this man is engaged? I am waiting for one hour." So he saw that the Prime Minister has become a horse, taking his grandchild on the back, and he's playing like a horse. And the important visitor is waiting for one hour. So this is enjoyment. The Prime Minister is not the horse, but he is enjoying taking his grandchild on the back, and he was playing like horse and the grandchild was, "//Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut!//" This was his engagement. So similarly, because he has become the horse of his grandchild, he is not horse, he is enjoying. That is enjoyment. Similarly, when //keśava dhṛta-śūkara-rūpa// or //kesava dhṛta-varāha-rūpa// does not mean that He is //varāha// or He is crocodile or He is something like... No. He's everything. But that is not by //karma.// When we become crocodile, that is //karma,// punishment. We are now human being. It may be next life I become a crocodile according to //karma,// be forced by the laws of nature. Just like in Honolulu, Hawaii, we see so many young boys, they are enjoying, they are surfing in the middle of the ocean, struggling. So our //karma,// if you are practiced to that way, then at the time of death I shall think of just, in the middle ocean, swimming and struggling, then Kṛṣṇa will give opportunity to become a aquatic. Very easily we can remain within the water. That is the laws of nature. //Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran loke tyajaty ante kalevaram// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]].

So our taking the shape of crocodile or boar or something animal, that is //karma.// But that is a horse, real horse is //karma,// but the Gladstone's becoming horse, that is not //karma;// that is enjoyment. We should understand like that, that when //keśava dhṛta-kūrma-śarīra// and //varāha-śarīra,// He's not forced by //karma. Na māṁ karmāṇi limpanti// [[books:bg:4:14|[Bg. 4.14]]]. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, na me karma-phale spṛhā.// He is self-sufficient. So everything His enjoyment. We are also seeking enjoyment because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So //ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. Kṛṣṇa or His part and parcel, the same quality. Kṛṣṇa is seeking enjoyment, and we are also seeking enjoyment, but we can enjoy together in the spiritual world without any hamper, without any impediment.

> ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis
> tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ
> goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.37]

When we dance with Kṛṣṇa in the Goloka Vṛndāvana, both of us are enjoying. Kṛṣṇa is enjoying; we are also enjoying. But if we want to enjoy independent of Kṛṣṇa or to imitate Kṛṣṇa or to become Kṛṣṇa, then it is //māyā.// Then it is //māyā.// This material world means the same enjoying spirit is there within me, but if I want to become Kṛṣṇa or enjoy independently, then it is //māyā.// So therefore we should enjoy with Kṛṣṇa. That is the aim of. The same thing is there.

So Kṛṣṇa comes, therefore, personally appears and exhibits His enjoying love in Vṛndāvana. He brings His friends, His girlfriends, boyfriends, everything, His father, His mother, and shows that "The enjoyment which you are seeking, that is there in the spiritual world with Me. See how I am enjoying." Just so that we may have our brain clear that if we enjoy with Kṛṣṇa, we can enjoy the dance, the paternal love, the conjugal love, the friendly playing with boys, with animals, who is in the garden, in the forest, in the water---same thing is there. Everything is there, all the sporting, but spiritual. So this is Kṛṣṇa's //līlā. Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis// [Bs. 5.37].

So we are seeking pleasure within this material world. That is imitation. That is not real enjoyment. But the basic principle of enjoyment is there. Here there is imitation enjoyment---love between young boy, young girl. So wherefrom it comes? It is there in Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise how it can come? It is not possible. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. This loving exchange between young boy, young girl is there. Kṛṣṇa is also enjoying there. The //gopīs,// the young girls, Kṛṣṇa is young... The exchange of love between father and son, mother and son; the exchange of love between friend and friend; the exchange of love between animal and man... We, just like we keep so many animals, Kṛṣṇa is also enjoying with the calves. Sometimes with other animal also. Same thing is there. It is simply imitation here. Otherwise, everything is there in the spiritual world. We are mistaking, here, //karma-phala-vadya//[?]. But here is no inebrieties, in the spiritual world. Here it is full of inebrieties. You'll see that Kṛṣṇa is enjoying with the //gopīs,// but there is no inebriety. There is no pregnancy, there is no abortion. That is the beauty. And the material world, the love is turns into lusty desires, and it entails so many difficulties. //Yan-maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tucchaṁ kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Here sex life means entailed with so many sufferings. But there is no sex life in the spiritual world, but the pleasure is there. That is the difference between material and spiritual. Therefore there is restriction. Just like sex life is there, but a tuberculosis patient, if he enjoys sex life, he'll die very soon. Without sex life he could live for some years. Everyone will die. So for tuberculosis patient sex life is strictly prohibited.

So when there is prohibition... Just like in the material world there is prohibition, "No sex life," because we are patient here, tuberculosis patient. If we enjoy sex life, then we'll die. Die means... We are already dead because we have to accept this dead body. This body is dead. But so long I am within this body, simply it is moving. Just like motorcar. Motorcar is a lump of matter, but when the driver is acting, it is moving. Similarly this body... By //māyā// we are thinking that this body is living. It is not living; it is dead. From the very beginning it is dead. And when the soul will go away, it will appear its real identity---dead. Otherwise it is dead. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that "You are lamenting on this body? Oh, you are such a rascal." //Nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.// Those who are learned, they do not care for this body, either dead or alive. It is dead matter. So why should you lament for the dead matter?

> aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ
> prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase
> gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca
> nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ
> [[books:bg:2:11|[Bg. 2.11]]]

This is spiritual life. When we are not at all concerned with this body, material body, that is the beginning of spiritual life. And so long we are interested with the dead lump of matter, without any information of the spirit soul within it, that is material life. This is the difference between material life and spiritual life.

One who is in ignorance, without any knowledge of the spirit soul and identifying with this body and trying to enjoy life, he is implicated. Implicated. Life after life we change, and enjoy in different ways. What is the enjoyment? The enjoyment is eating, sleeping, sex and defense. So either you become one little insect or you become Brahmā---the same enjoyment in different forms. Therefore //punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]], repeating the same process---eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Hmm? But there is a life eternal, which is not this eating-sleeping, but another enjoyment, //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa// [Bs. 5.37]. We can get it. So therefore in this life we should understand, we should be little sober, that "This is our diseased condition. I am eternal." //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. "Why I am put into this condition of birth, death, old age and disease? This is my disease. This is not healthy condition." So one who is sober, //dhīra,// he understands that "This is my tuberculosis disease state." We should restrict all the so-called material happiness and prepare for the spiritual life, eternal life That is a human consciousness. Otherwise you are in darkness, //mūḍha. Duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama.// Life is lost.

So Kṛṣṇa has so many //līlās,// activities. Kṛṣṇa is not different from His activities; He is absolute. So these are the occasions we can hear about His activities. We are benefited. Therefore He plays sometimes as //mīna-śarīra,// as //varāha-śarīra,// as //kūrma-śarīra. Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu-kalā niyamena.// There are hundreds and thousands of incarnations. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. Just like you cannot count the waves of the river---it is going on continually---similarly, the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa is going on eternally, so many. If you take the opportunity of hearing---//śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ visnoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]---about Viṣṇu's //līlā,// activities... And if you simply stick to the //nirakāra// Brahman, what we shall hear? Therefore they fall down, these Māyāvādīs who simply take seriously the impersonal feature of Kṛṣṇa, because there is no //līlā.// "//Brahman brahman ahaṁ brahman brahman,//" then how long it will go on? It will be hackneyed. But when we take to Kṛṣṇa's personal activities, there are newer, newer, newer, and multi and many... Then we get the opportunity of hearing Kṛṣṇa. Then you stick. Otherwise, if I simply become understood about the Brahman feature, it will be hackneyed, because we want, seek, //ānanda,// pleasure. So in the impersonal feature there is no pleasure. Just like in the sky, even if you take a very nice airplane and simply fly in the sky, you'll be very much displeased. That is our practical experience. If you go in the sea and for months together remain in the sea, you'll be very much sick. We want pleasure. We want pleasure, varieties. That is Kṛṣṇa's desire. He also discovered varieties of pleasure, and if we join with Him, we also enjoy the varieties of pleasure eternally in the spiritual world. That is success of life.

Thank you very much.
