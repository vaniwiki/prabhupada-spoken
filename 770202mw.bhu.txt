**Prabhupāda:**
The learned scholars, they used to live in the forest. Vyāsadeva was writing in //śāmyaprāśa// cottage. [chuckling] That is university. And no university can produce such scholar or student, not imperfect. They're all rascals. What are the values of these M.A., Ph.D.? [break] It is humbug. //Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. Actually they're //vimūḍhān. Mūḍha// means rascal, and //vimūḍhān// means special rascals. [laughs] //Māyā-sukhāya,// for some sense gratification---big, big arrangement. And next life he's going to be a dog. That's all. So Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "I am thinking of these rascals, //vimūḍhān,// especially rascals, that they are arranging so gorgeous thing for material happiness and forgetting their spiritual identity." //Śoce:// "I am simply thinking of these rascals. For me there is no problem." //Tato vimukha-cetasaḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. "Because they are bereft of God consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are doing, engaged in these big, big projects, although live for twenty years or fifty years utmost, perhaps. And eternal life? They do not know." //Vimūḍhān:// "specially rascal." The cats and dogs are rascals, but they are animals; they cannot know anything. But they got this human form of life, and still, they are acting as rascal. Therefore //vimūḍhān,// "specially rascal." //Manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā, jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu.// Such a rascal. [break] ...where charity is given, to be given, give him. That's all. //Dātavyam.// [break] "...by the people, for the people." And what is the people condition? They are naked. They have no good house, no food. And these men, they must have very good bungalow, very good, comfortable life. This is Kali-yuga, means "Plunder the citizens, take money from them, and live comfortably at the cost of the poor citizens."

**Gargamuni:**
Most of these bungalows here are offices. Government offices.

**Prabhupāda:**
That I said. They are living very comfortably, and the citizens... We have seen the other day, Cuttack, the //marwan//[?] shop, congested.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Dirty.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dirty. Actually they are earning for them. Taxation. They have got law, and they are advertising...

**Satsvarūpa:**
"Don't cheat on your tax."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Don't cheat..."

**Satsvarūpa:**
"Or you'll be persecuted."

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is cheating? They're cheating. Just see. They are working hard; they are cheating. And they, by taxation getting money and living very comfortably, they are not cheating.

**Gargamuni:**
They are greater cheaters.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is Kali-yuga.

> dudha gali gali phire surā baitale vikāra
> dhanya kali-yuga teri līlā duḥkha lāge haspar[?]

Tulasī dāsa has said, "In the Kali-yuga, //dudha,// milk---no customer. And //surā,// wine---//baitale vikāra.//[?] It is sitting down in one place, and customers are going there: "Give me. Give me one after another." //Surā,// wine, is so impure that it should not be touched. That is selling in one place very comfortably. //Dudha? Gali gali phire:// "Will you take milk? Will you take milk?" //Dudha gali gali phire surā baitale vikāra, dhanya kali-yuga teri līlā. Kali-yuga dhanya tomāra.//[?] "Your pastime..." //Duḥkha lāge haspar,// "I am very sorry, but at the same time, I am laughing." [laughs] "Although I am very sorry, but still, I am laughing." This is Kali-yuga.

> dudha gali gali phire surā baitale vikāra
> dhanya kali-yuga teri līlā duḥkha lāge haspar[?]

And in Vedic civilization, animal is being attempted to be killed---"Oh! Who are you?" "Kali-yuga." "Get out!" This is //rāja,// king. And there is nobody to protest. So many animals are being killed. This is Kali-yuga. Why? "They are my subject. You cannot touch." Kṛṣṇa is embracing //gopīs// and the calves also, not that He has selected only //gopīs// to be embraced. //Sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. "Anyone who loves Me... Loves or not, I am protecting." //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. He's giving protection to everyone. And if he is a devotee, a special protection. This is God, and government means God's representative. God's, not people's representative. Government does not mean people's representative. Government means God's representative. That is government. //Rājarṣi. Imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. //Bhagavad-gītā// is not meant for the loafer class. It is meant for the //rājarṣi.// Unless the kings and big, big stalwart leaders understand this science, how they will lead? Because these leaders, they do not understand //Bhagavad-gītā;// they make their own plan. Therefore so much catastrophe, chaotic condition. It is meant for the //rājarṣi.// Big, big government officer, big, big kings, presidents, ministers, they should understand it. And government is making law, "No //Bhagavad-gītā// in the school, college," because they do not know the value. [break] ...Kali-yuga. "Kali-yuga, thank you very much." //Dhanya kali-yuga teri līlā.// [hums] [break] Thank you.

**Gargamuni:**
Sometimes these professional people accuse us of living at the cost of others.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But you are so rascal that you do not know who should be maintained at your cost. Those who are learned scholars, those who can give you good direction, they should be allowed to live very comfortably, without any want. That is Vedic civilization. //Brāhmaṇas... Dātavyam iti yad dānam// [[books:bg:17:20|[Bg. 17.20]]]. Give them charity. All the big, big kings, they used to give charity. Give them cows, give them ornament, give them money, give them gold. //Brāhmaṇa-bhojana.// Invite the //brāhmaṇas,// give them sumptuous food. They never said //daridra-bhojana, daridra-nārāyaṇa-bhojana.// They never said. And there was no //daridra,// because the //brāhmaṇa// was there. There was no question of //daridra.// Why do you pay the lawyers? Why do you say that "These people are living at our cost"? They're charging big, big fees. Why do you pay?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Thousands of dollars.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you pay? One man is earning ten rupees a day, but when there is some case, he is paying fifty rupees a day or fifty rupees per standing a lawyer. Why does he pay? So you say to them that "We are //brāhmaṇas.// The more you pay us, you'll be benefited." What do they say? That "You are living at the cost of others"?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Yes. We are taking from the society.

**Satsvarūpa:**
They don't recognize our activity as work, honest work.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Think we're cheating. Many people interrupt our book sales, saying, "These people are simply taking money."

**Prabhupāda:**
Where do they say? In your country?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Yes. They come, and they stop the sale: "Don't give him anything. He's cheating."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Gurukṛpā:**
"He's stealing from you." That is a great problem. We lose so many sales because of envious people stopping.

**Satsvarūpa:**
They say we're pretending to be a religion just to collect money, but our real aim is just to cheat, false propaganda. [horn beeps]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Child:**
Prabhupāda //ki jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya!// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Children:**
Prabhupāda //ki jaya!// Prabhupāda //ki jaya!//

**Devotees:**
[//kīrtana//] [end]
