[conversation takes place on the train at the station, with cries of vendors, etc.]

**Prabhupāda:**
"...prefer that I do not see the face of nondevotee."

**Hari-śauri:**
You quote that in the //Nectar of Devotion.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Actually, yes. This society, modern, it is very painful to see even their face. They have fallen so much down that by seeing their face you become polluted. Last night they disturbed so much. And they are happy.

**Hari-śauri:**
Actually they're not happy, but they make a show of happiness.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they think they're happy. They think they are very happy. They're enjoying life.

**Satsvarūpa:**
But we have to take the risk to go and see their face, to preach to them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But if you are engaged in preaching, you are not affected. [break] ...Himalaya just to avoid seeing the face of the vicious [indistinct].

**Satsvarūpa:**
In //Bhagavad-gītā// one of the items of knowledge is to go to a solitary place...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Satsvarūpa:**
...and avoid the congested...

**Prabhupāda:**
Practice //yoga//---solitary place, sacred and solitary. What is this circle we see in morning? Simply "//Chai, chai, chai.//" And cigarette, //biḍi,// and talking nonsense, drinking---no arrangement. Vedic system, still in India in morning they take bath, in the villages. In the cities also, those who come from village, you'll find in Bombay this side, many poor men, they're taking early in the morning bathing. You have seen that?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes, Juhu.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not only Juhu. Olee[?]. They'll wash their floor, take bath. In village also they'll go to the well and take water. [end]
