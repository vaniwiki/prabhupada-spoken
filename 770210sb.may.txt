**Pradyumna:**

> śrī-nārada uvāca...

[break] [leads chanting of synonyms] Translation: "The great saint Nārada Muni continued: The demigods, headed by Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva and other great demigods, dared not come forward before the Lord, who at that time was extremely angry."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Any more? Translation? Oh, you have done. Read the purport. Purport.

**Pradyumna:**
"Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung in his //Prema-bhakti-candrikā, 'krodha' bhakta-dveṣi jane:// anger should be used to punish a demon who is envious of devotees. //Kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada// and //mātsarya//---lust, anger, greed, illusion, pride and envy---all have their proper use for the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His devotee. A devotee of the Lord cannot tolerate blasphemy of the Lord or His other devotees, and the Lord also cannot tolerate blasphemy of a devotee. Thus Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva was so very angry that the great demigods like Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva and even the goddess of fortune, who is the Lord's constant companion, could not pacify Him, even after offering prayers of glorification and praise. No one was able to pacify the Lord in His anger, but because the Lord was willing to exhibit His affection for Prahlāda Mahārāja, all the demigods and the others present before the Lord pushed Prahlāda Mahārāja forward to pacify Him."

**Prabhupāda:**
So in the material world, //kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada// and //mātsarya,// these things are condemned. And for a //sādhana//[?], means a neophyte devotee, he is advised to give up these low-grade habits---//kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mada, mātsarya.// But people may question, "Wherefrom these low-grade qualities came?" //Kāma// is low grade, admitted, but wherefrom it came? In the //Vedānta-sūtra// we get the reply, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]: "Everything that we experience, it comes from God." So... [aside:] You stand that side. You are standing; they can stand.

So without the original source, even these low-grade things, wherefrom it comes? It comes from God. Just like //adharma,// irreligiosity, is described as the back side of God, and religiosity is described as the front side of God. So there is no difference between front side and back side---absolute. God is absolute any way. Even apart from God's body, even in our body, we do not make any distinction. Suppose if there is some trouble, if there is some boil here in the front side and if there is some boil in the back side, does it mean I shall not take care of the back side boil? I shall take care of it; I shall have treatment for it. I cannot neglect the back side boil because it has come out from the back side. There is no such reason.

So these bad habits, //kāma, krodha//---//kāma// means lust; //krodha// means anger---so if they are also coming from God, then how we can neglect it? How we can reject it? So there is no need of rejecting. That is the Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's... You cannot reject. That is not possible. As you are a living being, there must be //kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mātsarya.// You cannot reject it. You cannot make it zero. That is impersonalism. But it has its proper use. That you have to know. Unless you know the proper use of everything, everything... Proper use means it must be used for Kṛṣṇa. Then it is proper use. Otherwise it is misused. There is no such thing as bad. Everything is good when it is used for Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference between material and spiritual. Spiritual, everything is good, and material, everything is bad. You cannot make any distinction. When a thing is used materially it is bad. Therefore in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said, //dvaite bhadrābhadra sakali samāna. Dvaite//---means in this world of duality---everything is bad. They have invented some artificial meaning, "This is good, this is bad," but actually everything is bad in the material world. There is nothing good. And just the opposite: in the spiritual world, everything is good.

The other day I was giving the example that Kṛṣṇa is thief also---Mākhanaḥ-corā. And there is still in Remuṇā, Kṣīracorā. Kṣīracorā. He's famous, "The thief who stolen condensed milk." So this //corī// means stealing is there in Kṛṣṇa. Does it mean that it is bad? No. It is good. Because it is connected with Kṛṣṇa, it is good. Otherwise how people are worshiping a thief? And when it is used materially, when I steal something for my sense gratification, I am beaten with shoes. Then this is the distinction. Anything, bad or good, they are coming from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. //Ahaṁ-sarvasya prabhavaḥ:// "I am the origin of everything." So anything coming from Kṛṣṇa, how it can be bad? It cannot be bad. Absolute. Kṛṣṇa says personally, and //Vedānta// says, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]: "Absolute Truth is that from where everything is coming."

So the lust is also coming from Kṛṣṇa. We find lusty desire among the //gopīs,// among Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, recommends, //ramya kācid upāsana vrajavadhū kalpitā:// "There is no better mode of worship than it was conceived by the //vrajavadhū,// damsels of Vraja, Vṛndāvana, //parakīya-rasa.//" But in the material world Caitanya Mahāprabhu was so strict about women that once upon a time there was singing of woman in the Jagannātha temple, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu was running fast: "Oh, how nice singing is going on in the temple. Let Me go and hear." Then Govinda, His personal servant, checked Him: "My dear Sir, this singing is done by woman." "Oh? It is woman? Govinda, you have saved My life." Just see. And the same Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended about the //gopīs,// who loved Kṛṣṇa as paramour: //ramya kācid upāsana vrajavadhū-vargabhir ya kalpitā.// Just see the distinction. The same business is there, but it is all spiritual.

Therefore Absolute, everything is variegated, blissful. They do not understand. The //sahajiyā// means the blissful dealings, transcendental, spiritual dealings of //gopīs// and Kṛṣṇa, they take it as material. Therefore they are condemned. They are... It looks similar, but it is not the same thing. One is gold; one is iron. A polished iron, a golden thing, golden color, does not mean it is gold. "All that glitters is not gold." So we should not mistake. Therefore one who cannot distinguish the spiritual lust and the material lust, these should avoid very strictly. They have no spiritual realization. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has strictly avoided. In His //kīrtana// He never described the pastimes of Kṛṣṇa, His dealings with //gopīs.// That we mark in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Eighteen years He lived in Jagannātha Purī. Every night there was //kīrtana,// but there was no //līlā-kīrtana// you'll find, no //līlā-kīrtana.// Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all. No //līlā.// But does it mean that Kṛṣṇa..., Caitanya Mahāprabhu avoided //līlā-kīrtana?// No. He enjoyed it with very, very confidential devotees like Rāmānanda Rāya, Svarūpa Dāmodara, like that. Not public.

Because so long we are in the lower stage of devotion, we shall misunderstand. They are doing that. You'll find that these rascals who have no idea about Kṛṣṇa, they are very much fond of painting Kṛṣṇa's picture dealings with the //gopīs,// because they take it that it is just like we deal with young men or woman, it is something like that. So that is a great mistake. They should not. Then they will become //sahajiyā.// Very strictly prohibited. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// Śukadeva Gosvāmī has warned that one should not even dream like that, that "Kṛṣṇa's dealing with //gopīs// is just like our dealing with woman." No. It is completely different. Therefore we have to understand Kṛṣṇa. Vyāsadeva has devoted nine cantos to understand Kṛṣṇa, and then, in the Tenth Canto, he has put the //gopīs'// dealings with Kṛṣṇa. That is also beginning from twenty-ninth chapter.

So we should always know this, that lust is coming from Kṛṣṇa, but His lust, this lusty desire, and our lusty desire in the material world, they are not the same. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura advises, //kāmaḥ kṛṣṇa-kārmārpaṇe.// We have got lusty desires, but it should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa. Just like we are very much anxious to fulfill our lusty desires. So if we turn our lusty desire for serving Kṛṣṇa, we should be equally enthu... [break] [end]
