**Prabhupāda:**
...and actually for the benefit of the human society. They have no other desire.

**Hari-śauri:**
No, they can't stop this movement. It's not possible to stop this movement now.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is not possible. That I'm certain. It is advertising indirectly. [laughs]

**Hari-śauri:**
Will things get physically violent?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, the violence there may be. It doesn't matter.

**Hari-śauri:**
We should... If we have to, we can...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. We must... Self-protection must be there.

**Hari-śauri:**
Because now with these kidnappings it seems that we may have to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Fight!

**Hari-śauri:**
Then we'll have to fight.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Why not? Kill them.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. If we don't get protection from the government, then what can we do?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you must kill them. Tit for tat. As soon as we detect that "Here is a deprogrammer and kidnapper," kill him. Finish!

**Hari-śauri:**
And if we go to court, then it's self-defense.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. At least give him some good lesson. Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh, yes. Definitely.

**Prabhupāda:**
That should be done.

**Hari-śauri:**
We fought with demons once or twice before that have attacked the temple. We ought to give 'em a good hiding.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is civil war. Why not this?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. This is... This is a big fight now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
[laughs] You're the world's greatest revolutionary. [Prabhupāda laughs] [break] Now that we're being attacked like this physically...

**Prabhupāda:**
So we must attack them also.

**Hari-śauri:**
Should we actually have a training program, so that our...

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Hari-śauri:**
... we'd know how to defend? Like you were saying //varṇāśrama...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
...system there must be //kṣatriya// and everything like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
Should we actually start to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Train.

**Hari-śauri:**
...train up some of our men so they know how to fight?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, why not?

**Hari-śauri:**
'Cause we have men who know how to use guns. They practice a little. But on the whole, our devotees don't... They're not...

**Prabhupāda:**
They are not trained up.

**Hari-śauri:**
...trained up to be able to defend themselves, and these people are professional //guṇḍās.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That...? What is that? "Kirat?" They practice self-defense?

**Hari-śauri:**
Karate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Karate.

**Hari-śauri:**
There's different forms of self-defense. [end]
