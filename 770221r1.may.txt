**Prabhupāda:**
...and //asura// means //tad-viparyaya,// just the opposite. So anyone... [break] ...Kṛṣṇa, he's a demon. //Viṣṇu-bhakto bhaved daivaḥ. Daiva// means //devatā.// So there are two classes---//daiva asura eva ca:// one //devatā// and one //asura.// One who is devotee, he is //devatā.// One who is not devotee, he's //asura.// That's all---in different names. So our this movement is making the //asuras// to become //devatā.// This is our movement. This is, therefore, the most prominent welfare activities within the human society. We are trying to make demon to become //devatā.// And actually they are becoming. The demons are becoming //devatā.// Is it not?

**Devotees:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [laughing]

**Prabhupāda:**
And the so-called education, they are making //devatā// demons. We want to check it. The human being, he has got the opportunity. Human being is there to become a //devatā.// Therefore the Vedic knowledge is there. Because he's coming from lower species of life, and they also admit they are coming from monkey. That's all right. But now make him man really. Where is that arrangement? You are keeping him monkey, jumping like monkey. That's all. So your, this so-called educational system, society, is good, or we are making the monkey to become to become //devatā,// this is good? What they will say? You have come from monkey, and now we are making them //devatā.// So this is a good process? Or you keep them as monkey, jumping like here and there, that is good? //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// That is the way to make a monkey to become a demigod, or //devatā.// This is the Vedic injunction. "Now you should make him, this monkey, person coming from monkey, or a monkey, make him a //devatā.//" And Caitanya Mahāprabhu has simplified: "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. You become //devatā. Bās.//" What do you want more? Actually that is becoming. //Kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and from monkey you become a //devatā,// demigod. What do you want more? Therefore He's //mahā-vadānyāvatāra,// the most munificent incarnation, making monkey to //devatā// simply by chanting. See practically. Hmm? Anyone protesting against this? [devotees laugh] Here is mother of our Jayapatākā Mahārāja. She is attracted how the situation is nice. Now she wants to take instruction from her son as mother Devahūti took instruction from her son, Kapiladeva. So...

**Jayapatākā's mother:**
I have some questions for him already.

**Prabhupāda:**
Your son could not answer the questions?

**Jayapatākā's mother:**
I will see him this evening. I'll see him this evening.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, your son will be able to answer all questions. Like Devahūti, you can take instruction from your son. That is in the history. Son is instructing mother. Generally mother instructs the son, but there is history the son is instructing mother. Because here we make such relationship---mother, father, son, daughter, relative. Actually this is material nature made, in different bodies. Otherwise, real father is Kṛṣṇa. [devotees exclaim as lights go out] This is the benefit of modern science, [laughter] [Prabhupāda laughs] that in the evening you require light---there is no light in the evening. When you require, there is no light. Better depend on the natural oil. [pause]

**Bhāgavata:**
In Satya-yuga or Tretā-yuga they would not drill for petrol to use to make electricity or to make these gas lamps, so by what means did they use to light the palaces and the kingdoms? What was the natural resource utilized for that purpose?

**Prabhupāda:**
This oil. You produce castor seed oil. You grow castor seed by agricultural.

**Bhāgavata:**
Grow cas...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Castor seed.

**Bhāgavata:**
Castor seed. Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, and you get sufficient oil.

**Bhāgavata:**
And that was used, castor seed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Instead of one cand..., one lamp, hundred candlepower, if you want more light you just have hundred castor seed lamps. That's all. It will look beautiful, and there'll be light. You'll find it, if you bring one hundred castor seed lamps, it will look very nice, and the light is there. [end]
