**Bali-mardana:**
Yeah. They call it "the train." It's bigger than a train.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, rooms are nice?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. They're not quite complete, but it's very comfortable.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I am requesting you that from India you take books and distribute, and in exchange, half the money you send us in powdered milk and //ghee.//

**Bali-mardana:**
Hmm. Yes, I am prepared to order all the hardbound books from India. I've already ordered forty thousand //Bhagavad-gītās// and some four or five thousand //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatams.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So make this arrangement.

**Bali-mardana:**
But how will we arrange that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, there's no problem. In other words, as long as we can get the import license... We'll be able to get an import license.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, one thing can be done.

**Hari-śauri:**
I don't know how they're going to do it.

**Bali-mardana:**
Gopāla wants me to make LCs for the books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
LCs?

**Bali-mardana:**
Letter of credits. I have to open a letter of credit for the full amount.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So if he can get permission... Gopāla has to get permission from Delhi that instead, fifty percent will be paid in the form of these milk products.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He just has to get permission from Delhi. That's all. Once he gets permission, there should be no problem.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. I can work it out with Gopāla. It is no problem.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
From your end you can arrange.

**Bali-mardana:**
There's no difficulty. They will be glad to export //ghee.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So wherever we have got center in India, just like this Mahesh Pandit, if we supply them //channa dhāl// and //puri// and //halavā// and nice, what is called, //puṣpānna,// his great-grandfather will come to eat.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Wow. They'll give up all their fish-eating, that whole community.

**Prabhupāda:**
So from this milk powder we can make this //chānā// and //dahī,// and //ghee// is there.

**Bali-mardana:**
//Chānā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Cheese.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cheese. And you produce in the farm, milk, and utilize and give the cows protection.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. I was thinking that we should not increase the cows too many in the beginning...

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Bali-mardana:**
...because I want to make sure they are maintained nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Maintain means fodder. Grow fodder. They will eat that leaf.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Got a good cow man there?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. A boy's had experience. There shouldn't be... There is no problem. New Zealand also. We can either export from Australia or New Zealand. New Zealand is also very..., maybe even a little cheaper, but the shipping might put them off.

**Hari-śauri:**
New Zealand milk products are very cheap.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, very cheap.

**Bali-mardana:**
Where should we send? To one center?

**Prabhupāda:**
Send in Bombay.

**Bali-mardana:**
Send to Bombay, and they can stock and then supply everywhere.

**Hari-śauri:**
They have some exp... Balarāma already knows about sending //ghee.// I think he knows how.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. I was just investigating it. They wanted some //ghee// in Hawaii.

**Hari-śauri:**
They've already done two or three shipments to India before, so that's already established.

**Bali-mardana:**
No problem.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
International cooperation.

**Prabhupāda:**
For making devotees.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not for business.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No.

**Bali-mardana:**
And the books are nice quality. No problem.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have seen?

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, very nice.

**Bali-mardana:**
Very nice quality.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now //Bhāgavatam// will be there.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yeah. Any volume we want, they are prepared to print. We simply give them the volume. They will print.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, because he is giving such a big order that they can print the whole printing even for him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Five thousand they can print.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah, Gopāla's said in India...

**Prabhupāda:**
And in Hyderabad let us produce grains. The grains, milk, //ghee//---then we can maintain hundreds and thousands of devotees in any place. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take nice food.

**Bali-mardana:**
I know that Australia has been shipping some cows to India for increasing milk production, so we can also investigate that. If we have a farm in Hyderabad...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
...that might be productive.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. They can eat all the grains. There's so much grains produced there.

**Bali-mardana:**
And the cows can give better milk and //ghee.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Arrange all this. Our philosophy is "Eat nicely, live nicely and advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness." First problem is eating. That we shall supply, no problem. Eating and clothing we shall give. And shelter. Make this propaganda. They put this logic, "If we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, who shall earn? Who will earn for us?" The Indians, they do that. Rascals, they do that. They do not know Kṛṣṇa provides. So we give them that "You... I give you shelter, food, cloth. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa."

**Bali-mardana:**
Full program.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Everything provided. Wherever we open these farming communities, people then, they respect us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
They say, "Oh, you are doing something."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Kṛṣṇa's order, //kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. [break] ...not that the learned //brāhmaṇa// class is important and //śūdra,// he is not im... He is also important. He is giving you service according to his quality. //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. And center is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I think from Africa also they can send, because...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Milk products. Yeah, they had great milk products when I was there.

**Indian devotee:**
Very good cows there.

**Bali-mardana:**
We should investigate from Argentina. He said it was very cheap.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But now we're not in Argentina anymore.

Bali-mardana: Oh, [indistinct].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Amsterdam.

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall regain again.

**Bali-mardana:**
The government there is changing every few months, new government.

**Prabhupāda:**
If you can introduce this system, //varṇāśrama,// then it will establish. No more change. This is a rascal's government, this democracy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Demoncracy."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Demoncracy."

**Hari-śauri:**
"Demon-crazy."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Demon-crazy." [laughter] Demon and crazy. Not only demon... There are demons whose brain is all right, but they are crazy also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[laughing] Demon-crazy.

**Prabhupāda:**
And introduce books in the school, colleges, libraries---so nice books. There is no doubt about it, there is no such literature throughout the world.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Gradually some of the people are beginning to understand what you're up to, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Some of these big demons in America especially, they are beginning to understand that you are the most dangerous personality in the world to them.

**Prabhupāda:**
To kill "demon-crazy," LSD. [laughs] Yes, that is my mission. That is Kṛṣṇa's mission, //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]], to kill all these demon, crazy demon. I have no such power; otherwise I would have killed them. Either establish Kṛṣṇa conscious government or kill them---//bās,// finish. I would have done that, violence.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, when good argument fails...

**Prabhupāda:**
Kill them. Finish. Just like Paraśurāma did. Kill all them, twenty-one times.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, Paraśurāma. I was just reading in that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
...8.3. Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
No consideration. Kill them. Due to Paraśurāma, the //kṣatriyas// went to European side, fled away. From India either they were driven away or killed when they become inconsistent with Vedic rules. So these //kṣatriyas// and associates... These parts of the world were resided by aborigines, mean uncivilized class. So for so many years associated with them, they have learned killing the an... Otherwise they're Aryans.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Fallen Aryan culture.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bās.// They have fallen.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But you are raising them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
This center here is so wonderful, the //prasādam// hall and grass...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
..and flowers. Everything is there. Fruits and buildings.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can develop similar places. Land is so cheap.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, yes. Australia...

**Hari-śauri:**
There's so much land in Australia, it's just...

**Bali-mardana:**
Soon as we have our center...

**Prabhupāda:**
In Africa also, land is cheap. Give this civilization. Then our mission will be... The African people are nice. Everywhere they are nice. These rascal leaders make them bad. In Russia also they have nice people. This, a few rascals, they are controlling the government.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Leaders are bad all over the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dangerous.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
America also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere the mass people is good. We know it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This //prasādam// and chanting will cure them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It will capture the masses.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So do this.

**Bali-mardana:**
In Australia, Prabhupāda, the people, they love //prasādam.// We had a program. They did one alternative life-style festival, and the people lined up for three hours, waiting for the //prasādam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see.

**Bali-mardana:**
Over a thousand people. And then when they ate they came back for seconds and thirds.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Give them.

**Bali-mardana:**
Everything. //Purī, sabjī,// sweet rice. They ate the whole plate. It was amazing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Please do that. Give them //prasādam// and ask them to chant. //Bās.//

**Bali-mardana:**
And then there were many articles written in the paper that "The Hare Kṛṣṇas, they have supplied very nice food freely for everyone," and they said, "Oh, they are very good."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The thing is, when they take //prasādam,// then it's very easy to get them to chant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They may not chant in the beginning, but as soon as their bellies are full of //prasādam,// then they chant.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] They chant. Very good. Do that.

**Bali-mardana:**
We have a bus. They travel all over just for distributing //prasādam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, on this subject matter, you GBC decide how to do it and do it practically.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is the real business of talking.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. How the supply will come, and everything, make program and do that. There will be no difficulty. Kṛṣṇa will supply you everything. No difficulty. Actually Kṛṣṇa is supplying. Now we are known all over the world, "very rich." Is it not?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] "Fabulously rich."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Fabulously rich," they say in Parliament.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I started... Was I rich?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Forty rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] Wherefrom...? Forty rupees. So it is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. So if we work sincerely, Kṛṣṇa will supply us.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That point we have seen proven more than anything else. You've always said this, and more and more, Kṛṣṇa is supplying everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is, after all, Kṛṣṇa's. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. It is His property. As soon as He sees that "Here is My real servant. Give him all facility." It is stated in the... //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. You know? //Nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham// [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]]. //Teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham.// Everything is there.

**Hari-śauri:**
[reading] //Ananyāś cintayanto mām...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ananyāś cinta...// Simply you have to think how to execute Kṛṣṇa's program. //Ananyāś cintayanto mām?//

**Hari-śauri:**
//Ye janāḥ paryupāsate.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ye janāḥ paryupāsate:// "One who has dedicated his life for this program," //teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānām,// "because he is twenty-four hours engaged," //yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham// [[books:bg:9:22|[Bg. 9.22]]]. Clear. Purport? Read.

**Hari-śauri:**
Translation: "Those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form, to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have." Purport: "One who is unable to live for a moment without Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot but think of Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours, being engaged in devotional service by hearing, chanting, remembering, offering prayers, worshiping, serving the lotus feet of the Lord, rendering other services, cultivating friendship and surrendering fully to the Lord. Such activities are all-auspicious and full of spiritual potency. Indeed, they make the devotee perfect in self-realization. Then his only desire is to achieve the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called //yoga.// By the mercy of the Lord such a devotee never comes back to this material condition of life. //Kṣema// refers to the merciful protection of the Lord. The Lord helps the devotee to achieve Kṛṣṇa consciousness by //yoga,// and when he becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, the Lord protects him from falling down to a miserable conditioned life."

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not do this business, guaranteed by Kṛṣṇa?

**Bali-mardana:**
By your grace it is all possible. By your grace.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [laughs] You do this.

**Bali-mardana:**
I think the potency is all coming from you.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is there. I am simply trying to place before you. That's all. I believe, and that is my qualification. It is not that I doubt. No. You can say that is my qualification. //Asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. Find out this verse. //Asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes, beginning of the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Seventh Chapter.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Seventh Chapter. "Without doubt, free from doubt."

**Bali-mardana:**
Hmm. "Now hear, free from doubt."

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes.

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

"Now hear, O son..."

**Prabhupāda:**
//J-ñ-a// means "//gya//" or "//jña.//"

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh. Either one can be said, "//jña,//" or "//gya.//"

**Hari-śauri:**
//Jñāsyasi.// "Now hear, O son of Pṛthā, Arjuna, how by practicing //yoga// in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt."

**Bali-mardana:**
Hmm. One must become free from all doubt.

**Prabhupāda:**
And then?

**Bali-mardana:**
You always said because you had faith in the words of your Guru Mahārāja, therefore...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau// [//ŚU// 6.23]. Similar surrender to //guru. Yathā deve,// as you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, similar to //guru//---then your life is perfect. //Yathā deve tathā gurau, tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakāśante.// Then this meaning of the scripture will be revealed automatically. And you are singing daily, //guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete kariyā aikya, āra nā kariha mane āśā.// Nothing more. Then your life is perfect. This is secret. //Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete kariyā aikya, āra nā kariha mane āśā.// Don't manufacture ideas, rascal. Then it is finished. In material world everyone is a demon-crazy. Everyone is manufacturing ideas. And they are suffering. All rascals are manufacturing ideas. //Kartāham iti manyate. Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. He's fully under control of the laws of nature, and he's thinking, "I am independent. I can manufacture ideas." //Āḍhyo 'ham...// That is... Find out this. //Āḍhyo 'ham janavān asmi ko 'nyo 'sti,// some like that, in the Sixteenth Chapter. "Demon-crazy." Crazy demons are thinking like that. [chuckles] "I can manufacture something. I am very intelligent. We..."

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
The three verses together?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you find out. There's so many. The mentality of the demon-crazy...

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah, how he's thinking. That verse that describes how he's thinking.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
"So much is mine today..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Hari-śauri:**

> idam adya mayā labdham
> imaṁ prāpsye...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Punar dhanam.//

**Hari-śauri:**

> ...manoratham
> idam astīdam api me
> bhaviṣyati punar dhanam

> asau mayā hataḥ śatrur
> haniṣye cāparān api
> īśvaro 'ham ahaṁ bhogī
> siddho 'haṁ balavān sukhī
> [[books:bg:16:13|[Bg. 16.13-14]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is...

**Hari-śauri:**

> āḍhyo 'bhijanavān asmi
> ko 'nyo 'sti sadṛśo mayā
> yakṣye dāsyāmi modiṣya
> ity ajñāna-vimohitāḥ
> [[books:bg:16:15|[Bg. 16.15]]]

"The demoniac person thinks, 'So much wealth do I have today, and I will gain more according to my schemes. So much is mine now, and it will increase in the future more and more. He is my enemy, and I have killed him, and my other enemy will also be killed. I am the lord of everything. I am the enjoyer. I am perfect, powerful and happy. I am the richest man, surrounded by aristocratic relatives. There is none so powerful and happy as I am. I shall perform sacrifice, I shall give some charity, and thus I shall rejoice.' In this way such persons are deluded by ignorance."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Then he gets a toothache and it's all finished. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The rascal Sai Baba says, "I am God."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now it seems that they have detected him for sure. He's really becoming publicly denounced now, all over the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes. They were saying, those two Bengali gentlemen this morning, the film producers, were saying that the scholars here now and some of the newspaper people are beginning to expose, that "This is a complete cheater. This Sai Baba is cheating, and why are the innocent people falling for him? What kind of fool is he that he says he's God?" It's a good thing that they're exposing him, because he was the most acclaimed so-called "//bhagavān//" of them all. He is the most respected around India of all of these bogus //gurus.//

**Bali-mardana:**
Now all the other //gurus// have faded away. You are...

**Hari-śauri:**
There's only you left, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Bali-mardana:**
You're the only one left. All the bogus //gurus// have faded away. The Maharishi...

**Prabhupāda:**
That Sadaji Vitlal has said that "Bhaktivedanta Swami... [Hindi]"

**Bali-mardana:**
What is that?

**Hari-śauri:**
"Blackened everybody else's face."

**Prabhupāda:**
He said. [laughing]

**Hari-śauri:**
"Blackened the face of all the other //yogīs.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] He said that. [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And coming from him it's especially relishable, because he used to criticize you for denouncing all of them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Means he's an intelligent businessman. [laughing] He can understand. He's the disciple of Chinmayananda. But he has realized that "What Chinmayananda is before Bhaktivedanta Swami?" That he realizes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He used to criticize Prabhupāda. He used to tell me, "Your Guru Mahārāja is always denouncing all the other //gurus// in public."

**Prabhupāda:**
Now he is doing that, [laughs] following me.

**Hari-śauri:**
Actually, you're very well known for criticizing everybody else.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Uncompromising.

**Prabhupāda:**
My Guru Mahārāja was also alone. And why not? All these rascals, why shall I call him intelligent?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You give them no credit.

**Prabhupāda:**
How can I give them? //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]: "Anyone who has not fully surrendered to..., he is this, //duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ.//" That's a fact. Just see. This man has got some intelligence. He's simply cheating. This is //duṣkṛtina.// He should have preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He has got intelligence. He has created a position, means this is intelligent. But that intelligence he's applying for declaring himself as God. Therefore //duṣkṛtina.// Intelligence being used for some bad purpose. He's not God. Cheating purpose. He knows it. Everyone knows that he does not know. But he is using his intelligence for some bad purpose for making some temporary position. How rascal he is. He's not God. Suppose he is accepted as God. But he is imitation or cheating God. How long it will go on? But he's such a rascal he does not know that. //Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. Therefore //mūḍha.// For few years, suppose he remains so-called God. And what is the benefit? Next life he may become a dog. What is the benefit? Therefore //mūḍha. Māyā-sukhāya, indriyārtham. Indriyārtha-māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. Hmm? For sense gratification for a few years, and make such gorgeous cheating process. Therefore he's rascal. He does not know the value of his eternal life, how he is going to become a dog next life. He knows, but he doesn't care. He's such a rascal. For temporary happiness, men and woman, er, woman and money.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīm// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. He doesn't care.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. They are... And woman and money, that will not solve the problems of our life.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No. They increase the problems of life.

**Hari-śauri:**
They //are// the problems of life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Even bird and beast, they can get woman.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who?

**Bali-mardana:**
Birds and beast.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have seen. I have studied this cricket [cricket sounds in room], that come for...[Prabhupāda taps on desk] Two of, the male and female.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. And every morning you can see these sparrows...

**Prabhupāda:**
Every.

**Hari-śauri:**
...very busy making nests.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere. This male and female, nature's gift that is. Therefore //tasyaiva hetoḥ.// These things you'll get.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. So why use the...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why you are after these things?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hmm. Wasting human life.

**Prabhupāda:**
You'll get woman. So be satisfied, the nature's gift of woman, nature's gift of your position, and utilize your life for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why more and more, more, and naked and this way and that way? The other day what did I say? Vagina-licking civilization.

**Bali-mardana:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Vagina-licking civilization.

**Prabhupāda:**
They're spending so much money for vagina-looking.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, that's their whole consciousness.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The money is earned with so hard labor and it is spent for vagina-looking.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Polished dog society.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes, dog also smells the vagina, and they also do the same thing. Therefore nature has arranged that dog are smelling vagina on the street. One vagina, and three dozen dogs surrounded.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Vṛndāvana you see that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now that's going on in America. They are spending money just for that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Three dozen men look at one woman. Same business.

**Bali-mardana:**
And they make big literatures, magazines, everywhere, all over the streets. They put them in the street...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The big thing now in America, the most popular shop, is called "Adult Books." "Adult Bookshop."

**Hari-śauri:**
"Adult cinema," "adult this," "adult that."

**Prabhupāda:**
Topless, bottomless.

**Hari-śauri:**
Brainless.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tucchaṁ kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham, tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. //Bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ. Kṛpaṇa,// the rascals. //Kṛpaṇa// means non-//brāhmaṇa,// without any spiritual knowledge. They are never satisfied, the vagina business. //Tṛpyanti neha kṛp//---although it is followed by so much miserable condition---//bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ, kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁ viṣaheta dhīraḥ.// One who is //dhīra,// sober, he tolerates little itching sensation: "What this nonsense?" And if you practice toleration, there will be no more. Finished. You become liberated. Therefore, from the very beginning of life, childhood, this teach him, that "Don't be a vagina-smelling animal." //Brahmacārī. Brahmacārī guru-gṛhe vasan dāntaḥ.// To learn how to control the senses, that is //brahmacārī.// Where is that civilization? So establish. Give them food. Give them shelter. Give them knowledge. That is //para-upakāra,// doing welfare to others. But don't be entangled in vagina civilization. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. It is most abominable civilization, //tuccham,// condemned civilization.

**Bali-mardana:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Hari-śauri:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do this, what is my idea I have given. Hmm. Yes. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They don't understand.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Apareyam...// [break] ...inferior. These rascals, they do not know. The superior thing they do not know. They are simply entangled in this material, inferior. Psychologist, psychiatrist. [sound of evening shenai] Now there is moon. Intelligence. Intelligence, I think, they take it as soul. Therefore they say that the animal has no soul.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But an animal has intelligence. An animal also has some small degree of intelligence.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You were saying the cows, when they know that there is something there, they stay away.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. They can understand that "These people are going to kill us," "These people will not kill us." They can understand. You know that when I was in America some incident took place, that some slaughterhouse livestock, the..., somehow or other, it was open, and they were fleeing away, going away. Something happened. They were going up on the slaughterhouse, and some of them were shooted.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The cows were running away?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Unless they could understand that "We are kept here for being slaughtered," why they were running away?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They speak of peace. Such nonsense. How can they expect peace when they're slaughtering?

**Prabhupāda:**
All do. It is very, very demons', the Western civilization. No social structure, no mercy. All good qualities devoid. Simply animals in good dress. That's all. [end]
