</audio>

[First 28 minutes of audio is talk between 2 interviewers and Prabhupada in Hindi, discussing, among other things, books produced in other languages. A few English words interjected.]

**Interviewer (1):**
Come closer.

**Prabhupāda:**
They were the first recruits.

**Interviewer (1):**
Ah, they were the first conscious people of the Western world. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Brahmānanda:**
We were the first to dance to the name of Kṛṣṇa.

**Interviewer (1):**
But how do you feel when...

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Interviewer (1):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Brahmānanda:**
It was the first major article written about Prabhupāda when he came. Prabhupāda started his //kīrtana// in a park in New York City. When Prabhupāda came, he did not bring any //mṛdaṅga,// so one of his students gave him some small drum, with only one head, one drum, and he was playing, and...

**Prabhupāda:**
That picture I am playing.

**Interviewer (1):**
Sidney Shengal[?] he was very good friend of us.

**Brahmānanda:**
Shubra?

**Interviewer (1):**
Shengal.

**Brahmānanda:**
Shengal.

**Interviewer (1):**
Several times he was in India. Couple of years.

**Brahmānanda:**
Who? What is his position? He's a writer? Or an editor?

**Interviewer:**
Shengal[?] is an editor. He is on the editor writing.

**Interviewer (2):**
No, no, no. He was in Singapore. [Hindi]

**Interviewer (1):**
No, no, no. He was editor. He was acting editor of //New York Times.//

**Interviewer (2):**
He has written books.

**Interviewer (1):**
Maybe now he’s written a book, but he’s local editor. [Hindi] Delhi correspondent.

**Brahmānanda:**
That paper's very favorable to our movement.

**Interviewer:**
I see.

**Brahmānanda:**
Throughout all these years, they've always written very favorable articles, positive.

**Interviewer:**
I think //New York Times// must be one of the most spiritual places in the States. [Hindi]

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes. We've been covered with very extensive type[?]. We've been certified to be the most widely publicized...

**Interviewer:**
Yeah.

**Brahmānanda:**
...of all.

**Interviewer:**
All temples.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes. For sure. It was a very famous paper.

**Prabhupāda:**
In America, Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement is known, household.

**Brahmānanda:**
Household.

**Prabhupāda:**
So also in Europe.

**Brahmānanda:**
Whole of Europe.

**Interviewer:**
Why they react so favorably in the materialistic world?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, I think they are impressed by our..., the purity of this Movement. We follow four regulative principles: prohibited from intoxication---even cigarettes, coffee, tea, alcohol, drugs---illicit sex, meat-eating and gambling. So other //gurus// who have come to the West, they don't say these things. Rather, they say you can..., first you can meditate, then you can go ahead and do these things. They don't prohibit.

**Prabhupāda:**
They say, "Why should we prohibit? Lord has given you senses. Enjoy."

**Brahmānanda:**
They even say that "Do not restrict yourself in any way." So people actually don't respect them. They may think it's popular, but they don't respect it. So our movement is preaching these principles, and in conjunction we have many books, very respectable books. We're getting reviews---very favorable reviews---from big scholars, all universities. Even now Prabhupāda's books are being used as textbooks in major universities. So this gives a...

**Interviewer:**
Anywhere in Europe?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes.

**Interviewer:**
Take books.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes. They've been in Europe. They've been all over---Scandinavia, France, Germany...

**Interviewer (2):**
London?

**Brahmānanda:**
London. We have favorable reviews from Oxford, all the big universities. We've published a booklet, and we can give you a copy.

**Prabhupāda:**
These are reviews of our books.

**Interviewer:**
[indistinct]

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. So many reviews. This is one review from a Harvard scholar. Harvard.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Can you get it? [brings in pictures]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is in Los Angeles?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes. There are 300 of these, all totaled, like this one.

**Brahmānanda:**
Framed like this?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Three hundred?

**Brahmānanda:**
Three hundred.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes. Plus these.

**Brahmānanda:**
These are pictures, for being displayed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
For the downstairs.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
This is an award from a books fair in America, "Excellence."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Says, "Printing Industries of Metropolitan New York, Certificate of Special Merit for outstanding example of printing displayed in the Bicentennial Exhibition of Printing, 1976, presented to Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta...//"

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] printing [Hindi with reporters]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Lord Caitanya’s Ratha-yātrā...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Caitanya-caritāmṛta...// [Hindi]

**Brahmānanda:**
This is the volume that won the prize.

**Interviewer:**
[Hindi]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
There’s Bengali script. There’s an [indistinct]. [indistinct background comments] This is a Swedish //Back to Godhead.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Swedish? I have not seen it before. Sweden language [Hindi]. These pictures, framed there or here?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Framed in Los Angeles and shipped here.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
A few broke---not many.

**Prabhupāda:**
Broke...

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
The glass.

**Prabhupāda:**
...glass

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
They can be repaired later.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yesterday I see pictures?

**Brahmānanda:**
Of Berkeley...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [Hindi with interviewers] Berkeley, San Francisco.

**Interviewer:**
Berkeley.

[Prabhupāda and interviewers talk briefly in Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is a total of books printed, at our press.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [Prabhupāda and interviewer talk in Hindi about architecture of temples]

**Brahmānanda:**
They came to India and took photographs of the Indian temples here and studied very carefully. The Berkeley temple is known as New Jagannātha Purī.

**Interviewer:**
New Jagannātha Purī. //Ācchā.//

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. It was the scene of our first...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ratha-yātrā.

**Brahmānanda:**
...Ratha-yātrā festival.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Interviewer:**
//Ācchā.// [Hindi]

**Brahmānanda:**
In Berkeley.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Near San Francisco.

**Brahmānanda:**
New Jagannātha Purī.

[Prabhupāda and interviewers converse in Hindi]

**Interviewer:**
New Jagannātha Temple.

**Brahmānanda:**
Purī.

**Interviewer:**
New Jagannātha Purī. //Ācchā.//

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
Just like there is New England, New York...

**Interviewer:**
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

**Brahmānanda:**
...New Amsterdam. So Prabhupāda has named "New Jagannātha Purī." Berkeley is of..., the scene of the Berkeley University, where every year the students there become very unruly and they make some riots and so on. But when we have our Ratha-yātrā parade, we go right where these students are, and there's never any fighting or rioting, and the police have given a certificate, that "Your Society... We commend your Society because when you have your demonstration at Ratha-yātrā it is very peaceful and it gives us no trouble."

**Prabhupāda:**
And not only that, last year---not last year, but year before last---when I was coming, riding in the car, all the students surrounded me, and---you remember that?---"Thank you, Prabhupāda. Thank you, Prabhupāda." They are not my students, they're outsiders, but still they have received it, and they said this word: "Thank you, Prabhupāda." They're getting a life, new life.

**Interviewer:**
Yeah. Actually, this movement is a movement of the youth.

**Brahmānanda:**
That is our great confidence in the future of this movement---it’s the young people that’re taking it up; so therefore we’re progressing the movement.

**Interviewer:**
How the young, the younger generation in the other countries, they're taking...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere.

**Interviewer:**
European countries?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Maybe I should give them... These... This is the total number of books we have printed in various different languages, and they’ll give you an indication of how our movement is being accepted around the world: In the English-speaking countries we've published a total of forty-three and a half million books. Forty-three and a half million. In Spanish-speaking countries---this is in copies of books---Spanish, three million; in German, two and a quarter million copies of books. In Japanese the same number, two and one quarter million; in French, one and three quarter million copies.

**Interviewer:**
Three quarter million.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One and three quarter million. 

**Interviewer:**
One and...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One point seven million. In Portuguese, one million copies---that means Brazil and Portugal. Dutch...

**Interviewer:**
Dutch.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...six //lakhs// copies; Italian, five //lakhs// copies; then Chinese, fifty-five thousand copies; Korean, twenty thousand copies; Yugoslavian, twenty thousand copies; Polish, ten thousand copies; Hungarian, ten thousand copies; Czechoslovakian, ten thousand copies; Russian, five thousand copies. Total, fifty-five million copies of books.

**Interviewer:**
Total.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Fifty-five million.

**Brahmānanda:**
The Russian books...We are of course not able to distribute in Russia, because they don't allow religion; the way our men distributed, that they are trained to travel between Finland and Russia. So the men get on the trains---because the trains go up to the border, coming from the border of Russia---they sell them to the Russian people...

**Interviewer:**
I see.

**Brahmānanda:**
...but not inside Russia. In this way the people bring the books back with them. In this way we're getting books into Russia.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So these books, the books that we have printed, are //Bhagavad-gītā//---the numbers I have given you are for //Bhagavad-gītā//---//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...// You can say //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,// because our //Bhagavad-gītās// special name, "As It Is."

**Interviewer:**
"As it is."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//...Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// and many other books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see how our books are reprinted, and here is one list.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Just see how it's increasing in every year, in many languages. The //Bhagavad-gītā//---this is worthy of note---that this year we are printing //Bhagavad-gītā:// one million five hundred thousand copies in English.

**Prabhupāda:**
See how much we printed.

**Brahmānanda:**
We’re printing history.

**Prabhupāda:**
It has nothing to do what I printed in India.

**Brahmānanda:**
This is the first book Prabhupāda printed, before coming to America. He came with this book, printed in India.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Course, we have printed many //lakhs// copies of books in India also---I did not give you totals---but we are printing in many Indian languages: Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Gujarati, Marathi... One other I didn't tell you is Swahili...

**Interviewer:**
Swahili, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...one hundred thousand copies---one //lakh.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Any new book we print, not less than twenty //lakhs.// Then increases it to fifty //lakhs.//

**Interviewer:**
In India, who publishes these books?

**Prabhupāda:**
India, now we are publishing Usha Printing.

**Interviewer:**
So you’re just giving to the States[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That is a small press in Delhi. [indistinct background discussion as guests look at books] Now we are changing the format---more attractive. You have got //Bhāgavatam?//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. [background discussion about new covers]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
This is //Perfection of Yoga,// which is taken from //Bhagavad-gītā,// essays on //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
We are the first, number-one publisher of these books in religious subject in the world.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
They’re all of Krsna culture.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These are three new covers... This is a... [break] People treat these books as holy scriptures. They don't take these books as ordinary. They keep them in special places on their bookshelves. And many people have become full-time Vaiṣṇavas simply from purchasing these books. They have become so much impressed with the philosophy that they have dedicated their life to Lord Caitanya after reading these books.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
In the English language alone Śrīla Prabhupāda has printed sufficient books that one out of every five people in the United States can have a copy.

[Prabhupāda and interviewers discuss briefly in Hindi]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Our recent order for //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,// we had to order the paper to print it, so it required seventy-six cars on the train to carry it to the printer.

**Tamala Kṛṣṇa:**
I think that’s worthy of mentioning in the newspaper.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Seventy-six ox carts.

**Brahmānanda:**
Wagons. Seventy-six wagons, full of paper.

**Prabhupāda:**
For printing one book.

**Interviewer:**
Fantastic! I don't think these people know about the world so much, for the publications. They know about the [indistinct]. In the West, Prabhupāda’s books.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
The paper company, which is one of the largest in the world, sent us one letter---it will be here in a week---stating that this is the largest paper order ever made for one book in history.

**Tamala Kṛṣṇa:**
Phew!

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Any book.

**Interviewer:**
This is in the States?

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
United States. And the printer for that particular book said he has never heard of one single order for a hardbound book being that large.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One million, five hundred thousand copies.

**Interviewer:**
One million, five hundred thousand.

**Tamala Kṛṣṇa:**
//Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.//

**Brahmānanda:**
Now we are starting to reprint the books here in India and exporting. This //Bhagavad-gītā// is published here, printed here in India, and it's being exported to UK, Australia and other countries. This is printed in Bombay.

**Interviewer:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bombay is the center of our publication of books.

**Interviewer:**
This is Ramachandra's[?] Press?

**Brahmānanda:**
No. Usha.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ramachandra's is in Delhi.

**Interviewer:**
Punjabi.

**Brahmānanda:**
Now Usha Press is going to establish a special press---they're going to import a special printing press machine---and it's going to be established somewhere in Gujarat, where the government has given one area only for export industries; and therefore they will be getting certain tax benefits. So everything that they print there must be exported---they cannot use it in the country. So this is specifically for our printing needs.

**Prabhupāda:**
We get paper from government and publish.

**Interviewer:**
Oh, from the government of India.

**Interviewer (2):**
Then why they're encouraging on one hand and they're discouraging the other hand to do something

**Prabhupāda:**
They have got different department, encouraging and discouraging....

[others all laugh] You know better than me.

**Interviewer:**
Uh?

**Prabhupāda:**
You know better than me. Discouraging department; encouraging. And we are concerned with both departments.

**Interviewer (2):**
Such a [indistinct] department.

**Interviewer:**
How can I get some of your books? We take and write a special article on the books.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, whose book you want?

**Interviewer (2):**
Some specific [Hindi]. If you give me some publications.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhāgavatam.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Maybe one copy of //Bhāgavatam,// one copy of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We have got so many. You can give one of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One set of //Bhāgavatam...//

**Prabhupāda:**
First part.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[indistinct]

**Devotee:**
Then you can...

**Prabhupāda:**
You can take that copy, that //Bhāgavatam// there. That //Bhāgavatam?// Yes?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That one?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Interviewer:**
[indistinct] completed [indistinct]

**Brahmānanda:**
This is a special edition which they printed for you, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] same thing.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
It’s the gold copy, special gold copy for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Give him gold. [others laugh] If you want to give, give gold. So you can take it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[indistinct]

**Interviewer:**
[indistinct]

[indistinct background comments as they find //Caitanya-caritāmṛta//]

**Interviewer:**
Complete in seventeen volumes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. You can see.

**Interviewer:**
So we need the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// volumes, complete translation.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Interviewer:**
[Hindi]

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// will be completed in sixty. Sixty.

[indistinct background comments]

**Brahmānanda:**
Prabhupāda begins writing between one and two o'clock in the morning. He rises at one o'clock in the morning and begins his writing in the early morning hours.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
He has to fit this in, while managing an international Society.

**Brahmānanda:**
He dictates tape on this Dictaphone here. He dictates tapes. Then these tapes are sent to America.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
And it shows where it is...

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the date?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Today's the twenty-sixth; 26/2/77.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Interviewer:**
[indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think that you'll also be able to keep one of these copies, because this will give you a lot of detailed information.

[indistinct background comments; Indians exchange briefly in Hindi]

**Interviewer:**
Indian sculptural beauty, in Berkeley and other places. Typical Indian.

**Brahmānanda:**

**Prabhupāda:**
There is similar temple in Australia? Melbourne?

**Interviewer:**
Yeah.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**

**Rādhā-vallabha:**

**Interviewer (2):**

**Rādhā-vallabha:**

**Interviewer:**
But who has done all these Deities?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**

**Interviewer:**
These photographs?

**Brahmānanda:**
The photographs are taken by our own men.

**Interviewer:**
Ah. From..., from Indian temples?

Everything's made in America.

**Brahmānanda:**
Many //gurus// and //svāmīs// have come to the West, but they have not established not one temple. And Prabhupāda has established one hundred.

**Prabhupāda:**
Neither so many devotees.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The daily..., the monthly expenditure in our New York temple is six //lakhs// rupees, every month...

**Interviewer:**
This is really an adventure, just think of, that a man, at the age of seventy, with such difficulty.

Hmm. Most daring.

Most daring.

**Prabhupāda:**
Many friends doubted, that "This man is going to die."

Going to die.

**Brahmānanda:**
Before Prabhupāda left...

**Interviewer:**
Ah.

**Brahmānanda:**
...and people were saying that "You will go there, you will die."

Ah.

**Brahmānanda:**
...but they decided to make it "Bhaktivedanta Swami Road."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The things they questioned, "Who has done the most to spread the fame of Vṛndāvana worldwide?" And they had to certainly agree that Śrīla Prabhupāda had done it.

**Interviewer:**
I think that is only [indistinct]. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I don't mind that, [indistinct]. Only that I did not say that they do not allow these boys to stay...

**Prabhupāda:**
No...

**Prabhupāda & Brahmānanda:**
...in India.

**Prabhupāda:**
The Immigration Department....

**Interviewer:**
Why? What is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is their policy; special program is there. And the result is that I have to send back, and again they come back, at ten thousand rupees. Such fifty cases, at least, happening every year. So just imagine, at least fifty cases, ten thousand [indistinct]---head---what is the loss.
