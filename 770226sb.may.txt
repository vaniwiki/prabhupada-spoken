**Devotee:**
//...sa tat-kara-sparśa-dhutākhilāśubhaḥ// [break] [continues leading chanting of verse, but he and devotees stumble over pronunciation]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tat-kara-sparśa-dhuta-akhila-aśubhaḥ.//

**Devotee:**
[chants, but devotees still having problems with pronunciation]

**Prabhupāda:**
You can divide the syllables: //sa tat-kara-sparśa-dhuta-akhila-aśubhaḥ.// You cannot pronounce combinedly, just divide. //Sa tat-kara-sparśa-dhuta-akhila-aśubhaḥ,// like that. Anyway, chant. [Pradyumna continues chanting again, devotees chant slowly] There is no board writing. Why? So many men, could not write the board? They cannot see. Go on. [devotees attempt to chant verse] Hmm. That's all right. Difficult.

**Pradyumna:**
//saḥ//---he [Prahlāda Mahārāja]; //tat-kara-sparśa//---because of being touched on the head by the lotus hand of Nṛsiṁha-deva; //dhuta//---being cleansed; //akhila//---all; //aśubhaḥ//---inauspiciousness or material desires; //sapadi//---immediately; //abhivyakta//---manifested; //para-ātma-darśanaḥ//---realization of the Supreme Soul [spiritual knowledge]; //tat-pāda-padmam//---Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva's lotus feet; //hṛdi//---within the core of the heart; //nirvṛtaḥ//---full of transcendental bliss; //dadhau//---captured; //hṛṣyat-tanuḥ//---having transcendental ecstatic bliss manifested in the body; //klinna-hṛt//---whose heart was softened due to transcendental ecstasy; //aśru-locanaḥ//---with tears in his eyes.

Translation: "By the touch of Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva's hand on Prahlāda Mahārāja's head, Prahlāda was completely freed of all material contaminations and desires, as if he had been thoroughly cleansed. Therefore he at once became transcendentally situated, and all the symptoms of ecstasy became manifest in his body. His heart filled with love, and his eyes with tears, and thus he was able to completely capture the lotus feet of the Lord within the core of his heart."

**Prabhupāda:**

> sa tat-kara-sparśa-dhutākhilāśubhaḥ
> sapady abhivyakta-parātma-darśanaḥ
> tat-pāda-padmaṁ hṛdi nivṛto dadhau
> hṛṣyat-tanuḥ klinna-hṛd-aśru-locanaḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:6|[SB 7.9.6]]]

So Prahlāda Mahārāja, //tat-kara-sparśa,// "touch of the lotus palm of Nṛsiṁha-deva," the same palm where there is nail. //Tava kara kamala-vare nakham adbhuta-sṛṅgam.// The same palm with //nakha adbhuta... Dalita-hiraṇyakaśipu-tanu-bhṛṅgam.// Immediately, with the nails only... The Lord did not require any weapon to kill this gigantic demon, simply nails. //Tava kara-kamala.// The example is very nice: //kamala. Kamala// means lotus flower. The Lord's palm is just like lotus flower. Therefore in the lotus flower it is very soft, very pleasing, and how the nails came? Therefore //adbhuta. Tava kara-kamala, adbhuta. Nakham adbhuta-sṛṅgam.// It is not possible to grow some ferocious nails, piercing nails, in the lotus flower. This is contradictory. Therefore Jayadeva says //adbhuta:// "It is wonderful. It is astonishing." This... Therefore Lord's power, exhibition of power and sharp nails, they're all inconceivable. Śrīla Jīva Goswami has explained, "Unless you accept inconceivable power of the Supreme Lord, there is no understanding." //Acintya. Acintya-śakti. Acintya// means "inconceivable." You cannot speculate how it is happening, how in the lotus flower there is so hard nail that immediately, within a second, it could kill a great demon like Hiranyakasipu. Therefore it is //acintya.// We cannot conceive. //Acintya.// And therefore Vedic instruction is //acintyā khalu ye bhāvā na taṁś tarkeṇa yo jayet:// "Do not apply your poor logic in the matters which is inconceivable by you." There is no logic that how lotus flower can grow nails. They say "mythology." Because they cannot conceive within their poor brain, they cannot accommodate how things happen like that, they say "mythology." Not mythology. It is fact. But it is inconceivable by you or us. It is not possible.

So that, the same //kara kamala,// was put on the head of Prahlāda Mahārāja. //Prahlādāhlāda-dāyine.// Prahlāda Mahārāja was feeling, "Oh, how blissful this hand." Not only feeling, but immediately all his material unhappiness, pangs, disappeared. This is the process of transcendental touch. We can have the same facility in this age. It is not that Prahlāda Mahārāja became immediately jubilant by the touch of the lotus palm of the Lord. You can have the same benefit immediately if we become like Prahlāda Mahārāja. Then it is possible. Kṛṣṇa is //advaya-jñāna,// so in this age Kṛṣṇa has descended in His sound vibration form: //kali yuga nama rūpe kṛṣṇāvatāra// [Cc. Adi-lila 17.22]. This age... Because these fallen men in this age, they are... They have no qualification. //Mandāḥ.// Everyone is bad. Nobody is qualified. They have no spiritual knowledge. Don't mind. In your Western country they are very much puffed up with material knowledge, but they have no spiritual knowledge. Perhaps in the history, for the first time in the history, they're getting some information of spiritual knowledge.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise there was no spiritual knowledge. They do not know. That's a fact.

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said,

> bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ
> khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca
> bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā
> [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]

These materialistic persons---scientists, physists and other speculators---they're dealing with these elements, material---earth, water, fire, air, ether, up to mind, psychology, or, little advanced, intelligence, but no more. They are dealing in their university, colleges, educational institution. They are concerned with these elements, material. They have no spiritual knowledge. Kṛṣṇa said... We get information from the //Bhagavad-gītā, apareyam:// "These eight elements, they are inferior." Therefore, because they are dealing with this inferior nature only, their knowledge is inferior. This is a fact. It is not that I am accusing. No. This is the... They have no information. Big, big professor, they say that this body finished... "Body finished" means //pañcatva-prāpta.// They do not know that there is another body, subtle body---mind, intelligence, ego. They do not know. They are thinking this earth, water, air, fire, ether, that much..., "This is finished. I see, either you burn the body or bury the body, finished, everything finished. And where is other thing?" So they have no knowledge. So they have no knowledge even of the subtle body, earth, water, which carries the soul, and what they'll know about the soul?

So Kṛṣṇa gives information in the //Bhagavad-gītā, apareyam:// "These elements, even up to mind, intelligence, ego," //bhinnā,// "they are My separated energy, separated energy. And," //apareyam,// "this is inferior. And there is another, superior nature." //Apareyam itas tv viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā. Parā// means "superior." Now, they may be asking, "What is that? We know these elements only. What is that another, superior energy?" //Jīva bhūtaḥ mahā-bāho,// clearly said: "That is living..." And they are thinking that there is no other superior energy except these eight material elements or five elements. Therefore they are in ignorance. It is for the first time they are getting some knowledge, //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,// and from that they can know that there is another, superior energy, who is //jīva-bhūtaḥ.// The living entity which is moving the body, that is superior energy. So they have no information, neither there is an attempt to understand that superior energy in their universities or institution. Therefore they are //mūḍha, mūḍhas.// They may be very much puffed up of their so-called knowledge, but according to Vedic knowledge they are //mūḍhas.// And if one cannot understand the superior energy, //prakṛti,// nature, then how one can understand God? That is not possible. Then again, dealings between God and the superior energy, that is //bhakti.// It is very difficult. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. That //siddhaye// means to understand that superior energy. That is //siddhi.// And after that, one can understand Kṛṣṇa.

So it is very difficult, especially in this age. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. They are... //Mandāḥ// means they are not interested, or even they are little interested, they are very slow. They do not understand this is the prime knowledge. And first of all you must know it, //athāto brahma jijñāsā,// that superior knowledge. That is required. But everyone is neglecting. There is no inquisitiveness even what is that thing which is moving this body. There is no inquiry. They think automatically, by combination of this matter... They are still persisting on this point, and when you challenge, "You take this chemical and prepare the living force," they'll say, "That I cannot do." And what is this? If you cannot do, then why you are speaking like nonsense, that "The combination of matter or chemicals gives the life"? You take the chemicals. Our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara in the California University... One big professor came to lecture on chemical evolution, and he challenged immediately, that "If I give you the chemicals, can you produce life?" He said, "That I cannot say." [chuckles] So this is their position. They cannot prove it. They cannot do it. Science means not only observation but experiment also. That is complete. Otherwise theory. It is not science. So they have got different theories. That anyone can put forward. That is not... But real fact is that Kṛṣṇa is spiritual and He's the Supreme. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. This is the Vedic injunction. God is the supreme //nitya,// eternal, and the supreme living being. In the dictionary also it is said, "God means the supreme being." They could not understand "supreme //living// being." But in the //Vedas// it is said not only supreme being, but supreme living being. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetānām eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. That is the description of God. So it is very difficult to understand even the spiritual substance, and what to speak of God. The beginning of spiritual knowledge is to understand first of all what is spirit. And they are taking the intelligence or mind as spirit. But that is not spirit. Beyond that. //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtim parā// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]].

So this perfection, as Prahlāda Mahārāja had immediately by touching the Supreme Personality of..., we can also have. There is possibility, and very easily, because we are fallen, //mandāḥ//---very slow, very bad. //Mandāḥ// and //sumanda-matayo.// And because we are bad, everyone has manufactured a theory. //Sumanda. Mata. Mata// means "opinion." And what is that opinion? Not only //mandā// but //sumanda,// very, very bad. //Sumanda-matayo. Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]], and all unfortunate, or misfortunate. Why? When there is knowledge, they'll not take. They will theorize. They're unfortunate. Ready knowledge, but they will theorize, "It is like this. It is like that. It is like that. Perhaps... Maybe..." This is going on. Therefore //manda-bhāgyāh.// Just like here is money. One will not take that money. He'll work hard like hogs and dog to earn money. So that means unfortunate. So //mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyāḥ.// And because //manda-bhāgyāḥ,// there is //upadrutaḥ,// always disturbance---this war, that war, that war. Beginning, whole history, simply war. Why war? Why there is fight? There should not be any fight, because everything is complete, //pūrṇam idam// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśopaniṣad, Invocation]]]. The world is full by the mercy of the Supreme Lord, because it is the kingdom... This is also kingdom of God. But we have made it hell by unnecessarily fighting. That's all. Otherwise it is... For a devotee---//pūrṇam. Viśvaṁ pūrṇaṁ sukhāyate.// Why there should be fight? God has supplied everything. You want water? Three-fourths of the earth is full of water. But that water is salt. God has process how to make it sweet. You cannot do this. Water you want. There is sufficient water. Why there should be scarcity? Now we heard in Europe they were contemplating importing water. [laughter] Was not that? Yes. In England they were thinking of importing. Is that possible? [laughter] But these rascal scientists think like that. They'll import. Why not? The England is surrounded by water. Why don't you take water? No. //Nire kari bas na me tilo piyas.// "I'm living in water, but I'm dying of thirst." [laughter] These rascals' philosophy... Or in... I think in our childhood we read one book, a Moral Class book, said there was a story that shipwrecked, and they took the shelter of one boat, but some of them died of thirst because they could not drink water. So in this water they were living, but they died of thirst.

So our position is like that. Everything is full. Still, we are dying and fighting. What is the reason? The reason is that we do not follow Kṛṣṇa. This is the reason: absence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that the whole world is full of everything. Only scarcity is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Only scarcity. Otherwise there is no scarcity. Everything is full. And if you take the instruction of Kṛṣṇa you will be happy immediately. You can make the whole world happy. This instruction of Kṛṣṇa in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// so perfect. It must be perfect, because it is coming from Kṛṣṇa. It is not the so-called scientist theory. No. Perfect instruction. And if we follow the instruction, if we practically utilize, then whole world, //viśvaṁ pūrṇaṁ sukhāyate.//

So as Nṛsiṁha-deva touched the head of Prahlāda Mahārāja, immediately you can have that same facility. "What is that facility? How? Nṛsiṁha-deva is not here. Kṛṣṇa is not here." No. He is here. "What is that?" //Nama rūpe kali kale kṛṣṇa avatāra// [[books:cc:adi:17:22|[Cc. Ādi 17.22]]]. Kṛṣṇa is present by His name, Kṛṣṇa. Don't think this Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, this name, is different from Kṛṣṇa. Absolute. Kṛṣṇa, the Deity Kṛṣṇa, the name Kṛṣṇa, the person Kṛṣṇa---everything, the same Absolute Truth. There is no differentiation. So in this age simply by chanting: //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet// [SB 12.3.51]. Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa... //Nama-cintāmaṇi kṛṣṇaḥ caitanya-rasa-vigrahaḥ, pūrṇaḥ śuddho nitya-muktaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:133|[Cc. Madhya 17.133]]]. Don't think the holy name of Kṛṣṇa is different from Kṛṣṇa. It is //pūrṇam. Pūrṇaḥ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idam// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśopaniṣad, Invocation]]]. Everything //pūrṇa. Pūrṇa// means "complete." We have tried to explain this completeness in our //Īśopaniṣad.// You have read. So stick to the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. You'll get the same benefit as Prahlāda Mahārāja got by direct touch of the lotus palm of Nṛsiṁha-deva. There is no difference. Always think like that, that as soon as you are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, you must know that you are touching Kṛṣṇa with your tongue. Then you get the same benefit as Prahlāda Mahārāja.

Thank you very much.
