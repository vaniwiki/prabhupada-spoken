**Prabhupāda:**
...their intelligence. [break] Utilize it very nicely. Kṛṣṇa will be very, very pleased. This is our real business. Every..., every work is nice. Still, one should work... That is to be designated by the spiritual... "This man..." Knows how to engage this man.

**Harikeśa:**
I was going to bring with me the new Hungarian book, but the person who was bringing it from the printer, the car broke down before the airplane could... The car broke down. It was printed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Could not reach.

**Harikeśa:**
It could not reach me at the airplane. So, I think, when Bhagavān comes he will bring the book.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have advised.

**Harikeśa:**
I tried. I tried. I don't know. Otherwise it will come by mail. We printed ten thousand Hungarian books.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that book?

**Harikeśa:**
It's //Perfection of Yoga// and //Beyond Birth and Death// in the same cover, because...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Like the German edition.

**Harikeśa:**
Hungarian.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Germany, they have put three books in a packet. Like that?

**Harikeśa:**
Oh, that. No, no. It's in one little book.

**Hari-śauri:**
It's one book, but it has both books together.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, I see. That's nice.

**Harikeśa:**
Because I thought this //Easy Journey// was a little hard for Hungarians. They're not so intelligent like. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
What about that Russian?

**Harikeśa:**
Ah. The Russian book was //Easy Journey// and the talk with Professor Kotovsky. And the //Īśopaniṣad// is now being translated.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Russian?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes. Dvārakeśa, he's now a Swedish citizen. Dvārakeśa. I sent him to Poland. You know Dvārakeśa? He was that boy who was going to go to Hungary? He's a Hungarian. He was going to go back to Hungary and become a Hungarian.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Harikeśa:**
So he's become a Swedish citizen. Now he can come and go as he likes everywhere. So now he's in Poland, and in Poland there are many Russians, and it is very easy to get a book translated by them. Otherwise, with Dvārakeśa it takes so long.

**Hari-śauri:**
There's a man in New Vrindavan who speaks fluent Russian. He graduated in Russian.

**Harikeśa:**
Really?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. [indistinct]

**Harikeśa:**
I did not know this.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is his name? He is initiated?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. He's initiated devotee. He's been around for a few years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, he should be... Ask him to come then.

**Harikeśa:**
To come to?

**Prabhupāda:**
Here, to talk with you. Yes. Send him a telegram.

**Harikeśa:**
Ah. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They'll meet and they'll talk.

**Harikeśa:**
And the Polish book, we were working like crazy but couldn't finish it in time.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, should not be done... Slow...

**Harikeśa:**
So it will be ready in one week. That one is //Easy Journey.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Slowly but surely. And the small book, first of all print.

**Harikeśa:**
And Yugoslavian //Īśopaniṣad,// that will be ready within, I think, one month, one and a half months.

**Prabhupāda:**
If there is scarcity of money, you ask me. I shall pay you. You can pay me later.

**Harikeśa:**
Actually there's no scarcity.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Harikeśa:**
German BBT, I think, is...

**Prabhupāda:**
For printing there should not be any delay for money. Whatever money you require, I shall arrange.

**Harikeśa:**
I'm trying to follow your principle of not keeping a bank account by just always printing more books.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes, yes. It is very nice. I simply asking them that "Print books. Whatever money I have got in bank, let me spend." I am asking always. Always. So anyway, money is... Bhagavān is giving. Now I have asked them to invest at least five //lakhs// of rupees for printing these Hindi and Bengali books.

**Harikeśa:**
I just suggested also that Gopāla Kṛṣṇa could...

**Prabhupāda:**
Instead of keeping in the bank, keep books stock. It will save. That principles let us follow. Simply keep the book that it may not be spoiled, it may not be stolen. Otherwise it is our..., as good as government currency notes. Take that. As soon as there is money, convert it into books.

**Harikeśa:**
I was thinking also that Gopāla Kṛṣṇa could buy the milk powder from Bali-mardana by printing books for him. He could print the books in India for Australia...

**Prabhupāda:**
I have suggested already, already suggested that "Take milk powder and //ghee// from Australia, and every center distribute //prasādam// like anything." And in India at least, if you give them nice //purī// and //chānā// preparation and sweet preparation from milk, oh, they'll be so glad, both poor man and rich man. Yesterday I was eating //kacaurīs.// What is this //kacaurī?// Made of //ghee. Samosā,// made of //ghee; rasagullā,// made of... Cow is so important. She can deliver so many nice preparations, sweet and salty. The whole world does not know how to eat. Like //rākṣasas// they are killing the poor animals. So we have to teach. This is an introduction of new type of civilization for making life successful.

**Harikeśa:**
This news in India that they are outlawing cow-killing---some news has been coming that they're outlawing cow-killing in India---is very encouraging to all the devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They are doing it on account of this movement. Government has appreciation our movement, from private sources. Now this, our American, what is called? Opposing.

**Hari-śauri:**
Deprogrammers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Deprogramming. The Indian government are taking seriously, yes. That is private arrangement, that "Why they are opposing this movement? We allow Christian to come here. Why not Kṛṣṇa?" The Consulate General, Ambassador, has taken.

**Harikeśa:**
It is very important.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are taking it from national point of view. That is... Anyway, there is some defense from government side, their representative attending every court case. Yes?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. Every hearing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ādi-keśava told me.

**Harikeśa:**
In Germany the court case is fixed in November now. They have made a date.

**Prabhupāda:**
In the meantime you overflood with books.

**Harikeśa:**
[laughs] Yes. An amazing thing is happening now. Used to be...

**Prabhupāda:**
They are delaying.

**Harikeśa:**
No. I mean when we distribute books, it used to be that people would say, "Oh, this is Hare Kṛṣṇa. I want nothing to do with it." Now they say, "Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hmm. Let me see what is in this book."

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Now they are... They'll, "Hmm." That's all right. [laughter] No, if there is substance they will take it. They're intelligent persons. Yes. Simply by propaganda you cannot make them fool. I know German nation. They're intelligent.

**Harikeśa:**
And in Austria the amazing thing is...

**Prabhupāda:**
And by propaganda you can make anyone fool. //Dāsa cakre bhagavān bhūta.//[?] You know this story?

**Harikeśa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
One man, so he had many friends. So they made a plea that we shall...

**Harikeśa:**
Oh, say he's a ghost.

**Prabhupāda:**
"Here is a ghost" [laughter] So he began to think, "Maybe I have become ghost. Everyone said that I am ghost, I am ghost." So //dāsa cakre bhagavān.// He not ghost, but by the propaganda, he began to think, "Maybe I have become ghost."

**Harikeśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So by propaganda, it is happened. Although he is not ghost, he began to think that "Maybe I have become ghost."

**Harikeśa:**
In Austria something very, very nice has happened. We were never able before to sell books, because whenever Germans went there the Austrian government caught them and charged us thousands of dollars' fine and threw us out of the country. But now I've sent one devotee who was blooped for one year. His name is Cakravartī. He used to be the most important person in Germany.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
And so by your mercy I managed to drag him back by his hair one day, and I sent him and his wife to Austria, and now they are doing something amazing. They never spend even one penny. Everywhere they go, they beg as monks that someone should please give them a place to stay and something to eat, and they're begging gasoline and they're selling so many books, it's inconceivable. The bookstores...

**Prabhupāda:**
German language. German language.

**Harikeśa:**
In German language, yes. To bookstores. Bookstores are buying like anything, and people are buying the books on the bookstores. Because we can't sell in the streets, so they're buying in the bookstores. And he's also training up Austrians to sell books, and gradually it's expanding. One day last week---he called me just before I left---he sold 1,200 marks' worth of books in six hours. It's simply fantastic.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is all Kṛṣṇa's grace. Let us try our best sincerely, and Kṛṣṇa will give us. //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. Otherwise how it is happening? In foreign countries, a system of philosophy which is foreign to them, how they are purchasing? In India, if they purchase one //Bhāgavatam,// it has got meaning. But in Germany, purchasing //Bhāgavatam,// it is only Kṛṣṇa's grace. How it is possible? And India, nobody is interested to purchase Bible. So if they purchase //Bhāgavatam,// that is not surprising. But in Europe and America in Christian..., er, Christmas festivities they are purchasing. So it is all Kṛṣṇa's arrangement. We sold more books in Christmas festivals.

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh, yes. Christmas is always big.

**Prabhupāda:**
What business they have got---Christmas festival and purchasing //Bhāgavata?// What is that?

**Brahmānanda:**
This is wording for the Certificate of Awards. The Certificate of Awards.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha ha. Ha ha.

**Brahmānanda:**
So it would be printed as following: "International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. Founder-//ācārya// His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. To certify that ... has attained the highest outstanding excellence in executing devotional service in the field of ... during the year 491 Caitanya Era [1976–77], this Certificate is hereby personally awarded from the hand of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, founder-//ācārya// of the Society, and in witness thereof, the founder-//ācārya// gives his seal and signature at Śrī Māyāpur Candrodaya Mandir, West Bengal, India, on this auspicious 491st birthday anniversary of the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, March 5th, 1977. Signed A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami, GBC and Temple President."

**Prabhupāda:**
So I think the wording is little more. It can be reduced.

**Brahmānanda:**
Reduced.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. That you can... Otherwise it is all right. Try to reduce the wording little more. Then it will be all right.

**Harikeśa:**
Rohiṇī-suta Prabhu, who's probably going to win this, he never wants to come to this festival because he never wants to stop distributing your books, not for one day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Then his certificate should be sent at least.

**Brahmānanda:**
You said you wanted to give certain titles for different categories? So should we give you a list of...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you keep this place. We shall write in hand.

**Hari-śauri:**
No title. Just the certificate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Better you can print in script.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. We have... Muralīdhara is here.

**Prabhupāda:**
And good, good paper. Then in script we shall write the title.

**Brahmānanda:**
So "This is to..." The title will be... He has here, "devotional service in the field of..." Let's say the field is //pūjārī// worship.

**Prabhupāda:**
So keep that blank.

**Brahmānanda:**
So that would be the title, Pūjārī Worship?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, title...

**Brahmānanda:**
That would be something else.

**Prabhupāda:**
Something else.

**Brahmānanda:**
So the title could maybe come on the top, like...

**Prabhupāda:**
You can... Where is our //paṇḍita?// Call him. [chuckling] What is the meaning of //kovida?//

**Pradyumna:**
"Very expert." //Sevā-kovida// or... Expert.

**Prabhupāda:**
That "//kovida//" we shall give. "//Pūjā-kovida,//" "//Pracāra-kovida,//" like that.

**Brahmānanda:**
K-a-u?

**Pradyumna:**
K-o-v-i-d-a. //Kovida.//

**Prabhupāda:**
"//Pūjā-kovida,//" "//Pracāra-kovida,//" like that. We shall... "//Kovida//" word.

**Hari-śauri:**
What heading does book distribution come under?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is //pracāraka.// Book distributor---//pracāraka,// preacher.

**Brahmānanda:**
Temple management?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is //śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-man... "Mandira-mārjana-kovida.//" That is recommended. //Śrī-vigrahārā... Pūjā. Ārādhana-kovida,// this title. "//Ārādhana-kovida,//" "//mārjana-kovida,//" "//pracāraka...,//" "//pracāra-kovida,//" like that---three, four. Not many.

**Brahmānanda:**
So that can go on the top of the certificate?

**Prabhupāda:**
And one who is learned scholar, then "//śāstrī,//" "//bhakti-śāstrī.//"

**Harikeśa:**
In other words, you want "//ārādhan-kovida//" instead of "//pūjā-kovida.//"

**Pradyumna:**
//Ārādhana. A-r-a-d-h-a-n-a.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. This is like Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, like that. //Ārādhana-kovida.// A.K. [laughter] Instead of B.A., A.K. Make nice paper, nice script, and the titles should be written in handwriting so that he can frame it and keep it.

**Hari-śauri:**
Should there be some kind of a seal?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
We have an ISKCON seal.

**Prabhupāda:**
ISKCON seal, or seal like that.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah, that's what I meant, like...

**Brahmānanda:**
You get these foil...

**Prabhupāda:**
Gradually we shall increase so that... It should be attractive. He'll like to keep it. People should be encouraged. //Utsāha. Utsāha. Utsāha// is an item in //bhakti,// first the //utsāha.// Just like this boy. He did not come here, so he's so //utsāha,// enthusiasm. So he should be encouraged. And the whole basis of the devotional service is //utsāha.// Just like unless there was //utsāha,// how a man of seventy years old, without any hope, could go to such distant place from Vṛndāvana to New York? The only platform was //utsāha.// So //utsāha// is so important thing. Means they should be encouraged, spiritual life. //Utsāhān niścayād dhairyāt tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt// [//Upadeśāmṛta// 3]. All right. Thank you.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [offer obeisances] Thank you. [break]

**Harikeśa:**
...million copies in print.

**Prabhupāda:**
Looks little thicker than the other.

**Harikeśa:**
Yes, it's two books in one.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Any letter?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes. This is from Dvārakeśa, the boy who does this work.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Āsuna. Bosen.// Hungarian language [Bengali]... [end]
