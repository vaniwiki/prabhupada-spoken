**Prabhupāda:**
[leads Jaya Radha Madhava] [break]

**Pradyumna: **[leads chanting, etc.] Translation: "Prahlāda Mahārāja fixed his mind and sight upon Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva with full attention in complete trance. With a fixed mind, he began to offer prayers in love with a faltering voice."

**Prabhupāda:**

> astauṣīd dharim ekāgra-
> manasā susamāhitaḥ
> prema-gadgadayā vācā
> tan-nyasta-hṛdayekṣanaḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:7|[SB 7.9.7]]]

So this is the process. This process you cannot expect immediately, but if you practice general process, very easily done, as it is recommended in the //Bhagavad-gītā, man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. You cannot get the position of Prahlāda Mahārāja immediately. That is not possible. The process is, first of all, //sādhana-bhakti.// This Prahlāda Mahārāja's position is different. He is //mahā-bhāgavata.// In many places we have seen already, he is //nitya-siddha.// There are two kinds of devotees..., three: //nitya-siddha, sādhana-siddha, kṛpa-siddha.// These things are described in //The Nectar of Devotion. Nitya-siddha// means they are eternally associate of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. They are called //nitya-siddha.// And //sādhana-siddha// means one is fallen in this material world, but by practice of devotional service according to the rules and regulation, injunction of the //śāstra,// direction of //guru,// in this way, one can reach also the same position as the //nitya-siddha.// This is //sādhana-siddha.// And there is another. That is //kṛpa-siddha. Kṛpa-siddha// means... Just like Nityānanda Prabhu, He wanted that these Jagāi-Mādhāi must be delivered. There was no //sādhana.// They never followed any rules and regulation. They were thieves and rogues, very fallen condition. But Nityānanda Prabhu wanted to show an example that "I shall deliver these two brothers. Never mind they are so fallen." That is called //kṛpa-siddha.// So we should always remember there are three categories: //nitya-siddha, sādhana-siddha// and //kṛpa-siddha.// But when they become //siddha,// perfect, by any process, they are on the same level. There is no distinction.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja's position is //nitya-siddha. Gaurāṅgera saṅgi gane nitya-siddha boli māne.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He came... Not only He, but others also. Just like with Kṛṣṇa so many devotees, they descended, just like Arjuna. Arjuna is //nitya-siddha, nitya-siddha// friend. When Kṛṣṇa said that "I spoke this philosophy of //Bhagavad-gītā// to the sun-god," //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]], that is so many millions of years ago. To clear the matter, Arjuna inquired that "Kṛṣṇa, You are of my age. How I can believe that You spoke this philosophy so many millions of years ago?" So what Kṛṣṇa replied, you know, that "My dear Arjuna, both you and Me, we appeared many, many times. The difference is that you have forgotten. That means you were also present at that time, because you are My //nitya-siddha// friend. Whenever I appear, you also appear. But you have forgotten; I have not forgotten." That is the difference between //jīva// and //śiva//[?], or Lord, that we are minute part and particle of the Supreme; therefore we may forget. But Kṛṣṇa does not forget. That is the difference. So //nitya-siddha.// Prahlāda Mahārāja is to be understood as //nitya, mahā-bhāgavata, nitya-siddha.// They appear to complete the //līlā// of Kṛṣṇa.

So we should not try to imitate Prahlāda Mahārāja. That is not good. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ,// I have already explained yesterday. Prahlāda Mahārāja is one of the //mahājanas,// authorized persons, authorized devotee. We should try to follow him. //Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ.// So //śrutayo vibhinnāḥ.//

> tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā
> nāsau munir yasya matam na bhinnam
> dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyāṁ
> mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]

You cannot understand God by logic and arguments. It will never settle up. There are so many Māyāvādīs, they are going on perpetually: "What is God?" //Neti neti:// "This is not, this is not, this is not. What is Brahman?" So by that process you'll never be able to understand what is God. //Jñāne prayāse udapāsya namanta eva.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu has accepted this formula. By knowledge, by your erudite scholarship, if you want to understand---you may be very high-standard scholar---but that is not your qualification to understand God. That is not qualification. You have to give up your vanity that "I am rich," "I am very learned," "I am very beautiful," "I am very...," so on, so on. They are //janmaiśvarya śruta śrī// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]]. These are not qualification. Kuntīdevī has said, //akincana gocaraḥ:// "Kṛṣṇa, You are //akiñcana gocara.//" //Akiñcana. Kiñcana// means if somebody thinks that "I possess this; therefore I can purchase Kṛṣṇa," oh, no, that is not. That is not possible. You have to become blank, //akiñcana-gocaraḥ.//

So Prahlāda Mahārāja... There was some disagreement with the father, but he was not ordinary person. His father might... He's a very, very big man, you see. He conquered the whole universe. So he was not a poor man's son. He was very rich man's son, Prahlāda Mahārāja. And he was educated by his father sufficiently. Of course, within five years... So //janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī.// Everything was there, but Prahlāda Mahārāja was not depending on his material circumstances; he was depending on his profound, ecstatic transcendental bliss of devotional service. That is wanted. So that stage immediately we cannot reach. He is //nitya-siddha.// As I was going to explain, that whenever Kṛṣṇa descends, His //nitya-siddha// devotees, associates, they also come. So //gaurāṅgera saṅgi-gaṇe, nitya-siddha boli māne, tara haya vrajabhūmi vāsa,// like that, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura... Just like //śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī advaita gadādhara śrīvasadi gaura bhakta vṛnda.// So these associates of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they are //nitya-siddha.// You cannot avoid any one of them and make your imagination, that "I shall simply worship..." [break]

Kṛṣṇa has appeared---Panca-tattva. Kṛṣṇa is //īśa,// and Nityānanda Prabhu, He is //prakāśa,// the first expansion of God. God has many expansion. //Advaita acyuta anādi ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam// [Bs. 5.33]. He has got thousands and thousands exp... So first expansion is Baladeva-tattva, Nityānanda; and His incarnation, Advaita; and His spiritual potency, Gadādhara; and His marginal potency, Śrīvāsa. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu has appeared with //pañca..., pañca-tattvātmakam.// You cannot neglect anything. If you think that "I shall simply worship...," oh, that is a great offense, "...Caitanya Mahāprabhu or only Caitanya-Nityānanda" No. You must worship Pañca-tattva, //pañca-tattvātmakaṁ kṛṣṇam,// in full. Similarly, the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// sixteen names, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ [devotees chant] Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. So you cannot mix up. You must do according to //śāstra. Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. If you deviate from the //śāstra,// then you will never be successful.

> yaḥ śāstra vidhim utsṛjya
> vartate kāma-kārataḥ
> na siddhim avāpnoti
> na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:16:23|[Bg. 16.23]]]

So if you want to approach the same level like Prahlāda Mahārāja, we should not immediately imitate him. We must follow the //sādhana-bhakti, sādhana-bhakti,// for general; and //kṛpa-siddha,// that is special. That is incalculable. If Kṛṣṇa wants, He can make immediately somebody very important. That is //kṛpa-siddha.// So there are three classes of devotees: //nitya-siddha// and //sādhana-siddha// and //kṛpa-siddha.// Prahlāda Mahārāja is //nitya-siddha.// He is not ordinary //sādhana-siddha// or... Of course, ultimately there is no difference, either //sādhana-siddha// or //kṛpa-siddha// or //nitya-siddha,// but we should always remember that Prahlāda Mahārāja is not ordinary devotee; he is //nitya-siddha.// Therefore immediately he developed the transcendental symptoms, //aṣṭa-siddhi. Aṣṭa-siddhi,// you have read in //The Nectar of Devotion.// So the ecstasies, //ekāgra-manasā. Ekāgra-manasā,// "with full attention." For us to bring that full attention may take hundreds and thousands of years, full attention. But Prahlāda Mahārāja---immediately. Immediately, five-years-old boy---because he is //nitya-siddha.// Always we should remember that we cannot imitate. "Now, Prahlāda Mahārāja has immediately //ekāgra-manasā,// and I shall become also." No. That is not possible. //May// be possible, but that is not the way.

Just like in our country, perhaps you know, there was a poet, Rabindranath Tagore. He got many distinction from the Oxford University. He got... He never went to a school, but he got the title "doctor," "Dr. Rabindranath Tagore." And if you think that "I shall also get doctorate without going to a school," that is foolishness. That is special. Similarly, don't try to imitate. Follow the general course, //sādhana-siddhi.// The regulative principles you must follow as instructed in the //śāstra.// Therefore there are so many //śāstras.// And //guru// is guide. We must always... Even if you are //nitya-siddha// or //kṛpa-siddha,// you should not neglect the general regulative principle. That is very dangerous. Don't try to do that. We must follow. //Nitya...// Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Kṛṣṇa Himself, God, but He is accepting //guru.// Who is His //guru?// He is //guru// of everyone, but He has also accepted Īśvara Purī as His //guru.// Kṛṣṇa Himself, He accepted His //guru,// Sāndīpani Muni, teaching us that without //guru// you cannot make any advance. //Ādau gurvāśrayam.// The first business is to accept //guru. Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. Don't think that "I am so advanced. I may not require any //guru.// I can do without //guru.//" That is nonsense. That, not possible. "Must." //Tad vijñānārtham. Tad-vijñānārtham// is spiritual science. "Must approach." //Gurum evābhigacchet samit-paniḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham. Tasmād-guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. If you are actually serious to understand the transcendental science, spiritual knowledge, oh, you must have //guru. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam.// And just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. //Guru// cannot be self-made. No. There is no such single instance throughout the whole Vedic literature. And nowadays, so many rascals, they are becoming //guru// without any authority. That is not //guru.// You must be authorized. //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rā...// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. As soon as the //paramparā// is lost, //sa kālena yoga naṣṭo parantapa,// immediately finished. The spiritual potency finished. You can dress like a //guru,// you can talk big, big words, but it will never be effective.

So these are the science. So Prahlāda Mahārāja is our //guru.// He's not ordinary. Don't think that "He's a five-years-old boy; he has no knowledge." No. He is perfect //nitya-siddha guru,// and we should always pray for his mercy. And that is Vaiṣṇava //ṭhākura. Vaiṣṇava ṭhākur tomāra kukkura boliyā jānaha more.// This is a humble way. "O Vaiṣṇava //ṭhākura...//" All Vaiṣṇavas are //ṭhākura.// They are not ordinary persons. //Ṭhākura...// We therefore address: Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. So Vaiṣṇava Prahlāda Ṭhākura. So we should always pray, //vaiṣṇava ṭhākura, tomāra kukkura boliya jānaha more.// This is... There is a song of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura: "My dear Vaiṣṇava //ṭhākura,// kindly accept me as your dog." Vaiṣṇava //ṭhākura.// As the dog, by the indication of the master, does everything very obedient, we have to learn this lesson from the dog, how to become faithful to the master. That is the instruction. In everything you can learn something. Everyone. Therefore //mahā-bhāgavata,// they accept everyone as //guru,// to learn something. Actually, from the dog we can learn this art, how to become faithful at the risk of life even. There are many instances, dog have given the life for the master. So... And we should be dog to the Vaiṣṇava. //Chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā, nistāra pāyeche kebā.//

Vaiṣṇava //aparādha// is a great offense. You know Ambarīṣa Mahārāja. He was a devotee, and he..., Durvāsā, he was very proud of his yogic power, and he committed offense at the feet of Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, and he was punished by Kṛṣṇa by sending the //sudarśana-cakra.// And he wanted help from so many---Brahmā, Viṣṇu. He could go directly to the Viṣṇuloka, but he was not pardoned. He had to come to Vaiṣṇava, Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, fall down at his lotus feet. And he, of course, Vaiṣṇava, immediately excused him. So Vaiṣṇava //aparādha// is great offense, //hātī-mātā.// So we should be very careful about Vaiṣṇava //aparādha.// We should not... //Arcye viṣṇu śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇava-jāti-buddhiḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. The //vaiṣṇava-jāti-buddhiḥ// is also another offense, great offense. Similarly, to think of //guru// as ordinary human being, that is also offense. To think of Deity as made of metal, stone, that is... These are offenses. //Sa nārakī.//

So we should be very careful about the regulative principles and follow the footprints of Vaiṣṇava. //Mahājano yena sa gataḥ.// Don't think that Prahlāda Mahārāja is ordinary boy. We should learn from Prahlāda Mahārāja how to advance in devotional service.

Thank you very much.
