====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.9.8 ======

**Pradyumna:** Translation: "Prahlāda Mahārāja prayed: How is it possible for me, who have been born in a family of asuras, to offer suitable prayers to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead? Even until now, all the demigods, headed by Lord Brahmā, and all the saintly persons could not satisfy the Lord by streams of excellent words, although such persons are very qualified, being in the mode of goodness. Then what is to be said of me? I am not at all qualified."

**Prabhupāda:**

> śrī prahlāda uvāca
> brahmādayaḥ sura-gaṇā munaya 'tha siddhāḥ
> sattvaikatāna-gatāyo vacasāṁ pravāhaiḥ
> nārādhituṁ puru-guṇair adhunāpi pipruḥ
> kiṁ toṣṭum arhati sa me harir ugra-jāteḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:8|[SB 7.9.8]]]

So //ugra-jāteḥ// means demonic family, passionate. //Ugra.// There are three qualities within this material world. Therefore it is said //guṇa-mayī. Daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. //Guṇa-mayī// means three //guṇas,// three modes of material nature: //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// So our mind is jumping. Everyone knows the nature of the mind---sometimes accepting one thing, again rejecting it. //Saṅkalpa-vikalpa.// This is the quality of the mind or nature of the mind. Sometimes the mind is jumping over //sattva-guṇa,// sometimes on the //rajo-guṇa,// sometime on the //tamo-guṇa.// In this way we are getting different types of mentality. In this way, at the time of death the mentality which is just at the moment of leaving this body will carry me to a different body of //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// This is the way of transmigration of the soul. Therefore we have to train up the mind until we get the another body. That is the art of living. So if you train up your mind simply to think of Kṛṣṇa, then you are safe. Otherwise there is chance of accidents. //Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]]. At the time of leaving this body, if we have not practiced the mind to fix up at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then there is... [break] A particular type of body we get.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja, although he does not belong to this platform of mental speculation... He is //nitya-siddha.// He has no chance, because he's always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. [loud electrical noise] [aside:] What is that? //Sa vai manaḥ...// [noise again] //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. Practice this very simple thing. Kṛṣṇa is here. We see the Deity daily and see the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Fix up your mind in that way; then you are safe. Very simple thing. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, he was also a great devotee. He was king, very responsible person, politics. But he practiced in such a way that he fixed up his mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.// This practice. Don't talk nonsense. [noise again] [aside:] What is the trouble? Take out.

So //mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. We can learn Kṛṣṇa consciousness perfectly well if we follow the //mahājanas. Mahājana// means great personality who are devotees of the Lord. They are called //mahājanas. Jana// means "person." Just like in ordinary way, in India a person is called //mahājana// who is very rich. So this //mahājana// means one who is rich in devotional service. He is called //mahājana. Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ.// So we have got Ambarīṣa Mahārāja; we have got Prahlāda Mahārāja. There are many, many kings---Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja, Parīkṣit Mahārāja---they are //rājarṣi.// So Kṛṣṇa consciousness, actually, it is meant for very great personalities.

> imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
> proktavān aham avyayam
> vivasvān manave prāhur
> manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt
> [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]

//Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. Actually, //śāstra// is not for the loafer class. For highly learned //brāhmaṇas// and highly elevated //kṣatriyas.// And the //vaiśyas// and the //śūdras,// they are not expected to become very learned in //śāstra,// but, being directed by proper //brāhmaṇa// and //kṣatriya,// they are also perfect. The first perfect class, //munayo,// as it is said, //sattvaikatāna gatayo munayo// [[books:sb:7:9:8|[SB 7.9.8]]], "Great sages..." Generally, "great sages" means //brāhmaṇas,// Vaiṣṇavas. They are situated on the //sattva-guṇa// by devotional service. //Rajas, tamo-guṇa// cannot touch them. //Naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]: the //bhadra// and //abhadra,// good and bad. So the //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa// is bad, and //sattva-guṇa// is good. If we are situated, as it is said, //sattvaikatāna-gatayo...// If you are always situated on the //sattva-guṇa,// then everything is clear to be done. //Sattva-guṇa// means //prakāṣa.// Everything is clear, full knowledge. And //rajo-guṇa// is not clear. The example is given: just like the wood. There is fire, but the first symptom of fire, wood, you'll find smoke. When you set fire in the wood, first of all smoke comes. So smoke... First of all wood, then smoke, then fire. And from fire, when you engage the fire for fire sacrifice, that is the ultimate. Everything coming from the same source, from earth. The wood is coming from wood, the smoke is coming from smoke, the fire is coming... And fire, when engaged in fire sacrifice---//svāhā//---then it is proper use of fire. If one stays in the wood platform, that is completely forgetfulness. When one stays in the smoke platform, there is little light. When one is staying in fire platform, then full light. And when the light is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, that is perfect. We have to understand like that.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja is Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava qualification is,

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

Vaiṣṇava is always humble---meek and humble. That is Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava is powerful, but still he is very meek and humble. So here is the sign. Prahlāda Mahārāja is so qualified that immediately Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva put His hand on the head: "My dear child, you have suffered so much. Now be pacified." This is Prahlāda Mahārāja's position---immediately accepted by the Lord. But he's thinking, "I am so lowborn in the family of passionate family," //ugra-jāteḥ.// He's not proud that "Now Nṛsiṁha-deva has touched my head. Ah. Who is like me? I am the greatest personality." This is not Vaiṣṇava. Sanātana Gosvāmī, when he approached Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he presented himself, //nīca jāti nīca karma nīca saṅgī:// "I am born of very low grade family, and my duties are also very low grade, and my association are also very low grade." So Sanātana Gosvāmī was born in a very respectable //brāhmaṇa// family, but because he accepted the service of Muhammadan king, actually he lost his all brahminical culture. He did not lose, but superficially it appeared, because he was mixing with the Muhammadans, eating with them, sitting with them, talking with them. But he gave up. //Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha.// He understood, "What I am doing? I am committing suicide." //Jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu.// Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says that "I am taking poison knowingly." Unknowingly one may take poison, but if knowingly one takes poison, that is very regrettable. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura said,

> hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu
> manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,
> jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu

So we are trying to preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world, but still, if people do not take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, then he is drinking poison knowingly. This is the position. He is drinking poison. That's a fact. It is not that we are imagining something, theorizing. They are charging us, "Brainwash." Yes, it is brainwash. It is... All the dirty things, stools, are there in the brain, and we are trying to wash them. That is our...

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛt satām
> [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]

The //vidhunoti,// this word, is there. //Vidhunoti// means washing. Washing. As you are hearing the message of //Śrīmad Bhāgavatam// or //Bhagavad-gītā,// the process is //vidhunoti,// washing. Actually, it is brainwashing---but for good. Washing is not bad. [laughter] That these rascals, they do not know. They are thinking, "Oh, you are making me purified? Oh, you are very dangerous." This is their... //Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopāya na śāntaye:// "To a rascal, if you give good advice, he becomes angry." //Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopāya na śāntaye.// How is it? //Payaḥ-pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa-vardhanam.// A snake-quality man is very dangerous. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has said,

> sarpaḥ krūraḥ khalaḥ krūraḥ
> sarpāt krūrataraḥ khalaḥ
> mantrauṣadhi-vaśaḥ sarpaḥ
> khalaḥ kena nivāryate

"There are two envious living entities. One is a snake, black snake, and one is a human being with the quality of black snake." He cannot see any good thing. //Sarpaḥ krūraḥ.// The snake is envious. Without any fault he bites. A snake is there on the street, and if you happen to pass by him he becomes so angry, immediately he bites. So this is the snake's nature. Similarly, there are persons like the snake. Without any fault they will accuse you. They are also snake. But Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says that "This black snake is less harmful than the man snake." Why? "Now, this black snake, by chanting some //mantra// or by some herb you can bring him under your control. But this man snake you cannot. It is not possible."

So there will be... This Hiraṇyakaśipu is also described by Prahlāda Mahārāja as a snake. When Nṛsiṁha-deva is so angry, so he will say later on that //modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā// [[books:sb:7:9:14|[SB 7.9.14]]]: "My Lord, You were very much angry on my father. Now he's finished, so there is no more reason for Your remaining angry. Be pacified. Nobody is unhappy for killing my father, be sure. So there is no cause of anguish. These all these demigods, Lord Brahmā and others, they are all Your servant. I am also Your servant's servant. So now the envious snake is killed, everyone is happy." So he gave this example that //modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā:// a //sādhu,// a saintly person, never likes killing of any living being. They are not happy... Even a small ant is killed, they are not happy: "Why ant should be killed?" What to speak of others, even a small ant. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// It may be an ant, insignificant, but at the time of death he has suffered, a Vaiṣṇava is unhappy: "Why an ant should be killed?" This is //para duḥkha-duhkhi.// But such Vaiṣṇava is happy when a snake and a scorpion is killed. //Modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatya.// So everyone is happy when a snake or scorpion is killed because they are very, very dangerous. Without any fault they bite and create havoc.

So there are these snakelike persons, they are envious about our movement; they are opposing. That is the nature. Prahlāda Mahārāja also was opposed by his father, what to speak of others. These things will happen, but we should not be disappointed, as Prahlāda Mahārāja never became disappointed although he was teased in so many ways. He was also served with poison, he was thrown amongst the serpents and he was thrown from the hill, he was put under the feet of elephant. In so many ways put... Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has instructed us that "Do not be disappointed. Kindly forbear." //Tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]: be tolerant more than the tree. I mean to say, one shall be meek and humble more than the grass. These things will happen. In one life if we execute our Kṛṣṇa consciousness attitude, even there is suffering little, don't mind. Go on with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Don't be disappointed or hopeless, even there is some trouble. That is encouraged by Kṛṣṇa in //Bhagavad-gītā, āgamāpāyino 'nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]: "My dear Arjuna, even if you feel some pain, this bodily pain, it comes and goes. Nothing is permanent, so don't care for these things. Go on with your duty." This is the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. Prahlāda Mahārāja is the practical example, and our duty is to follow the footprints of such person like Prahlāda Mahārāja.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja, such an exalted personality, the authority, he is so humble, he says, //kiṁ toṣṭum arhati sa me harir ugra-jāteḥ:// "I am born in a very ferocious family. Certainly I have inherited the quality of my father, my family, demonic family. And persons like Lord Brahmā and other demigods, they could not satisfy the Lord, and what I shall do?" A Vaiṣṇava thinks like that. Vaiṣṇava, Prahlāda Mahārāja, although he is transcendental, //nitya-siddha,// he's thinking, identifying himself with his family. Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Haridāsa Ṭhākura was not entering in the Jagannātha temple. The same thing, five hundred years ago, they did not allow anyone except Hindus in the Jagannātha temple. The same thing is still going on. But Haridāsa Ṭhākura never by force entered. He thought himself, "Yes, I am low-grade person, born in low-grade family. Why shall I disturb the //pūjārīs// and others who are directly engaged with Jagannātha? No, no." Sanātana Gosvāmī, he did not go near the temple gate. He thought himself, "By touching me, the //pūjārīs// will be impure. Better I shall not go." But Jagannātha Himself was coming to see him daily. This is the position of devotee. Devotee is very humble, but to prove the devotees' quality, the Lord takes care of them. //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]].

So we should always depend on Kṛṣṇa's assurance. In any circumstances, any dangerous position, Kṛṣṇa... //Avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa viśvāsa pālana// [Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura’s //Śaraṇāgati//]. This is surrender. Surrender means... One of the item is full faith in Kṛṣṇa, that "In execution of my devotional service there may be so many dangers, but because I have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, I am safe." This, this faith for Kṛṣṇa.

> samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ
> mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ
> bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ paraṁ padaṁ
> padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām
> [SB 10.14.58]

//Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām. Vipadam// means "dangerous position." //Padaṁ padam,// every step in this material world---//na teṣām,// not for the devotee. //Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām.// This is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Even from literary point of view so exalted. So Prahlāda Mahārāja... Just like Kavirāja Gosvāmī. He is writing //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// and presenting himself, he says,

> purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha
> jagāi mādhāi haite muñi se pāpiṣṭha
> mora nāma yei laya tāra puṇya kṣaya
> [[books:cc:adi:5:205|[Cc. Ādi 5.205]]]

Like that. The author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// he presents himself: "The lighter than the worm in the stool." //Purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha.// And in //Caitanya-līlā,// Jagāi-Mādhāi, two brothers are supposed to be most sinful, but he has also... They were also delivered. Kavirāja Gosvāmī says, "I am more sinful than the Jagāi-Mādhāi."

> jagāi madhāi haite muñi se pāpiṣṭha
> mora nāma yei laya tāra puṇya kṣaya

"I am so low grade that if somebody takes my name, whatever little pious action is there is lost." In this way he's presenting. And Sanātana Gosvāmī, presenting himself, //nīca jāti nīca karma nīca saṅga...// They are not artificial. A Vaiṣṇava actually thinks like that. That is Vaiṣṇava. He is never proud of... And just opposite number: "Oh, I have got this. I have got this. Who is equal to me? I am so rich. I am so this and that." That is the distinction.

So we have to learn this //tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā// and follow the footprint of Prahlāda Mahārāja. Then surely we shall be accepted by Nṛsiṁha-deva, Kṛṣṇa, without any failure.

Thank you very much.
