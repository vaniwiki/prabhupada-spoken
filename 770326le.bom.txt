**Prabhupāda:**
Ladies and Gentlemen, the very learned erudite scholarly speaking by our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara Singh must have created some impression in your mind, I am sure. So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, it is full of scientific knowledge. //Jñānaṁ te 'haṁ sa-vijñānaṁ pravakṣyāmy anasuyave// [[books:bg:7:2|[Bg. 7.2]]]. Kṛṣṇa said to Arjuna that "I am speaking to you knowledge, //jñānam, sa-vijñānam,// with scientific understanding." So "Why You are speaking to me?" //Jñānaṁ te 'haṁ sa-vijñānaṁ pravakṣyamy anasuyave:// "Because you are not envious. That is your qualification. You are very submissive student. Therefore I'll give you." So the dictation is coming from Kṛṣṇa, as Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara says. That's a fact. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]: "I am situated in everyone's heart."

> īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati
> bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
> yantrārūḍhāni māyayā
> [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]

So we are creating our different position. Kṛṣṇa is situated within your heart. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe.// He is pointing out, "Find out, //hṛd-deśe,// within the heart." Therefore the //yogīs,// they try to find out Paramātmā. //Dhyānāvasthita tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. The //yogīs//' business is to find out Kṛṣṇa within the core of the heart. He is there. There are many places, explained.

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te
> [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]

So He is always prepared. Kṛṣṇa comes for this purpose, to give us the real knowledge. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. Why don't you take this opportunity? That is our lamentation. Especially in India, where Kṛṣṇa personally came, where He gave..., left behind Him so valuable instruction, //Bhagavad-gītā,// why you are refusing? Why you are misinterpreting and spoiling your life and spoiling others'? Don't do it. Take it very seriously. And as soon as we are engaged---//teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam//---as soon as we submit to Kṛṣṇa and serve Him, //prīti-pūrvakam,// with love and affection... Not officially. Kṛṣṇa understands everything, that who is worshiping Him with love and affection and who is worshiping Him for some material gain. Kṛṣṇa is nobody's servant. He cannot be order-supplier. You must be prepared to supply His order or to obey His order. Then //prīti-pūrvakam:// then He will give you instruction. What instruction? //Yena mām upayānti:// "Again come back home."

So last night we were speaking of the //Bhāgavata śloka// that this life should not be spoiled like hogs and dogs. We must learn how to love Kṛṣṇa with love and affection and take instruction from Him to make our life successful.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
