**Prabhupāda:**
...condition was so, still I thought... Still I am eighty-percent not good. But twenty percent.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's very strange even now, because it doesn't seem to be anything apparently wrong, yet it's not good health. You know, like in Māyāpur you were very visibly ill, from fever and so many other things. So those visible symptoms have gone, but still, full health is not...

**Prabhupāda:**
Strength, strength. That requires a little time.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think it just requires some gradual recuperation. And also I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if there is still a chance of going to Kodaikanal for a month, you should take that opportunity.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It may be Kṛṣṇa's will that you... I think if for one month you are under the care of Dr. Ghosh in a very first class healthy weather...

**Prabhupāda:**
I think also. He is a very kind doctor. Whole family is attentive. Living is... That we have already discussed. Trees also live for many years. That is not wanted. To live for living forever, that is wanted. //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. That should be the human endeavor, not this dog race, changing condition from four legs to four wheels. This logic was never put forward, from four legs to four wheels. They are astonished.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And anthills. Yes, a very unique presentation of the philosophy. They have never heard it so nicely adapted to the modern situation. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
So they have got farther two days, so I think they will be able to do it. That, my apartment in Juhu.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, there is no question. Actually, they were ready tomorrow.

**Prabhupāda:**
Still to...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Finished completely. We'll be going there tomorrow morning to see how much they've done today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Some first-class //ḍāb// should always be in stock in the refrigerator.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Keeping cold. Yeah, the Marwaris, they always drink cold. They always keep in the refrigerator. I'll tell them to do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
This //miśri// water and //ḍāb// water.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Always ready. That will clear my urine. That I have experimented. And I don't require that exacting tablet. That tablet, by chemical reaction exacts. And when there is no urine, it exacts blood.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's what's wrong with these modern medicines. They work mechanically. They don't take consideration of the particular conditions.

**Prabhupāda:**
But this //miśri// water, //ḍāb// water, that is natural. So you keep in stock //ḍāb// water, //miśri// water always. Our this scientific program is giving me extra strength to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It seems like you are giving more stress to science in recent years than previously.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is required for convincing the modernized man. [long pause] To ordinary man, the logic "There is no God; I cannot see," that we have defied.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yeah. That you defied years ago, from the beginning.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is child, there is mother---there must be father. There is no logic. This is logic. Because without father there cannot be the child. Three things required---mother, father and child. Child means must be father and mother. Mother is there, the child is born, where is the father? We know who is father, what is His name, what is His activities. That is our advancement. And "We do not know," that means you are not a respectable, wise chap. You do not know your father's name. Any respectable man in the court or anywhere, the father's name immediately... "Your name?" "Yes." "Your father's name?" Is it not? If he does not know his father's name, that means he is not a respectable. He has no respectable position. Anyone who does not know what is God, he is just like the same child who does not know his father's name. Father must be there. That you do not know. You do not know, that is your foolishness. So anyone who does not know who is his father, what is God, he is not a respectable man. It may be that you have not seen your father, but you cannot deny, that without father you were born. That is no logic. Hmm? Is that logic?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Logical.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They don't know what the meaning is, what logic is.

**Prabhupāda:**
Orphan. Orphan means, does it, he has no father? He does not know who is his father.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Orphan means doesn't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
We are not orphans. We are taken care of by our rich father, very wise father, very rich father, able father. We are not forlorn orphans. We have got respectability. And we offer our respect to father. We depend on father. We are safe. Everyone can become safe. The opportunity is offered. If you don't take, that is your misfortune. We are offering, "Every one of you can become safe, safely protected by the father, Kṛṣṇa." //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣa...// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Why don't you take advantage? That is your misfortune. If you want to remain unfortunate, don't [indistinct] your father. These rascals, they want to remain. We have got knowledge for understanding whole philosophy. So try to convince this philosophy in Australia. And Kṛṣṇa will help you more and more. The more you try to convince others about this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the more you become enlightened.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah, I feel that... When I've done a little preaching, as soon as I speak I can feel that everything becomes clear.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Kṛṣṇa is giving you an opportunity to become more advanced. Take to that.

**Hari-śauri:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are intelligent. You have understood. Now try to transfer knowledge to the innocent person. There must be father. That you are convinced?

**Hari-śauri:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you cannot deny, "There is no God." That is not possible. The earth is the mother. They say "mother country," "mother earth." And everything is coming out from the earth. Beginning from the aquatic animals, grass, they are coming from material elements, either from water or from earth. That we can see. And they are coming from fire also, but we cannot see. But they are. It is common sense. If life can come from water, fire... Fire is also one of the elements, five elements. So from fire also... Therefore it is said, //nainaṁ dahati pāvakaḥ// [[books:bg:2:23|[Bg. 2.23]]]. Because it is coming from fire, therefore fire cannot harm the living entity. So mother is there, children are there. Where is the father? This is the logic. And the father is coming personally, "Yes, I am father." //Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. Then where is the chance for denying the existence of father? No. There is no chance, there is no logic. And the father is so rich, so powerful, so kind. And you are not taking shelter of your father. Your actual father, so great, so rich, so intelligent, so opulent. He promises, "My dear son, you surrender. I will give you all protection." He is giving protection. Still, He is assuring, and still you will not take shelter? That is intelligent? That is enviousness. Everyone can take. Everyone is suffering for misuse of their intelligence, denying the authority of God. And everyone can take advantage. We are giving that knowledge. Without any exception, everyone can take. This is our line. Accept the father, the bona fide father. Take protection from Him. He is able to give you everything. Why you are suffering? What is the logic?

**Hari-śauri:**
They are just stubborn.

**Prabhupāda:**
Stupidity. The father is there. Not only ordinary father, but the ablest, most powerful father. And we shall not take care? We shall not take care of the property of the father? It is my right to inherit the property of the father. That is natural. And I shall deny, and loiter in the street? And the greatest benefit to the human society---because the mad son is loitering in the street without any information of his father---to bring him back before the father. That is the best. He will be happy. This is our position.

**Hari-śauri:**
It is the best welfare activity.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no doubt about it. Father wants, "These rascals may come back to Me," and if anyone helps the child of the father... Father wants it, and if He tries to bring His rascal son back, to get him to the father, father is pleased, he is pleased, and our service is... Is it not? Greatest thing. So far other things, material adjustment, everything is there. Where is scarcity? Work little, you get everything. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni.// There is //anna,// food. Because you are in the material world, you have to work little---very little. //Yajñād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Keep the earth moist. You produce anything.

**Hari-śauri:**
[laughing] It's so simple.

**Prabhupāda:**
So simple.

**Hari-śauri:**
Put a little water and anything you want comes.

**Prabhupāda:**
If you perform //yajña,// the water will fall down. Even if you don't perform //yajña,// the water is there within ground. Moisten. And if you perform //yajña,// you haven't got to dig water.

**Hari-śauri:**
They have unnecessarily complicated everything, and this has made it impossible to live.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yajñād bhavanti bhūtāni.// Why you should go three hundred miles away from your home, hanging in the daily grinding, risking life? So much labor? It is not required.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
More like an ass than a human being.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is civilization? Swarms of men, Churchgaters. In the morning they are coming, just like swarms of ants. Is that right?

**Hari-śauri:**
Then in the evening again rushing home.

**Prabhupāda:**
Again going to the pigeonhole. And whole night sex, and then morning go. This is their home. And for this purpose, big, big arrangement of railway lines, this, that. Automobiles and buses and //whoosh, whoosh.// Unnecessary things. It is a life of great struggle.

**Hari-śauri:**
A death sentence with hard labor.

**Prabhupāda:**
Try to understand the philosophy more and more. Read //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Bhāgavata.// And at your best capacity try to learn. Then you will get power more and more.

**Hari-śauri:**
Even if we've no facility, if we are sincere, everything comes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Facility will be given, Krsna. He has everything. Our father is not impotent. He is potent. The overpopulation theory, it is wrong. If the father has given birth to so many children, He knows how to provide them.

**Hari-śauri:**
It is just an excuse to cover up their mismanagement.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. Our philosophy is clear.

**Indian man:**
[Gujarati]

**Prabhupāda:**
Here is switch for the fan and light.

**Indian man:**
Fan, light, balcony and plug. [discussion by men working on some electrical conections]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is settled up now.

**Indian man:**
Yes, sir. He has joined the Cabinet.

**Prabhupāda:**
He should be given some position.

**Indian man:**
No, he has been given already. I mean, he has joined the Cabinet. That means he is one of the important portfolios. [more discussion about electrical connection with men]

**Hari-śauri:**
I looked around your apartment this morning. It will definitely be ready by Wednesday morning. It's coming along very nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
Wednesday?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah. Main work now is cleaning and the kitchen.

**Prabhupāda:**
The doors have been...?

**Hari-śauri:**
The door frames are there. They are just..., it will take tomorrow to fit, and then they'll be ready. [break] Now Gargamuni's men have arrived last night, too.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, Girirāja is still on the phone, so he says this Mr. Rajda is a real devotee and is really after you. Very keen on being with you. And he's also prominent because he has been elected. So the thing is that supposing... Girirāja's idea is that he will be at Shivaji Park, and he will bring Mr. Rajda, and they will pick us up from here. And that way Mr. Rajda can ride with you and have further time to be with you in the car.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So the thing is that will get us to the //paṇḍāl,// if everything goes on schedule, by about 8:30.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Which means supposing you stay there an hour, you won't get back here till about ten.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the wrong there?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's all right? You won't be too tired or anything? Okay, well then I'll tell him. [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
First I'll go to Sydney, because this purchasing of the building has to be done in a few weeks, and we have to thoroughly check all the finance. Then after that I'll go to Melbourne, because then the court case comes up at the end of April.

**Prabhupāda:**
From Delhi?

**Hari-śauri:**
That I still have to decide. I'm going to ring tomorrow morning and see what the situation is at the consulate.

**Prabhupāda:**
From Delhi you can go to Singapore. From Singapore to Sydney.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah. There are direct flights also, that they come Delhi, Bombay and then straight to Perth and then Sydney.

**Prabhupāda:**
I left from Delhi to Bombay.

**Hari-śauri:**
If you fly from Delhi, they come Delhi, Bombay, Perth, Sydney, like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Perth. Oh.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. Instead of going to the Far East, they go straight to Perth. And then refuel and then go on.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Perth is nearer.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have been in Perth.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah, you were there for ten days about two years ago. [aside:] Prabhupāda is thinking of going to Australia?

**Devotee:**
I don't know.

**Hari-śauri:**
We had a center there for a short time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good place.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah. Generally now we just send our book distributors, and actually it is one of the best places for distribution.

**Prabhupāda:**
Amogha. Amogha goes?

**Hari-śauri:**
No, he is doing college programs mainly in Melbourne now. But the BBT distribution party, sometimes they collect three or four hundred dollars a day, each man.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Hari-śauri:**
It's very rich. Because in the north of..., northwestern Australia, there is lots of mining towns, and Perth is the only place that they can come to spend their money. So we can collect lots of money. It's very good. [some background discussion about plugs and electricity]

**Indian man:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda [Hindi].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nahī.//

**Hari-śauri:**
Eight hundred acres.

**Prabhupāda:**
Develop farms.

**Hari-śauri:**
[to Indian man] There's an eight-hundred-acre farm we are getting in Australia. The devotees are very enthusiastic for it, because in the past we haven't been able to make so many new devotees. They are not very much attracted to living in the cities in Australia. But they think that the farm... Then that will expand a lot. Practically speaking we can grow everything---fruits, all kinds of tropical fruits---and cows.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fruit, grains and milk. Vegetables. Finished, everything.

**Hari-śauri:**
Flowers too. [pause] Svarūpa Dāmodara was also suggesting that in a little while I might like to arrange a tour of the universities there, for he and Mādhava and Sadāpūta. Then it will be very good. Because there is a man that Svarūpa Dāmodara used to study under who is in La Trobe University in Melbourne. So I can arrange something there. [end]
