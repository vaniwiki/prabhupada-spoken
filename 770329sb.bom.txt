**Girirāja:**
We wish to thank the honourable Chief Minister S. B. Chavan for his beautiful talk and understanding of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Actually, we are very pleased to inform you that today we have received another letter from Russia. Acknowledging receipt of six of Śrīla Prabhupāda's books. And thanking us very much for sending these books.

[Audience applauds by clapping]

The letter further said that these books will be of very great interest to scholars and person specialising in Indian thought and culture, in Russia. So, as the honourable Chief Minister said this is further proof of the validity of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a sectarian religious faith. Just as there are so many different faiths and so many different fanatical people who are following those faiths. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is actually a universal science that has validity in all parts of the world. Actually all parts of the universe, all different universes, all different races. Not only all different races but even amongst the demigods, in all species of life. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is all auspicious for the welfare of every living entity. So therefore we say that Śrīla Prabhupāda is the greatest welfare worker in the whole universe because he is giving actual ...

[Audience applauds by clapping]

... He's actually giving relief to the living entities all over the world and this relief can... this relief can only be given by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It cannot be given by any material adjustment. So now we shall ask Śrīla Prabhupāda himself the real guru of the universe to speak before this gathering.

"Those who are interested in reviving Kṛṣṇa consciousness and increasing their love of Godhead do not like to do anything that is not related to Kṛṣṇa. They are not interested in mingling with people who are busy maintaining their bodies, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. They are not attached to their homes, although they may be householders. Nor are they attached to wives, children, friends or wealth. At the same time, they are not indifferent to the execution of their duties. Such people are interested in collecting only enough money to keep body and soul together."

Purport: "Whether he is an impersonalist or a devotee, one who is actually interested in advancing spiritually should not mingle with those who are simply interested in maintaining the body by means of the so-called advancement of civilization. Those who are interested in spiritual life should not be attached to homely comforts in the company of wife, children, friends and so forth. Even if one is a //gṛhastha// and has to earn his livelihood, he should be satisfied by collecting only enough money to maintain body and soul together. One should not have more than that nor less than that. As indicated herein, a householder should endeavor to earn money for the execution of //bhakti-yoga---śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam/ arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. A householder should lead such a life that he gets full opportunity to hear and chant. He should worship the Deity at home, observe festivals, invite friends in and give them //prasāda.// A householder should earn money for this purpose, not for sense gratification."

"When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification, by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another."

Purport: "Begging, borrowing and stealing to live for sense gratification is condemned in this verse because such consciousness leads one to a dark, hellish condition. The four sinful activities are illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. These are the means by which one gets another material body that is full of miseries. In the //Vedas// it is said: //asaṅgo hy ayaṁ puruṣaḥ.// The living entity is not really connected with this material world, but due to his tendency to enjoy the material senses, he is put into the material condition. One should perfect his life by associating with devotees. He should not become further implicated in the material body."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

The real problem of life is not to adjust things materially, change from one form of government to another form of government. These things are temporary things. It will not give relief. And this fighting between one party with another amongst the politicians or the //kṣatriyas// or the administrators, they are going on perpetually. That is not a very new thing. So we should not forget our real life. For ruling over to get political predominance, there may be fighting. That is natural. It is going on. Just like the Battle of Kurukṣetra---it is a fighting between two section of the same family, who will rule over. So there was fighting, but at the same time, they did not lose Kṛṣṇa culture. That is the important point. Similarly, India has got a great culture, background, Vedic culture, or Kṛṣṇa culture. Vedic culture means Kṛṣṇa culture, and Kṛṣṇa culture means Vedic culture. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. So study //Veda// or //Vedānta// means to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is the purpose. //Vedaiś ca sarvair. Veda// means "knowledge," and //anta// means "end." //Vedānta.// Vyāsadeva, Śrīla Vyāsadeva, he has given us the //Vedānta// philosophy. What is the purpose? That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi-sanniviṣṭo
> mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca
> vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaṁ
> vedānta-vid vedānta-kṛt ca aham
> [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]

So we should take care of very seriously about this culture of //Bhagavad-gītā.// This is India's property. This Vedic culture, instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā,// was spoken on the land of Bhārata-varṣa, although it is not meant for a particular class of men or a class of people or in a particular country. It is meant for everyone---//manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]---especially for the human being. So our request is that we may fight amongst ourself for political predominance, but why should we forget our real culture, Vedic culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness? That is our request. All important men, leaders of the society, they should take this Vedic culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and not only preach in their own country, but all over the world. [break] If you don't take it, there is a great risk. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> aśradaddhānāḥ puruṣā
> dharmasyāsya parantapa
> māṁ aprāpya eva nivartante
> mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani
> [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]

Kṛṣṇa says personally. He comes, //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]], for the benefit of the human society. Because //dharmasya glānir. Dharma// is meant for the human society. //Dharma// is not meant for the cats and dogs. They have no //dharma.// You cannot have any religious principle or institution in the cat society or dog society. //Dharmeṇa hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ// [//Hitopadeśa//]. Therefore when human society becomes devoid of //dharma,// then it is animal society. It is no longer human society.

And what is that //dharma,// I have several times spoken. //Dharmaṁ tu sāksād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. //Dharma// means the law or the words given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is //dharma.// That is the shortcut definition of //dharma.// "You should do this; you should not do this." Just like the government gives us law, "Keep to the right." So that is law. Although it is very simple thing, "Keep to the right," but that is law. Similarly, what Kṛṣṇa says... Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If we take it for proper utilization of our this great boon of life, human form of life, then we become //dharmī,// and our life is successful.

What Kṛṣṇa says, that is not at all difficult. Even a child can perform. What Kṛṣṇa said? //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Very simple thing. Kṛṣṇa says, "Always think of Me." What is the difficulty? Even a child can think of Kṛṣṇa. If he goes to the temple and if he understands from his parents that "Here is the Deity, Kṛṣṇa," it impresses. He understands, "Here is Kṛṣṇa," because he is simple. So he can also think of Kṛṣṇa: "I went to the temple. I saw Kṛṣṇa very nicely dressed, very nicely decorated. Very nice foodstuff was offered, and I got the //prasādam.//" Where is the difficulty? //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto.// And if you go regularly to see Kṛṣṇa in the temple and to remember Him, then you become a //bhakta.// It doesn't require that you have to pass M.A. examination to become a //bhakta,// or you have to become a very learned scholar. But because that is the end of knowledge. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa, your all Vedic knowledge is perfect. //Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [Nārada Pañcarātra]. If you have understood Hari, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //tapasā tataḥ kim,// then where is the necessity of //tapasya?// You have achieved the result of //tapasya.//

Because to understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy.

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

To understand Kṛṣṇa he requires great //tapasya.// There is no doubt about it. But if some way or other you have understood Kṛṣṇa, then //ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [Nārada Pañcarātra]. There is no more need of //tapasya.// Your ultimate goal of life is already achieved. And //nārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim.// And you have performed great austerities, penances, but you do not know what is Kṛṣṇa---then it is useless waste of time. //Nārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim.// What is the value of your //tapasya?// Real thing you do not understand. So //ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim, nārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim, antar bahir yadi haris tataḥ kim.// If you have learned these four principles as instructed by Bhagavān, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru...// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Very simple thing. //Antar bahir,// within and without, if you have learned to think of Kṛṣṇa, //antar bahir yadi haris tapasā,// then where is the use of //tapasya?// It is already achieved. Because you are thinking always, externally and internally, Kṛṣṇa. And //nārādhito yadi haris. Antar bahir yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim.// If you have not learned the art of thinking Kṛṣṇa externally and internally, then what is the use of your so-called //tapasya?//

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very easy. If it cannot be introduced, I mean to say, in large scale, collectively, individually anyone can learn and take the Vedic wisdom. Anyone, even a child. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakta.// And what is the result? The result is //mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]. Anyone who is doing this, //asaṁśaya,// "Without any doubt, you are coming to Me." That is the aim of life, how to go back to home, back to Godhead. Not to join here in the dog's race. That is not aim of life. It will not make me happy, anyone happy.

> guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ
> ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā
> kartāham iti manyate
> [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]

The nature's law is working very stringently. You cannot avoid it.

> mama māyā duratyayā
> mām eva ye prapadyante
> māyām etāṁ taranti te
> [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]

So these things are there. I can quote many verses like that. But Kṛṣṇa consciousness is very easy, and everyone should become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the aim of life. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. We are trying to adjust things externally, but that will never be fulfilled. //Durāśayā.// This is hope against hope. You cannot do anything independently because you are fully under the clutches of //māyā. Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati.// Kṛṣṇa says, "My dear Arjuna, Īśvara, the Supreme Lord, is situated in the core of everyone's heart." He is not far away. And He is observing. In the //Upaniṣads// it is said that there are two birds on one tree. One is eating the fruit, and the other is witnessing. The witnessing bird is Kṛṣṇa, and the eating bird is the //jīvātmā.//

So Kṛṣṇa is so friendly that He always lives with us just to turn our face towards Kṛṣṇa. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. What is His business? He is simply waiting for the time when we shall turn our face to Kṛṣṇa. That is His business. But unfortunately, we do not want Kṛṣṇa. We want something which is not Kṛṣṇa. That is our disease. Still, Kṛṣṇa is giving us facility. //Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Kṛṣṇa gives intelligence, //mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]], that "You are My part and parcel. Why you are struggling so hard in this material world? Come to Me. I will give you all protection." //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He is ready. But I'll not do. That's my obstinacy. At that time what Kṛṣṇa will do? He is affectionate father. "All right, what do you want to do?" "I want to do like this." "All right." //Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. He immediately orders //prakṛti---mayādhyakṣena prakṛteḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]---"This living entity wants a body like this. So give him a body like that." //Yantra.// That is called //yantra.// It is a machine. This body is the machine. And therefore we are changing, one body to another, //yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.// This is our business.

So if I am now in a //yantra,// Mercedes car, and suppose next life I ride on another //yantra// which is four-legged dog, then what is the benefit of this kind of struggle for existence? But that is going on. Therefore Kṛṣṇa warns, //aśraddhadhānāḥ puruṣā dharmasyasya parantapa mām aprāpya.// "The aim of life was to achieve Me," Kṛṣṇa says, "but the result is, because he does not hear what I say," //mām aprāpya nivartante,// "again goes back," //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// This material world means to take birth and die. That is called //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// Now I am born as Indian or as //brāhmaṇa// or something like that. The next life, there is no guarantee. Kṛṣṇa does not say that there is guarantee. Kṛṣṇa says //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ:// you have to change your body. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ dhīras tatra na muhyati// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]].

So our request is that such a great science of..., for the human society, for understanding the problems of life, how to solve it, how to achieve the greatest success in life... We have got this in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Why should we neglect it? What is the reason? Other things may go on---this political fight or some fight. Fighting. This is a world of fighting. //Āgamāpāyino 'nityaḥ tams titikṣasva bhārata. Mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]. This is world of //śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ.// You cannot avoid it. So //tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata.// Just try to tolerate. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also says the same thing:

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api suhiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

We have to become tolerant than the grass on the street and forbearing more than the trees. In this way we have to tolerate whatever is going on in this material world. Tolerate does not mean unnecessarily we shall suffer. As far as possible, let us struggle, but we should not forget our real business. That is human life. Real business is that I am part and parcel of God. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūta// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. Some way or other, I am fallen in this material condition. There is a Bengali poet, he has sung, //anādi-karama-phale paḍi, bhavārṇava-jale, tarivāre na dheki upāya.// "Somehow or other I am fallen in this material ocean and struggling for existence." Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore prays... He does not pray for any material benefit. He is teaching us, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]: "My Lord, Jagadīśa, I do not want any material happiness or wealth," //na dhanaṁ na janam,// "or great followers," //na sundarīṁ kavitām,// "or beautiful wife." These are the demands of the //karmīs:// "I must have wealth, I must have position, I must have beautiful home, beautiful wife." But Caitanya Mahāprabhu denies. He says, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye.// He does not want even //mukti.// Because He says next line that //mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]: "Life after life simply let Me remain Your devotee."

> [[books:cc:antya:20:32|[Cc. Antya 20.32, Śikṣāṣṭaka 5]]]

So we have got such vast knowledge for achieving the goal of life. It is India. Why should we neglect? Why we should become so foolish that forget our real purpose of life and engage in will-o'-the-wisp struggle for existence, which will never be successful? Why this misconception of life? At least, there must be this institution of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in India so that not only the Indians, but all outside India, they should come and learn what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [applause] So it is already explained. We are trying to develop this institution in Bombay. Bombay is the best city in India, and people are also very advanced, enlightened. So let us combine together and develop this institution for the whole human society. That is our ambition. It is not for any sect or any creed or any particular class of men. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. It is for the human society, and we have got this opportunity of human body. A Bengali poet sings, //hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu. Manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā, jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu.// "My Lord, I have wasted my this valuable life, human form of life, because I did not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

So if you do not take Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously in this human form of life, then you must know that you are drinking poison knowingly. Don't neglect it. Try to understand. It is based on science, philosophy, //śāstra,// knowledge. It is not a blind faith. And we are prepared to answer you in any way. The method is very simple; even a child can take advantage of it. Not that we are manufacturing. It is sanctioned in the //śāstra. Kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ// [SB 12.3.51]. This is the statement by Śukadeva Gosvāmī to Mahārāja Parīkṣit. He describes the faults of this Kali-yuga. It is just like the ocean. //Kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann hy asti eka mahān...// But there is one very great advantage, he said. What is that? //Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet// [SB 12.3.51]. If you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// then you become free from all contamination and go back to home, back to Godhead.

Thank you very much.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Some people have questions. Do you want to answer them?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No need? //Kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not know. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you very much. //Jaya.//
