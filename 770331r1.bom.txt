**Prabhupāda:**
...Bengal is little educated. In the Bengali, it is called rural relationship.

**Lokanātha:**
//Prasādam// distribution could be very successful.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So Śrīla Prabhupāda, generally visitors will not come up here, right? Because now that Girirāja is here, if you can explain to him what, you know, the policy as it should be...

**Prabhupāda:**
You explain.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda said that he will go once a week to the //darśana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I shall go daily in the morning. At seven. And I'll stay there half an hour or more than half an hour.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Guru-pūjā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Those who are visitors, they can see me. And for lecturing, on Sunday I shall lecture. You can fix up time, which time. But Sunday I shall speak from //Bhāgavatam.// This is general program. And if it is required some special, that is another thing. So what is the use of inviting visitors here?

**Girirāja:**
I agree with that policy.

**Prabhupāda:**
What do you think, Dr. Sharma?

**Dr. Sharma:**
I agree. Very urgent or some special thing, then it can be done. Otherwise not, I don't think.

**Prabhupāda:**
Generally, people come to visit: "How are you? How you are feeling?" And it takes half an hour even. So what is the use of wasting time like that, "How are you?"

**Dr. Sharma:**
Yes, they should be told that there is actually...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone knows that I am not feeling well.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
For that they can come in the morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. If they actually want to see me, I am going there. They can see me. For half an hour, more than half an hour. And for talking... There is no need of talking, "How are you? How you are feeling?" This is not talking.

**Gargamuni:**
Instead, they can buy some of your books downstairs.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is waste of time. At least, I want to stop this, to answer all these things, "How you are...?"

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That will conserve a great deal of energy if you don't have to meet with people.

**Prabhupāda:**
And balance time saved, I can do the work.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's good. Practically everyone has Sunday as a holiday. So if they want to hear you speak, they are all free to come Sunday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is general program. And if there is some special, that we shall do. [pause] I am all right so long I am able to write. But I do not stop writing book unless I am not all right. So generally arrange like that, and specifically, we shall meet once daily, half an hour to one hour. There is no difficulty. But not continually people coming. That is bad.

**Girirāja:**
I agree with that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, people respect that, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It is not unusual that someone should have a program like that. Rather, they take advantage of your very, you know, compassion and mercy, but they used to come two or three hours every evening and sit.

**Devotee:**
They'll appreciate it more. Now you are working on Tenth Canto, so you can stop seeing other people. They'll appreciate that. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
I think I shall be able to work from today. Now I have got very nice place, full freedom. So there will be no difficulty.

**Girirāja:**
Actually, even coming at seven in the morning, you can begin that after some time if you want to rest more.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that, seven?

**Girirāja:**
The program to come at seven in the morning, so if you want to gain more strength for some days, you can begin that program also after a few days.

**Prabhupāda:**
After some time. No, I can go. Provided the lift is working. [laughter] Otherwise I shall be obliged. What can be done?

**Gargamuni:**
Will you be walking, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Walking should be stopped at least for some time. And if I walk, I may walk on the roof.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's very nice on the roof.

**Devotee:**
And there can be a garden on the roof.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, some flower tubs, and... You have already done? No.

**Girirāja:**
No. Not on the roof.

**Prabhupāda:**
Some flower tubs.

**Girirāja:**
Well, we have potted plants, but actually, we want to make like landscape.

**Gargamuni:**
The lift doesn't go up to the roof, though.

**Prabhupāda:**
It doesn't matter. One...

**Girirāja:**
We can take by palanquin.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, one story I can go. Not now, but I can go. So you are trying so much for my comfort. I do not know whether I shall be able to repay you. Then I shall try my best. It is not possible to repay your debts, that so kind. So I can simply pray to Kṛṣṇa to give His blessings to you so that you may remain very steady in devotional service and preach this cult all over the world. Otherwise, I have no other means. Without your help I could not do anything. So you are very much kind. Kindly continue your cooperation. //Paropakāra.// This is the movement for //paropakāra.// I have got report from our other temples all over the world. They are doing very nice, is it not? Other temples outside India, they are doing very nice.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Especially in New York, Los Angeles. In all cities. You can give report. You know very well. They are doing all right?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I came about more than a month now.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. When you were there.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh, yes. In Washington and in Atlanta and Florida...

**Prabhupāda:**
That standard should be maintained. Everywhere.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It will be nicer now after the court case. All the devotees must be very enthused now, because court was very favorable, New York case.

**Prabhupāda:**
How is Vṛndāvana going on?

**Dhanañjaya:**
By your mercy, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [indistinct] is there. Our community is growing very nicely. The festival is very successful. Everyone enjoyed, oh, very much---//kīrtanas// and all the different programs.

**Lokanātha:**
At Janmasthāna we had program last year, with four days having programs. Same as we have here---//kīrtanas,// discourses, dramas, cinemas, //prasādam// distribution, book distribution. Many, many people came. Whole ground was...

**Prabhupāda:**
This year or last year?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This year. Over ten thousand people came.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are, after all, Mathurā men, after Kṛṣṇa. They have got natural love for Kṛṣṇa.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Also the decoration was very gorgeous in the temple. All the domes were lit, and in the front door two //cakras// and one lotus flower, opening and closing. Thousands of people were coming daily to attend it. They had heard that all the American devotees had come. So they were very anxious to see the arrangements made. Also the signs are up on the road, Bhaktivedanta Swami Marga. Big marble plaque. Very nice stone fitting. In two places on the road.

**Prabhupāda:**
On all the roads?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Everyone knows, this is now Bhaktivedanta Swami Marga. No longer Chattikara Road.

**Prabhupāda:**
But you have printed Bhaktivedanta Marga.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhaktivedanta...

**Dhanañjaya:**
Swami.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...Swami Marga.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. In the book, I see. Why?

**Devotee:**
Bhaktivedanta Road.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Well, you see, what happened was, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they put in Hindi Bhaktivedanta Swami Marga. And the marble cutters, they made //mārga// instead of road. Bhaktivedanta Swami Marga

**Prabhupāda:**
That doesn't matter.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But //mārga// is now the Indian style.

**Prabhupāda:**
I am not speaking of that. You have printed in the book, Bhaktivedanta Marga, not Bhaktivedanta Swami Marga.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You left the word //Swami// out.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I followed [indistinct].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Anyone can be Bhaktivedanta. Bhaktivedanta is mentioned in the...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, apart from that, actual name is Bhaktivedanta //Swami// Marga, but you have made Bhaktivedanta. Why?

**Indian man:**
//Swami// is omitted.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why //Swami// is omitted? That is a mistake on your part.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Everyone, too, is remarking how beautiful the painting is inside. These Rajasthani artists, they are going on with the painting on the upper portion of the temple, the //darśana-maṇḍapa.// And everyone is remarking how gorgeous the arrangement is.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, it is gorgeous.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Even the //vyāsāsana// is very beautiful. The most beautiful I have ever seen anywhere in the movement.

**Prabhupāda:**
They come to see the painting.

**Dhanañjaya:**
They come to see everything now---the painting, the way the Deities are dressed. Now we are offering many sets of clothing for the Deities. We have offered already four sets of new clothing to the Deities. And everyone comes to see the beauty of the arrangement in the //śṛṅgāra//---the clothing and the painting. Everything is improving so nicely. They are becoming very...

**Prabhupāda:**
If you become nice devotee, everything will be improved. //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. The more you increase your devotional service, everything will be increased. Who expected such temple here? Hmm? You wanted from me fourteen //lakhs.// I had no fourteen hundred even. With so much difficulty we collected the money. Bali-mardana sent from New York ten //lakhs.// Girirāja, you were from the very beginning? No. At that time you were in Calcutta.

**Girirāja:**
I came after about two weeks.

**Prabhupāda:**
Our Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja, he refused to take charge; Madhudviṣa. I was little hopeless. And Brahmānanda encouraged me, "I will do." And then silent. "Give him fifty dollars." And his policy was that where he will get this money from? He is beggar. Fourteen //lakhs?// Whatever one, two //lakhs// he gives, that's all. Swallowed. I told him frankly that "I have no so much money. Immediately I can collect four //lakhs.// I shall give you two //lakhs// against your money, and two //lakhs// I shall spend for construction. Of course, within three years I shall fill up." He thought that whatever two //lakh,// one //lakh// comes, he will not be able to... That was his... I knew that I had no money, but I never thought that "I shall not be able to do." That I was confident. So it's a great history. So many things happened. It is all Rādhā-Rāsavihārī's //līlā.// Otherwise it is... Now next program, yours. Make a strong party, and you travel extensively all over the world, amongst the scientists. And whatever amount is required, I shall spend. What do you expect monthly expenditure will be without any difficulty, a whole party? How many you want to travel?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
To start with, three of us should travel. Three scientists can travel together, and if it is necessary...

**Prabhupāda:**
You are recruiting other scientists also?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Supposing you were recruiting, how many would you make ideally as a team?

**Prabhupāda:**
And here is one philosopher also. He knows perfectly well English, Sanskrit, //Vedas.// Where is he? I don't find him.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Prem Yogi?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He is in his room.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
About five will be ideal. The biggest group will be too expensive, and sometimes...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, make five.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, five.

**Prabhupāda:**
Recruit two others and make it at least five, and travel all over the world. All institutions, all universities, all scientists. If you have got commodity, deliver. It is not a bluff, gold manufacturing. It is not that. Actual fact. That day, your presentation was very nice. Any scientist will be convinced by such presentation, learned speeches. So now at least five men, and estimate what will be the expenditure. I shall arrange. Don't worry.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I will submit that at the time of opening our this temple, and we will make...

**Prabhupāda:**
For expenditure there is no worry. What will be the rough expenditure?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It will depend on what part of the world we are traveling.

**Prabhupāda:**
You travel all over the world. Why part of the world? We are not preaching part. //Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126] we are concerned. Nothing shall be left over.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja can give us some hints how much it costs, travel hints, some experience in traveling.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Maybe ten thousand dollars.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sanctioned. I will give you ten thousand. Do it.

**Devotee:**
A year?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
A month.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ten thousand dollars means one //lakh// of rupees. So we shall save from that luxury department. And this is solid work. Yes. It must be done. Without any hesitation, without any impediment. That will increase our prestige of the movement. And go in good dress, because people...

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In suits.

**Prabhupāda:**
In suit, yes. You get first dress, then address. [laughter] But //tilaka// must be there. You dress like up-to-date gentlemen, but //tilaka// must be there. That is our trademark.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Some hair for him is all right? Little bit of hairs? Or a shaved head?

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't think hair is required. Nowadays many gentlemen shaven.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Shaved head.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Many gentlemen. I have seen many Russian scholars and politicians, they shave clean.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There is a very big American actor who always has a shaved head. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is now fashion, shaved head. But if you think it is impediment, you can have hair.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In India it is all right, but in the West, especially in the United States...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you keep hair. I have no objection. That should not be an impediment. Whichever you determine. But //tilaka// is objectionable?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh, no. //Tilaka// we can always have.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. Then it is all right. You belong to Hare Kṛṣṇa. That should be there. That cannot be missing[?].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I would use //tilaka// many times when I was doing my thesis, also like this. But in giving lectures, especially amongst the scientists, sometimes if we come with head shaved, sometimes they think it very strange. We can do it when...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no. Don't disturb them, that "These are strange people." No, we don't want that. But we must have our position. //Tilaka// is our position. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's stricture. He would not see one face if there is no //tilaka.// He used to say it is cremation ground. Yes, without //tilaka. Pasanta mukha.//[?] //Tilaka// must be there. And so far dress is concerned, you can dress up to the taste of the modern people. So what is your breakfast time here?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Nine o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nine o'clock?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you very much. //Jaya.// [end]
