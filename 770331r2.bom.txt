**Prabhupāda:**
...and bangle, and //tink-tink-tink.// Then he took away another bangle, again //tink-tink-tink.// Another bangle, again //tink-tink-tink.// When there was only one, there was no //tink-tink-tink.//

**Hari-śauri:**
Right.

**Prabhupāda:**
So remain always one and read books. Then there will be no noise. And as soon as you become two, //tink-tink-tink.// That I don't want.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, it won't happen. If anyone comes to see me, I'll go out of the apartment.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That you can make reception there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**

**Prabhupāda:**

**Prabhupāda:**

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very good. We'll see to that, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
