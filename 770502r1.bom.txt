**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Your wife...

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Indian lady (1):**
[Hindi] [Hindi conversation]

**Girirāja:**
This is //prasādam// from the Deity.

**Shri Narayan:**
Yes. [Hindi] [Hindi conversation about working in Dubai]

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
Indians are intelligent... [Hindi] Indians... So, but they have sacrificed everything for..., to imitate the Westerners. But Indian [Hindi] knowledge... But we have locked it. Our knowledge, we have locked it, and we are trying to imitate.

**Shri Narayan:**
Yes, true. Imitation is not good at all. We must keep our originality and ancient culture.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] Vedic culture [Hindi] [Hindi conversation] With great praise our books are. [Hindi conversation]

Girirāja: Twenty-three different languages.

**Shri Narayan:**
Twenty-three different languages. [Hindi conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
Within ten years I have already written eighty-four books.

**Shri Narayan:**
Eighty-four books. [rest of conversation in Hindi, with few interspersed English words] [to Girirāja] You understand what I said? Somebody should come with the [indistinct], the literature. Not the whole book, or the book, but some basic literature with a catalog of difficulties which are being faced from the government side. Then it will be easier. [Hindi] [Hindi conversation, with few interspersed English words as they take //prasāda//] Rishikesh this side, from the hill point of view, will be better than [indistinct]. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Bogilalji, he has got his house near Rishikesh?

**Girirāja:**
Yeah. I think near Haridwar.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what he recommends there.

**Shri Narayan:**
Rishikesh is much better.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is there now?

**Girirāja:**
Ah, I'm not sure.

**Prabhupāda:**
So his son is there.

**Girirāja:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can bring one blank.

**Girirāja:**
The empty plate, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What they cannot take. [Hindi conversation] It will be very great pleasure. [Hindi conversation] Daily five to six //lakhs.//

**Shri Narayan:**
Five to six //lakhs// net income. Profit. Net income.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nāhi// net income. Sale proceeds.

**Shri Narayan:**
Sale, sale.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] Donation, //nāhi.// Sales proceeds from my books. [Hindi conversation]

**Indian man (1):**
Most of the books are sold in America or the Western countries or in our country as well?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] Western countries. [Hindi] All universities, libraries, professors, they take it.

**Girirāja:**
[to guests] Is there anything you can't take? [referring to //prasāda// leftovers]

**Shri Narayan:**
Whatever comes to take in this...

**Girirāja:**
I mean don't want to take.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [pause] So for all your difficulties, you approach Shriman Narayan. He is the right person. [Hindi conversation, with few interspersed English words]

**Girirāja:**
We got the IOD today.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā.// Then should begin. [Hindi, explaining about the 10 ft of disputed land and the Municipality] [Hindi conversation] So that question they have now satisfied? That road?

**Girirāja:**
Well, they're waiting for us to make an official application. But on this IOD, the condition was there that we have to hand over that 10 ft. But that was crossed out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then we can begin. That's all right.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Would they like to wash their hands?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You can wash. There is basin. You can wash. [Hindi] No, if you want to wash your hands, this... [Hindi] [indistinct aside] [Hindi conversation] [break] [to Girirāja] Do you understand what he is saying?

**Girirāja:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
For Indian government, he will help you. For local, he will help. For they are our well-wishers. So we approach these two persons for all difficulties.

**Shri Narayan:**
Yes. We should be kept in touch what the difficulties are. I can talk to Morarji [Hindi], foreign minister... [Hindi conversation about permanent residenceship position]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi about going to Rishikesh]

**Shri Narayan:**
Dalmia, he can make arrangements. He has lot of influence in that area. His own house. [Hindi conversation]

[Shri Narayan and his associates leave]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Everybody's appreciating this view. All the ladies were standing on the balcony.

**Prabhupāda:**
So immediately contact Jayadal and Dalmia, and he has got a nice house. We go to Rishikesh immediately. It is very nice. Or Patel.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Or Bhogilal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then we haven't got to go Kashmir.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So first we'll contact Bhogilal, because he's in the city. If he cannot arrange, then we'll immediately contact Jayadal. Yeah, they're such close friends...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...they'll immediately do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And Rishikesh is known to be very good. Gaṅgā is there.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we can go there immediately. That decided.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All right, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rishikesh is appealing. To drink Ganges water...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
...and take bathing in the Ganges.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, I immediately feel attracted to going there...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...'cause it's a holy city. These other places were not so... This Rishikesh is holy city.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is nearer.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So tomorrow I'm going into the city, anyway. I'll go and meet either Bhogilal or Pranlal. I have nice acquaintance with them, so I can meet them. Even if Bhogilal is not here, Pranlal is here.

**Prabhupāda:**
One of them can...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He can do also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So I'll make arrangements. Dr. Sharma is waiting for me, Śrīla Prabhupāda, so...

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, you go now.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I should attend.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are free. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
