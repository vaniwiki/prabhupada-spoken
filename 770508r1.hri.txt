**Prabhupāda:**
If you have got the name, so why not reply to each one, with the letter...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, I see.

**Prabhupāda:**
...that "We are intending to make a huge planetarium. If you can help us?"

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Mentioning the Fifth Canto, //Bhāgavatam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Exactly to the description of Fifth Canto, we want.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How will we get their addresses?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Or I can write to Mr. Chandali[?].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's one thing we could do. I haven't seen the article, but he must have spoken at some institution or some meeting. We can write a letter to the secretary of that institution and meeting, telling them what we intend to do and to forward us a list of the people who attended and their addresses. And in that way we can... Should... Of course, I can do it, but do you want us to do it, or should Surabhi's office do it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Surabhi?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, he's already got letters like this, and he's receiving letters from people. He has... I don't mind doing it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Surabhi... No. I shall deal it personally.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All right, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise there is chance of being cheated.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, okay. So then...

**Prabhupāda:**
I know what are things, but still, they are specially specialists.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Little confirmation...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's all right. I know everything.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think, more than anything, you want confirmation just in case... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is my request, that I may remain unconscious... [break] ... //kapha-pitta-vāyu.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Conscious, unconscious and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. But never put me in hospital. You can refuse, that "This is our Guru Mahārāja's order." Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Bās.// Let me die peacefully.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When Caitanya Mahāprabhu was unconscious, all that His disciples would do is they would chant in His ear.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So we'll take that example. Please don't ever doubt that. We will never let them. It will be over my dead body.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is my order. If I become unconscious... Otherwise... [Bengali]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali] [end]
