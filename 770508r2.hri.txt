**Prabhupāda:**
"I don't want your teaching."

**Indian lady (1):**
Would you say that I accept duty of the...

**Prabhupāda:**
You understand first of all. Whatever the rascal father was teaching, he was refusing. That is the quarrel between the father and the son.

**Indian man (2):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is the responsibility of some person towards the father who has given the material body to him?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, don't try to understand in a minute. You read all these books. But attentively, if the child has form, the father must have form. There is no doubt of it. And what is that form? That you have to understand. And his question, the father was a demon, but the child was not demon because he refused to follow that demon father. That was his only fault.

**Indian man (3):**
Prabhupāda, if I am allowed, I could just say what Guru Nanak said. He said [Hindi]. He said, "Lord Father does not have the cycle of birth." Therefore, I mean my interpretation...

**Prabhupāda:**
So [Hindi].

**Indian man (3):**
My interpretation...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why interpretation? [Hindi] //Na jāyate na mriyate vā// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. [Hindi] Birth, death, old age. [Hindi conversation] [pause]

**British devotee:**
Should we stop now, Śrīla Prabhupāda? It's quarter to seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**British devotee:**
So the people now have been staying here...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You can make an announcement.

**British devotee:**
Yes. Everyone can please take leave now. Śrīla Prabhupāda now has to get ready to leave. He's going to Agra tomorrow.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] //prasada.//

**British devotee:**
So if you can come to the door, stand at the door... That's the door, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**British devotee:**
Bhūmipati, could you help there?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// Thank you very much.

**British devotee:**
That man would like you to [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
I'll go. [break] [indistinct]

**Person:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
...give me any service? [indistinct] ...enough. Somebody becomes an... alright. [indistinct] ...brain. ...so kind. This sudras... the number of sudras have created this spoiled situation so bad. [end]
