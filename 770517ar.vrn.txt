**Prabhupāda:**
So I cannot speak. I am feeling very weak. I was to go to other places like Chandigarh program, but I cancelled the program because the condition of my health is very deteriorating. So I preferred to come to Vṛndāvana. If death takes place, let it take here. So there is nothing to be said new. Whatever I have to speak, I have spoken in my books. Now you try to understand it and continue your endeavor. Whether I am present or not present doesn't matter. As Kṛṣṇa is living eternally, similarly, living being also lives eternally. But //kīrtir yasya sa jīvati// [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita]: "One who has done service to the Lord lives forever." So you have been taught to serve Kṛṣṇa, and with Kṛṣṇa we'll live eternally. Our life is eternal. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. A temporary disappearance of this body, it doesn't matter. Body is meant for disappearance. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. So live forever by serving Kṛṣṇa. Thank you very much.
