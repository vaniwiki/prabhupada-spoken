**Prabhupāda:**
Now you can discuss. [Hindi] [end]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi about Jayānanda] ...glorious death. [Hindi] What was his age?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayānanda was about thirty-eight or forty.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] I was very anxious to print my books. So he was the first one to come forward, a five hundred[?] dollar check. [Hindi conversation] What is this cloth is hanging?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It says, "Welcome, Śrīla Prabhupāda."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Where is Gopāla?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He went back to Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He was in Delhi the day before yesterday.

**Indian man (1):**
He came here only for one day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He was in Delhi only about two days ago. He'll be coming back here, he said, in about one week from now---one week to ten days.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] You can keep here. When Mr. Bose has come?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Mr. Ghosh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bose.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Oh. Just three days ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
How long he'll stay?

**Akṣayānanda:**
He wants to stay.

**Prabhupāda:**
He wants, but I don't think he wants. [laughs] It is known to me.

**Mr. Bose[?]:**
No, I'll stay. I promised them.

**Prabhupāda:**
You promised them? [laughter]

**Mr. Bose[?]:**
By blessings.

**Prabhupāda:**
This time little advanced he has become there, Bose... Shaven-headed. [Hindi] His father was //sannyāsī.// He's the first //sannyāsī// of Gauḍīya Maṭha.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
His father was the first //sannyāsī// of Gauḍīya Maṭha, my Godbrother, Bhakti-pradīpa-tīrtha. He was very kindly. He liked me very much. [Hindi conversation] He has come. Just try to train him. [Hindi conversation] The son must be there. You are son of a very big man. The father's quality must be there.

**Indian man (2):**
[Hindi] I... Hardly I endorse. Without Your Grace, a man like me, never. I realize your now...

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Indian man (2):**
He's so kind to me.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Everything Prabhupāda does is [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
He is ideal //sannyāsī.// I think he's younger than you.

**Indian man (2):**
Yes. As I am engrossed in this way. It is only through his grace I got extricated. It was impossible. I have got all opportunity. Still, the world has attract me in such a way that several times I promised to him; I could not extricate myself. But this time, I really strict and I last only... That strictness I found because I know it now.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's coming from government service. //Ācchā.//

**Indian man (2):**
Because I know it now. And my father, most dearest Godbrother. He has got a very, our nickname [indistinct]. He's a great poet.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Kavi.

**Indian man (2):**
Kavi. In the mission only he is to poet, no other //sannyāsīs// and nobody, even not Prabhupāda, any //sannyāsī.// But he realized it. How much love he saw, Prabhupāda. Yesterday I spoke, yesterday night. The greatest living export that has been brought down by God, it is what Bhaktivedanta Prabhupāda has... He's such a living export, Indian culture... [Hindi] ...in the world.

> pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma
> sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma
> [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]

He is the literary living translator and implemented and carried out by single person. And that single person is so much infested and imbued with such a divine power. None of us can do. It is impossible. Practically it is impossible. The Prabhupāda's unfulfillment mission has been fulfilled by this Vedānta Prabhupāda. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata,// all quotes, quotations, praising this all types of the power, all propagating the //hari-nāma.// And it is all-powerful by him. So there is a medium of literature, medium of professor, medium of the cinema, but still, medium of the personality who in [indistinct] presented it himself. And you, all people, that attracted by his transcendental personality. What with these social religions; there are many authorities and leaders have gone there, and social-religious reformers who practice the //yoga, jñāna, karma,// etcetera, etcetera. But the one person imbued and empowered fully, transcendental form, by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself, and by his //guru,// Prabhupāda. I realized it. It is not that... Nobody can empower. And as a result our this Vaiṣṇava culture installing the Supreme as Kṛṣṇa pronounced as the //mantra// to worship Him. [Hindi] The //nāma...// If he fulfills the propagation of this out of the //nāma,// and then more powerful... Means that he is the more loved. This //kīrtana,// and more, this //saṅkīrtana.// These three things themselves teach us, though in one word---//kṛṣṇa-nāma-saṅkīrtana// is one faith. But still it has the three aspects---Kṛṣṇa, then //nāma,// then //kīrtana,// then //saṅkīrtana.// So he has, in his life, he exhibited, he translated, and in the world he has given this Kṛṣṇa. He has given this Kṛṣṇa. He has given the //nāma.// He has given the //kīrtana,// the //saṅkīrtana// which we have seen this morning, the //saṅkīrtana, bahubhir militvā.// Wonderful. In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta...//

**Prabhupāda:**
So you have got assets. You have got parentage. Everything you have got. Now do something. You have come. It is a good association. //Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvidaḥ// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]. [break] But they have dedicated their life to Kṛṣṇa. That is their qualification. //Bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa man...// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. So their association is //sādhu-saṅga .//

**Indian man (2):**
Real association place. [break]

**Viśvambhara:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [Hindi conversation as Prabhupāda takes //prasādam//]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is there any good cow's milk available?

**Viśvambhara:**
Oh, so much //brāhmaṇa// has brought so many cows.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has now kept some.

**Viśvambhara:**
Many cows we have got now. One Dhanañjaya bought, she is giving thirteen kilos, fourteen kilos.

**Indian man (3):**
Milk?

**Viśvambhara:**
Yes. I bought it from Govardhan, from Dhanañjaya. She is giving thirteen, fourteen kilos.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Viśvambhara:**
Transcendental standard, in each and every thing. [Hindi conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] Judgment, Supreme Court, America. [Hindi conversation] And what about that Hindi translation?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That judge is making?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That has to be sent. We don't have it yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] [break] "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." So restaurant is going on in Jalni[?] building? No.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Evening, up till ten o'clock.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In the new building? In this building.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's in the guesthouse. There weren't many people there, though. Only about five people at lunch.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Today.

**Prabhupāda:**
People are not coming.

**Akṣayānanda:**
It's up and down, Prabhupāda. Sometimes it's full. One day it's full; one day it's nothing. It's not steady. This is the problem. We always invite them. We go to the people personally and invite them, and they come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think the waiters could have been better. They're not very...

**Akṣayānanda:**
I can snap them up.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They should be a little more businesslike. [background discussion] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...see Rādhā-Dāmodara temple.

**Akṣayānanda:**
That would be nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Maybe tomorrow, if this Jayaśacīnandana goes the first time, I can go with him. I know Gauracānda a little bit, so I can, you know, just, as your secretary, send your greetings to him. He'll appreciate that.

**Akṣayānanda:**
He'll appreciate.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think what I'll do is I'll go at the time when I know they're supposed to be making that offering. That way, I'll see if it's being done. Little spy work. What time is that offering made? Noontime?

**Devotee:**
Yeah, noon.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Twelve? [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Then have them bring little //prasādam// from there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. From the plate that's offered to you?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, from... [break] [end]
