**Prabhupāda:**
...in that paper he wrote, "In case I die, these three men will be trustees, and the majority will be effective." So that scrap of paper, Tīrtha Mahārāja kept it. And later on, Guru Mahārāja wanted to make a constitution, but he avoided. But actually, after his demise that scrap of paper was presented in the high court, and property was given. That is the...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's... It was considered as a will.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hmm. No need of big, formal document.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is the original founder. Whatever he wills, that's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He recovered from that hernia operation.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] No, and later on, he did not undergo hern... He thought, then, don't do. After all, everyone has got sentiment. He thought it that "The doctor has been called to kill me." So he did not undergo the hernia operation.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He thought the doctor was paid off to kill him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
'Cause sometimes people //were// paid off to kill him.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he did not go.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, you and your Guru Mahārāja are the greatest enemies of modern civilization in this century, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So many people, materialists...

**Prabhupāda:**
This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission:

> bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This is India's culture. The whole world is in darkness, and they are risking their life in the transmigration of one body to another, //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-var...// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]. The rascals do not know what they are doing. They are simply taking account of few years. He does not know that he's eternal. A few years, a fragment, a pass..., passing way, that's all. A passing flash. And //bharam udvahato vimūḍhān.// This is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. This rascal... //Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān. Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa, māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. This is Vaiṣṇava's concern, that "These, what, rascals, they are doing?" That is Vaiṣṇavism. "What these rascals are doing, jumping like monkey, wasting time?" That is Vaiṣṇavism. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// These rascals do not know, driving motorcar, "//ghata-ghata-ghata-ghata-ghata-ghata-ghata.//" He's going to fall down in the sea, but rascal does not know. He's racing with a dog. Dog is also running with full speed, and he's showing, "Oh, I have got this car. This much proud I am."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Big dog.

**Prabhupāda:**
Big dog. And for that motorcar, so many tire tubes, so many parts, so many men engaged and money, policies and [indistinct] completion, "Come here and compare with other 1970-year car." Have you seen the advertisement?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
All these things, this is going on. Chevrolet Company adver... "Bring other 1977 model and see what we have done." [Hindi]

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So Prabhupāda has decided that the best medicine will be //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //kīrtana,// and no need of any doctors who've promised that "I will save your life" or anything like that. We shouldn't bring them. And no outsiders. No outsiders.

**Indian man (1):**
No medicine for the body?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No medicine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever medicine I am taking, that...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's taking a little bit. //Yogendra-rasa// he's taking. He's tried so many medicines. That is the point. Every doctor has come, and they've each given their medicine, and he's tried them. But they don't work. This medicine always works---//Bhāgavatam// and //kīrtana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhavauṣadhi.//

**Indian man (1):**
//Bhavauṣadhi. Bhava auṣadhi.// The cure for the bad of materialism.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt.// It pleases the ear and mind: "Oh, I am taking this nice..." //Bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt// [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]. What is that? //Ka uttama-śloka-guṇānuvādāt. Uttama-śloka,// Bhagavān, glorification of His activities. //Virajyeta vinā paśughnāt:// "Those who are //paśughna,// except them, who can avoid this medicine?"

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda will come, and he'll sit in front of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma every day for a couple of hours, and he's calling some of his..., all the devotees here. They'll be with him. Like that. No... Perfect medicine.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he's calling all the GBC, all the GBC.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All the GBC men, we're calling them.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there is no hurry. Go on with your respective duty. That's all. [hums] All right. Now you can...

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] [end]
