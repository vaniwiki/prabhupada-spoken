**Ātreya Ṛṣi:**
Both. It's also curing us, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt// [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]. You'll find..., not find any medicine throughout the universe that you'll be benefited either you die or be... This is the only medicine. In both ways you are... The death is inevitable, you die today or tomorrow. So by taking this medicine, if you die, you have the greatest benefit. And if you live, enjoy. If you die, enjoy; if you live, enjoy. Go on chanting. [//kīrtana//] [break] No, I have no objection. [laughter] I am prepared in either way. What is that machine they keep? Husking machine?

**Upendra:**
Asking machine?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Husking machine.

**Prabhupāda:**
That from paddy, rice is taken away by beating.

**Bhavānanda:**
[whispering] That's the [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
In your country there is no such thing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Māyāpur we have seen.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is called //ḍheṅki.//

**Bhavānanda:**
//Ḍheṅki.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Indian. [Bengali] //Ḍheṅki?// [Bengali]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayapatākā must know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Jayapatākā must know.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[aside:] What is that husking machine?

**Bhavānanda:**
//Ḍheṅki?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhavānanda:**
//Ḍheṅki.//

**Jayapatākā:**
//Ḍheṅki.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So the //ḍheṅki...// If you send the //ḍheṅki// to heaven, so what it will do? Same business. Either the //ḍheṅki// is kept here or in the heaven, his business to do that "//Dag, dag, dag, dag...//" So?

**Jayapatākā:**
Next group is there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says the next group is ready.

**Jayapatākā:**
Can I give the report, Tamāla?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] Yes? Next person? [break] [Bengali] By passing wind if there is somebody will benefit, they'll not pass. Such a low-grade man. Therefore they are ruined, those men. There is not a single upright. You cannot expect that they will willfully, willingly...

**Jayapatākā:**
No, we'll get that by hook or by crook.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is only... //Sathe sārthaṁ samācaret.//[?] They are first-class cheater. We shall cheat them. [laughter] Don't worry. This is only... They have ruined the institution, all third-class, fourth-class men.

**Jayapatākā:**
He knew that it was right. He couldn't deny it. But he has got no power to... No willpower.

**Prabhupāda:**
No power? No, he has power. He'll not do. He has power.

**Jayapatākā:**
Yeah, that's what I mean. He has got no personal character to do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. He has power.

**Jayapatākā:**
He wrote it, "No one can say otherwise."

**Prabhupāda:**
No... That is only way. Just take it. Let it happen only. Then we shall see. But he'll not do that because they are very, very cripple-minded, mean-minded, and by hook and crook they have... And what they have done? For the last fifty years they are working in Caitanya Maṭha. There is not even a //nātha-mandira.//

**Jayapatākā:**
The other temples they have not even maintained. Only Caitanya Maṭha somehow or another they are maintaining, but the other branches are falling apart.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The same condition as it was. They have no life. Dead body. Now it will deteriorate more and more. Tīrtha Mahārāja, envious, managing. And they will not give. So tit for tat. You can do that. Then that is very glorious. That is a different country, different law. Some way or other, if you get the sympathizer, then take it.

**Jayapatākā:**
The local committee, they want to give. They're coming June 4th to see him. I said, "There's no use to see him. He'll never agreee."

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Jayapatākā:**
They said, "But we feel, etiquette, we should give him the chance. We'll tell him that 'You've not done anything forty years. You're not going to do anything. Why don't give it to Śrīla Prabhupāda of ISKCON? Let them develop,' 'cause we need the preaching. And if he denies, then we'll come back to Dacca, pass resolution and give it to ISKCON."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. That is... That will be glorious. They are very mean-minded. All mean-minded class, they have assembled together. That's all.

**Jayapatākā:**
You are like the sun, Śrīla Prabhupāda. In front of you the darkness cannot remain. Everything is visible as it is. Your words remove all doubt.

**Prabhupāda:**
Even... He's... Even a simple Vaiṣṇava, he also advocated, "Why you are keeping?"

**Jayapatākā:**
Yeah. Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Although he's considered their man, but his business is Vaiṣṇava. He told the real truth. That is Vaiṣṇava. "Why you are holding? You cannot do anything."

**Jayapatākā:**
Even they give it, they're not giving anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Jayapatākā:**
'Cause they can't hold anyway. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the...

**Jayapatākā:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatākā:**
You told me.

**Prabhupāda:**
And these //ācārya// and president, they are less than paid servant. They are afraid of.

**Jayapatākā:**
Yeah, Tīrtha's brother and son...

**Prabhupāda:**
That "Some way or other, we're keeping some position." And if Samvit kicked him out, then where is his position? That is another problem. This Rādhā-Govinda Mahārāja, what he can do if he's driven away? In this age he cannot have his own institution. And in this age where he'll go? They are... "These politicians, these old men, they cannot do now. So give them some false position, that 'You are president, //ācārya.//' They will not rebel at least." And as soon as they do something against them, "We shall drive away: 'No, you cannot be president. Another president.' " That's all. They had no love for him, neither he has any love for them. It is simply official. This Samvit dāsa one, Samvit, also not very intelligent. Tīrtha Mahārāja's son, he wants to keep the property in his name and utilize it for his personal... That way. Preaching and preaching and..., they don't care for. And you said that there is some..., still some strength amongst themselves.

**Jayapatākā:**
Yes, there's some, yeah. Some amongst them are trying to get the Govinda and other, to be strong, to withstand them, but I don't think they have that strength.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Jayapatākā:**
There's some undercurrent is there.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he can, but he has no such plan. If he imposes his power as president, he can do that. But he's afraid. He cannot make any disciples. That is...

**Jayapatākā:**
Saman Mahārāja. As //ācārya,// I think he makes disciple. He cannot make any administrative. Administrative is Govinda Mahārāja. Something like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means both of them are being conducted by higher authority. Anyway, if the local men, they pass resolution like that, that is very good.

**Jayapatākā:**
They're thoroughly disgusted. They can see all of these things. When I told them of [indistinct] things... They're very determined.

**Prabhupāda:**
If they... And if they call, we shall immediately...

**Jayapatākā:**
The situation there is precarious. There are vast majority of Muhammadans. Constantly the Hindus are being..., not have any chance to worship or to have any strength or spiritual life.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no philosophy, no science, nothing at the temple. A small Deity. Small.

**Jayapatākā:**
Smallest. Even that, there's not regular //bhoga// or //prasāda// distribution, nothing. The people there, they came and asked me that "Why you don't establish, do some //saṁskāra?// You establish your //mandira// here." I said, "You tell the man here to give to us. Immediately I am putting one //chada[?]// on this //nātha-mandira// and distributing //prasāda// weekly, five hundred people." They surrounded, that man said, and practically everything less than physically grabbed him. They were yelling at him, "Why you are not giving?" Says, "If you don't do, then we'll make our own committee and give."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Do that. They are simply... They can do.

**Jayapatākā:**
And everyone appreciates your work, Śrīla Prabhupāda. What you've done for Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava, no one has done.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, that same group of GBC that met with you yesterday...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhavānanda:**
The GBC men that met with you yesterday, they'd like to see you again. They have one more resolution.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. [break]

**Jayatīrtha:**
You're feeling a little stronger today, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Something.

**Prabhupāda:**
Little improvement there is.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Good medicine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, I am very much confident of this medicine, because nobody is prepared to die, but I am prepared to die. That much strength I have got. Generally people do not like to die. But I will be very glad to die if Kṛṣṇa wants. This is... And I shall stay with you. I have no objection either way. But I am not afraid of death. That much strength I have got. Why shall I be afraid? There is no cause of... [devotees enter and offer obeisances]

**Jayatīrtha:**
//Jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Bhakta-sane bās.// Such a great opportunity. You are all pure devotees. To live with you and to die while you are chanting, such a great fortune. So there is no question of being afraid of death. [break] Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Of course, we have our preference.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have no objection. I have no... [break] Whatever His desire is, I... [break] [end]
