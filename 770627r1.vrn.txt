**Prabhupāda:**
And they are all intelligent in sense gratification. Quite equal in intelligence, like the man. There is no scarcity of intelligence. //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya// [//Hitopadeśa//]. How to sleep, how to eat, how to enjoy sex, how to protect from danger---they know everything completely. [break] ...he's trained up. And how to enjoy according to the body, place, that complete intelligence is there. Lord Brahmā has got that intelligence, and the small insect, he has got. And Kṛṣṇa is giving everyone facility: "All right, enjoy." //Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. //Sarva-bhūtāni.// Everyone is getting opportunity. According to his //karma,// he's getting a suitable body. You want to become Brahmā? All right. And you become..., want to become a hog? All right. If you want to become worm in the stool, all right. This is going on. And devotion begins when one does not want to become anything. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. Then he likes. So when you desire, either you desire like a Brahmā or the worm in the stool, that is material. And when you give up this desire, then spiritual life begins. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. So to become //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam,// that is required. Who will understand this philosophy?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now with your books, the whole world may understand.

**Prabhupāda:**
Of course, we have made such attempt.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
People write that now they have got your books they are feeling actually alive for the first time. People write like that. They get so many letters, the BBT, thanking them for giving these books. In all languages people are writing you like that. They feel grateful.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I received directly such congratulations in the airport many times. Many times.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
People would come up to you.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think in Japan I have got. One European boy came. He came: "How you have got so much knowledge, sir?" [laughs] His inquiry was that. In Dum Dum Airport some gentleman came, Indian. The thing is, knowledge is there. It was not presented. [pause] [aside:] He'll take one; you take one. [break] Hmm? Kṛṣṇa asked the //gopīs// that "You can take your cloth, one after another. You have done a great fault. Naked, you are taking your bath. So just offer to the deity //namaskāra.//" [laughs] Chastised: "You are very naughty. Why you are doing like this? I tell you, this is for your good." So they did it. [pause] Gopījana-vallabha. [pause] Kṛṣṇa's naughty activities... In every neighboring house they would come, Mother Yaśodā, friends, and they'll repeat Kṛṣṇa's naughty activities, and Mother Yaśodā, stopping all household business, she would hear. She would hear again. This is //kṛṣṇa-līlā.// How ordinary person will understand? "What is this? Spiritual life? A child's naughty activities, and they are hearing, and this is spiritual?" But Kṛṣṇa has made easy salvation, that simply by hearing His naughty activities you'll be liberated. Who will understand this philosophy? [aside:] Can you give me a little hot water with lemon?

**Devotee (1):**
Hot drinking water?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hot water and lemon.

**Prabhupāda:**
No lemon. Lime. Lime.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Hot water and lime. Not lemon, lime. That acts like digestive. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...ask the list.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That list is being... Of your book distribution? Is that the list? He asked yesterday of a list of books distributed, the list I read.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, one list, for whom we want permanent residence. List of.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Er, that Gopāla has to compile.

**Prabhupāda:**
He'll never compile. He does not know.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's going to do that for sure. He thought that you didn't want him to compile it, because day before yesterday you had mentioned to Gopāla, "For now don't give list. Simply say we have fifty persons." But Gopāla wants to give a list.

**Prabhupāda:**
And they want it. Vajpayee wanted.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right, they want a list.

**Prabhupāda:**
Surendra Kumar told me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So Gopāla, he's definitely going to do it. I mean, he told me he's doing that, that that's part of the application. He told me the different items. He will get their //karmī// names, spiritual names, passport number. He's aware of having to do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
In America there are many thousands of Indians, permanent resident.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The thing is that at this point in America there is such a thing as permanent residency. It's a law. I mean there's a... But in India there's no such thing existing at this time.

**Prabhupāda:**
That I know, but...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They have to create this. That is the difficulty. They have to...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that means incompetent government.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Incompetent government. America knows, "If there is a useful man, why should we not give?" I know in Montreal there was a black man... What is called? Consulate?

**Devotee (1):**
We have no limes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Where's Bhakti-caru?

**Devotee (1):**
[indistinct] go-down. We have lemons but no limes. Are lemons all right?

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that lemon?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Lemon means like a light yellow, lemon.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes, lemon.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Nimbu.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Ameri... The difference between a lemon and a lime is the lime is green-colored. Lemon is yellow-colored. But I think they act the same way.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Lime has a special flavor.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, it does have a special flavor. It's a nice flavor. In drinks people put lime.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Bengal a first eating hot rice with little ghee, salt and this lime flavor, it becomes so palatable, with smashed potato.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Smashed...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Potato. With little chili. Oh, you can eat half the quantity of rice immediately.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sounds very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
They do that, especially in villages. [pause] [break] If I would have possessed the lands, money, I would have developed.

**Devotee (1):**
Did you want honey with it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Who told you?

**Devotee (1):**
Well, I didn't put it in yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. What is that?

**Devotee (1):**
This is a //nimbu.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hot water?

**Devotee (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is... [drinks] [pause] [break] ...advertised here. Why thousands of Americans come here and did not inquire about Vivekananda?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Vivekananda.

**Prabhupāda:**
They never inquire. Do they? Eh?

**Devotee (1):**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then what kind of preaching he has done? Nobody knows him. This common sense they haven't got. And here it is advertised, "Vivekananda has converted whole America into Vedāntist." [laughs] And they take money for that. [pause] Pradyumna may see me ten minutes a day. That will be simplified. He comes after week.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. I talked to him. I asked him, "Why don't you discuss your questions with Bhakti-prema Swami first? And then, if he cannot answer anything, then go ask Śrīla Prabhupāda."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. He may come during my massage time, daily ten minutes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, because that hour in a row is too much, whenever he waits and waits. [pause] [end]
