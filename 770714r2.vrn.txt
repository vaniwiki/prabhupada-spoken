**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
...ground floor restaurant. So it would take eighteen months to build the building. And then the idea is that we can have the ground floor for our restaurant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. Make Govinda Restaurant.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
New Delhi will like it. New Delhi people will appreciate a vegetarian restaurant. So I think there's some pleasing news, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This is from..., sent by Baradrāj Prabhu. It's a letter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Delhi temple is going on nice?

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
Oh, yes. We are redecorating everything inside. We've painted to about four feet off the ground with some gloss paint and then nice distemper. And I've spent, oh, a lot of money, around two thousand rupees on the whole temple. Temple room, Deity room, kitchens, everything. We're painting it all. And now Bhakti-caitanya Swami, he will have his office there. BBT office will be in Delhi. It is very good arrangement.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Maybe I should show you the pictures first. I've brought your glasses. These are the photographs, Śrīla Prabhupāda, of the Deities to be installed in Fiji. He's sending to you for your approval. First, this is Śrī-Śrī-Guru-Gaurāṅga in day dress.

**Prabhupāda:**
First class. Just like life.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Phew. Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very, very nice. They're superexcellent. Not only excellent but superexcellent.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here is a picture of the same Guru-Gaurāṅga in night dress.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can say, "It is superexcellent."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I have written it three times. [laughter] Here is your Guru Mahārāja. He looks like a young man, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [chuckles] Very young. Here he is with full dress and garlanded. Here is Your Divine Grace, //mūrti,// fully dressed and garlanded.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything superexcellent.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here is the Deity of Lord Nityānanda dressed and undressed, so you can see. They've done very nicely with the two photographs. You can get the full idea. I think the proportions are first class. Just accurate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gaurāṅga.

**Upendra:**
What are they made of?

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Fiji.

**Upendra:**
Plasticene?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here comes the //nāgapatnīs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Fishlike.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not dressed?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They will be. That's just showing you the //mūrti.// Here is Kṛṣṇa-Kāliya. Here is a full picture, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, it will attract so many people.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Lalitā, Viśākhā. Those are just, I think, temporary dresses to give an idea. Day dresses. Here is the Deity of Kṛṣṇa without clothing so you can see. Phew. Look at this material. It's lovely.

**Prabhupāda:**
Indian art and American artist. I want this combination. It is coming. Gradually develop.

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
The result is good each time. It is...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is Lalitā-Viśākhā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gradually they are becoming very expert.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should I read Baradrāj's letter, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Um-hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Dear Śrīla Prabhupāda: I fall down in the dust of your lotus feet, in desperate hope of being purified of countless offenses."

**Prabhupāda:**
So "You have done superexcellent //mūrtis.// Thank you very much."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should I go on reading? "I am lowborn and completely disqualified from the exalted position of your servant, yet I cannot give up the desire for it. Please be merciful to me."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. That you are feeling like that, humbleness, that is Kṛṣṇa's mercy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "I have received your merciful letter, dated April 8th, in which you have instructed me to fashion //Pañca-tattva vigraha// for the Hawaii //yātrā.// You also revealed your desire to see photographs of the completed set of //mūrtis// for the Kṛṣṇa-Kāliya Mandir in Fiji. In regards to the Hawaii Deities, we have just now been able to begin the work, and it would be completed some time in the end of August. We have already received remuneration for fifty percent of the cost from Śrutakīrti dāsa. As far as the Kṛṣṇa-Kāliya temple //vigrahas,// I beg to inform you that they have been shipped two weeks ago, along with two sets of dresses, one for the day and one for the night, for all of them. Enclosed please find a complete set of photographs of the Fiji //mūrtis.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
They're all superexcellent.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"I hope that they meet with your approval. We are now in the process of completing a reproduction of the //saṁsāra// display for the twofold purpose of museum publicity, a special photograph to be taken by a famous photographer..." It's funny. You told him not to do this, but they went ahead and did it. "...and an exhibit to be displayed at the Los Angeles First Annual Ratha-yātrā festival grounds. This //saṁsāra// diorama has an outstanding response from the general public, and we hope to make it available to many centers for the preaching work in the near future. In connection with this I had an idea of constructing traveling trailers housing one such exhibit, complete with lights and sound, explaining the process..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, it will be very nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says he wants to make a trailer. Trailer means like a big...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"...and sound, explaining the process of transmigration of the soul and other philosophical displays from the //Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
It will be so attractive.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "These trailers could be used to distribute Your Divine Grace's books in many new, inaccessible places. I would like to know if this meets with your kind approval."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"We have a model of //saṁsāra// on display in our shop window, and all day long we are getting dozens of curious passerbys from the street who inquire submissively and listen attentively to the philosophy. I remember Your Divine Grace telling me emphatically..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Try to sell them //Bhagavad-gītā,// which explains.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "I remember in Bombay in 1974 that this would make our preaching successful all over the world."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Now I am practically..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Without reading books they'll understand the philosophy. That is the advantage. Mass of people, without education, they will understand the philosophy.

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
It's like the circus. Simple.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "I have sent out an advertisement to all centers to encourage them to order Guru and Gaurāṅga Deities from us. We can deliver these to them in very short time and at a lower cost than the Jaipur craftsmen."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"I hope that this meets with your approval."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Very good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They're not made of marble.

**Prabhupāda:**
But as good as marble. They... Are they?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't know. I hope so.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are being made from marble powder?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. They're very strong. It says, "We have maintained, through your never-ending kindness, for two years or more financially in terms of our daily operational requirements and household support. Now I'm looking for ways of relieving Bhaktivedanta Book Trust of the burden at once. Deity making, the //saṁsāra// trailer, and other such enterprises will provide means for our maintenance and research expenditures..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, very good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"...which in this project will inevitably increase constantly as we take on more and more ambitious undertakings."

**Prabhupāda:**
From //Bhāgavatam// you can make hundreds and thousands of doll exhibits. Each stanza of //Bhāgavata// will give you ideas of dolls. The //karmīs// can be exhibited... //Dharmasya hy āpavargyasya// [[books:sb:1:2:9|[SB 1.2.9]]]. This //śloka// can be explained, what is the meaning of religion, by doll exhibition. When you do it I shall give you ideas how to...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "By your mercy, now there is a very concentrated effort on behalf of Rāmeśvara Swami, Ambarīṣa dāsa and myself to plan and build an impressive theistic exhibition in Washington, D.C...."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"...which would attract the attention of some of the world's greatest leaders and dignitaries. The scope and implications of this task are breathtaking, and I am feeling very small and insignificant in confrontation with it, just like a dwarf trying to touch the moon. However, if you want me to perform this task, then kindly give me your mercy and bless me..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You train up assistants and this will be recognized by government and everyone. You'll do more than Columbus. [laughter] In the Washington, in different compartments, a different explanation of //Bhāgavata śloka// by dolls will attract millions of people to see. Will it not?

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
Oh! It will become more than Disneyland.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. And you can charge some fees, entrance fee. People will gladly pay. All around, this doll exhibition, and in the medium, a planetarium, small.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Small?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. If they're going to have it in Māyāpur, they can have a little... Not very small. Proportionate.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. He says, "The FATE..."---they call it FATE, First American Theistic Exhibition---"The FATE Los Angeles exhibit is now complete, with very small details remaining on the complex computer system. It will be operational on July 10th." Four days ago. "And the grand opening will be held on Janmāṣṭamī this year. I have no right to hope in this way, but in spite of my intelligence, I wish Your Divine Grace could see this first attempt for theistic exhibition in the Western world."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says if it's not possible for you to come, then he'd like to make a film and bring it to India to show it to you. Is that all right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"One point," he says... "One point I would like to clear up in connection with our distribution of //mūrtis.// I have had many requests and inquiries about placing the form of Your Divine Grace on the //vyāsāsana// along with or instead of on the altar for worship. Is this permissible? In some temples the altar is too small and will not accommodate the present size of the..."

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Vyāsāsana// is good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So either one is all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. If there is picture in the middle and //vyāsāsana.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So these //mūrtis// can be placed on the //vyāsāsana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, what about Guru-Gaurāṅga? Just like in Kṛṣṇa-Kāliya temple they're going to have it on the altar.

**Prabhupāda:**
So one place will be good, the same.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So if there's enough room on the altar it can be there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Otherwise on the //vyāsāsana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Another point is the subject matter of my conversation with you last year." He says, "You explained at that time that resin, rosin, is a by-product of crude oil, which is a transformation of earth. Since earth is one of the materials used for fashioning of //mūrtis,// this plastic is also suitable for the purpose. Am I understanding this correctly?" Yes, it's correct. He says, "Rosin is a by-product of crude oil, which is a transformation of earth, and earth is one of the bona fide substances."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Some of the temple presidents are contesting the purity of the substance and are hesitant to order Deities on this account. On the other..."

**Prabhupāda:**
No. You can do whichever is very sound and strong.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is very sound and strong.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. Original ingredient is //bhūmi,// earth.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So there's no reason... It's pure. It's not a question that it's not pure.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.1].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Another thing he says... The last point is that he saw... You know in New York they made those busts to be put in libraries, of Your Divine Grace? Some sculptures. Remember I showed you some photographs of...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says he understood that busts of divine images of //guru// and Kṛṣṇa are not to be made. He says in New York you explained this point with reference to photographs that were used in //Back to Godhead// of your divine self that it was impersonal to cut off some portion of the complete worshipable form.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, if it is not worshipable, if it is to be kept in library, that can be done.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. He says, "I beg to be excused for troubling Your Divine Grace on all these questions, which I always hesitate to do, but I took this liberty."

**Prabhupāda:**
You are always allowed. //Sad-dharma-pṛcchā// [[books:cc:madhya:22:115|[Cc. Madhya 22.115]]]. This is one of the duties of devotees. //Sad-dharma-pṛcchā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says that they're going to try... As long as they can make busts, he says, "We would like to make them larger than life size, in the monumental style, which would include your lotus feet." Full size for museums and other places. Big size. Anywhere where people want to display. But it won't be worshiped. It will be on display. So that's one letter. If you're feeling tired I can read more later on.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that's all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I haven't seen what this is yet. It's from Gargamuni Mahārāja. It's "To all India GBC and temple presidents: Dear Mahārājas and Prabhus, please accept my humble obeisances. Enclosed please find our newly established Encyclopedia of Vedic Knowledge program. This is the beginning of the major big book distribution program in India. Our library party has already received tremendous success in this program, and Śrīla Prabhupāda has greatly encouraged us to sell these all over India. The profit only amounts to Rs. 10 per book, but it will allow everyone to regularly read our books and refer to it as an authentic encyclopedia. Our aim is to replace this encyclopedia against all other encyclopedias, which are meant to take the people to the hellish planets. When our representatives come to your area, please be good enough to assist them in making possible that Śrīla Prabhupāda's books be distributed to leading educational, intellectual persons all over India." Here's what he's published, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's called "The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Library Encyclopedia of Vedic Knowledge." I think I should read it to you, because it's got mostly words in it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Read the covering.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's pretty much the whole thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Pamphlet.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, it's a pamphlet. Should I read it to you? It says, "Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Encyclopedia Department, Hare Kṛṣṇa Land, Juhu Road, Juhu, Bombay. In 1970 His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda founded the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust for worldwide printing and publishing of Vedic knowledge. Today the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust publishes in twenty-five languages with a total of 55,000,000 publications printed in six years." Phew! Fifty-five million! That means an average of nearly ten million a year, pieces of literature. No other publishing house can boast that, I don't think, such a big amount. "The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust offices are located in Los Angeles, New York, London, Paris, Frankfurt and Bombay. Śrīla Prabhupāda has..."

**Prabhupāda:**
You can send one copy to Dr. Kapoor by post.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'll tell Gargamuni. It will be more impressive coming from Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And one to Bon Mahārāja at Vaṁśī-vaṭa[?].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[laughs] Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. "Śrīla Prabhupāda has taken on the monumental task of translating the essence of all Vedic..." I want to get to the... Here it comes. "All in all, the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Library Encyclopedia of Vedic Knowledge includes at least one hundred published volumes. Scholars from all over the world have described Śrīla Prabhupāda as a literary genius after reading his treasure chest of Vedic knowledge. And now for the first time this treasure chest of transcendental knowledge is unlocked for everyone to dive deep into the ocean of transcendental bliss upon reading these classics." These words are nectar.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"It is no wonder that this transcendental treasure chest of spiritual texts have been described by many scholars as the first presentation of full encyclopedia of Vedic knowledge. This encyclopedia touches various subject matters relating to philosophy, religion, sociology and anthropology, literature and classics, political science and history and psychology. On the back side of this pamphlet an order blank to apply for a full encyclopedia published by the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust is given. Please fill in and return." [chuckles] Here's what he says, "The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Library of Vedic Knowledge can make a worthwhile gift to a friend or relative or may be kept in one's own home. Or one may contribute a set to a school, college, hospital library, reading room, temple, or for any other charitable purpose. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust is offering this encyclopedia on an easy installment basis by which one may receive published volumes every month without any extra cost." Sounds like they're getting a lot for free. [chuckles]

**Prabhupāda:**
Organized very nice. Hmm. "Gargamoney." [laughter]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Kindly fill in the form below to receive your first volumes." Then it says, "Name and age, date of purchase, address, city, state, country, type of business, phone, number of sets to be purchased." Number of sets to be purchased. It's very hopeful. "Whether encyclopedia is for personal use or other, please explain." 'Cause they're going to keep a file to see what people use it for. "Number of books to be received each year. Amount given as advance." He says, "At least fifty percent of the total cost can be given for the complete set as advance, and balance to be made in yearly installments. Signature of purchaser. Please note: The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust shall fulfill its obligation to supply all books to the purchaser as agreed upon and shall ship all books postage prepaid to any part of the world. Dated and signature of the salesman. Checks to be made out in the name of Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Bombay. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust Library Encyclopedia of Vedic Knowledge, Founder-//Ācārya// His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. Recommendations and appreciations by leading scholars of India on the BBT Library Encyclopedia of Vedic knowledge." He seems to have got a lot... I don't know how he did this. It says... These are different recommendations. It's from the Minister of Education, Government of Maharastra. Shrimati Patiba Patel. " 'I therefore wholeheartedly recommend this encyclopedia of our culture and all BBT publications to all educational institutions, schools, libraries and colleges concerned with the moral and cultural development of their students within the boundary of Maharastra and throughout the world.' " See, each one he has the word //encyclopedia// bold and underlined. "Ph.D. from Harvard University." All different big personalities. "The Mayor of Bombay. Padma Bhushan, Vice-Chancellor of Baroda University. Professor of Gujarati language, Gold Medal winner and author of 36 Gujarati books." Another man. "Award-winning Gold-medalist in Gujarati literature." "Award-winning author in Sindhi literature." All these people are giving their recommendations. "Award-winning author in Sindhi literature." "Head of the Department of Sanskrit at Bombay University." "Head of the Department of Sindhi in RC College, Bombay." Then he has a review by P. M. Joshi. "Dr. P. M. Joshi, past director of Archives and Historical Monuments, Maharastra government; past professor in charge of History, Bombay and Poona University." So many different titles. Then he has one from Prabhudas P. Patwaria, governor of Tamil Nadu. And another one from the Deputy Director, Research, of the Lok Sabha. Would you like to see some more things, Śrīla Prabhupāda? The next one looks... This next one is also from Gargamuni. It includes a letter, Śrīla Prabhupāda. "My dear Śrīla Prabhupāda, please accept my humble obeisances at your divine lotus feet. We fervently pray that Your Divine Grace continue to remain in this world because we need your personal guidance. Even when Lord Kṛṣṇa disappeared, Arjuna lost all strength temporarily."

**Prabhupāda:**
I shall remain your personal guidance, physically present or not physically, as I am getting personal guidance from my Guru Mahārāja.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "Arjuna was a great, powerful devotee, and he could overcome the shock. But we are most fallen and cannot endure such a shock of having you leave us. We are already mortified by such a thought. Your movement is just now being accepted, and we want you to remain to lead all your devotees towards successful spiritual life. Despite our offenses, all of us deeply have great love for Your Divine Grace, and our world will become dark without your presence. Materially you have provided all of your devotees with everything: big temples, money, prestige and honor, nice //prasādam.//" [chuckles] That's not material. "But I would relish more being with you without all of these things as we..." He says, "But personally I would relish more being with you without all of these things, as we began at 26 Second Avenue. Simply hearing you chant and talk for hours is my only solace. I don't want anything else. We left all these material things to be with you only, so please have mercy with your devotees by allowing us to have your personal appearance as long as..."

**Prabhupāda:**
He was from very beginning. Brahmānanda. He has worked very hard from the beginning.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "I may also come to cook and clean for you..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you are welcome.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"...if you so desire. And carry you also."

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] No, you are doing more important business. Do that. But if you want to do, whatever you like, you can come. He is a good cook also.

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
Hmm. Everyone compliments his cooking. Everyone.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "We have a great debt to repay you, and we are perplexed how to repay. At least Your Divine Grace may stay as long as we try to repay till the debt we owe to you." He says, "I think if we work hard and preach and the world recognizes this movement, then you may want to stay here longer."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's a fact.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"I am constantly filling this into the minds of the members of the Library Party. We are now emphasizing your books as a library of Encyclopedia of Vedic Knowledge, and I am herewith enclosing reviews from the biggest Marathi, Gujarati and Sindhi scholars."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, it is very nice. He has done quite efficiently.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, there's another thing. This whole thing, these are new reviews I'm going to read to you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"I also have other good news." He says, "The Andhra Pradesh government has sent a newsletter to all libraries in the state, requesting them to order our books, as they are approved by the state." Wow!

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can do it from other provinces also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Also, the Endowments Commission has also written to all the temples in Andhra Pradesh requesting them to purchase our books." Very important.

**Prabhupāda:**
The Endowment Minister is very favorable to us.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"In addition, the Gujarati government has requested all libraries in the state to purchase our books by way of newsletter."

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Wonderful.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Here in Maharastra the new Chief Minister and Education Minister have approved of our movement, and on the basis of these letters I sent our devotee to five district towns, on the basis of these letters." On the strength of the letters from the Chief Minister and Education Minister, he sent his devotees to five district towns, and they secured thirty-two standing orders in three weeks.

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
From five towns!

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Now we are going to all the district towns." That means not very big cities. "Now we are going to all the district towns in Maharastra, and almost one thousand standing orders have been taken all over India so far. Since we have started the encyclopedia program many persons have ordered every single book you have published. Nearly twenty encyclopedia orders have been taken so far." This means every book. Not just one standing order. Complete.

**Prabhupāda:**
May Kṛṣṇa bless him. You are doing very tremendous job.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Says, "First week, July, three of our men are opening a BBT Library office in Bangkok."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"They have a mission to develop this whole area, Southeast Asia, for book distribution." He sent a team of three men to develop Southeast Asia, and they've opened an office in Bangkok. "Their program includes: 1] government recognition of our books, 2] sales to universities and colleges, 3] acceptance of our books by leading scholars, and 4] sales of encyclopedias to Hindus. All of Southeast Asia will be developed for book distribution. We pray for your blessing in this..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Kṛṣṇa's blessings are there upon you. He is dictating the organizing capacity. Do it very nicely.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "Pālikā, being the manager, is very active and happy and busily engaged in keeping all the files properly."

**Prabhupāda:**
Now she has got right appointment. She's very intelligent girl. And give her proper assistance. She can do very nice work.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "So far, I have credits of over three //lakhs// of rupees with BBT in our first year of distribution." He's given over three //lakhs// business.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now print books and have enough stock.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. That's what he wants. He complains that there isn't.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Then you have to manage that department also. How... There must be sufficient stock, not depend on one press. That Mr. Myer's... What is the address? Do you know?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No. He wants to bring us samples from...

**Prabhupāda:**
Very soon I shall send you good address of printing //Bhāgavata// in Bombay. So at least three, four printing printers should go on, continuously printing our books. If you have money, you spend it for reprinting books.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says that he has three //lakhs'// rupees credit so far, and "our accounts receivable still amount to two //lakhs.//" So five //lakhs// in one year.

**Prabhupāda:**
So invest. Invest in printing books.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "No school has defaulted in their payments." None of them. "I am also enclosing a complete list of our standing orders in India. We pray for your guidance and blessings in our march towards successful spiritual life."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. All success to your forward march.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Do you want to hear some of the reviews, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm-hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You're not feeling tired at all now.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think this is invigorating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

"Important Muslim reviews." He's labeled their... This is from N. H. Hashni, Head Professor and Head of the Department of Urdu at Lucknow University. " 'Though I have little knowledge of Sanskrit, but as a student of literature I have been impressed by the meticulous care and clarity with which each //mantra// of the...' " [break] " '...my mother tongue Urdu. It could not only universalize the teachings of the //Vedāntas// but also it could very much help in bringing about the much needed integration of the multilingual humanity.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That's a fact. We are trying for that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here's another one from the Head of the Department of Philosophy and Social Sciences in Madras. His name is Usair Mohammed Kasim. " 'Swami Prabhupāda's //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// is a remarkable exposition of //Vedānta// philosophy. What impressed me most is its nonsectarian analysis and acceptability.' " He says its nonsectarian. Everyone would say it's a very... Most Hindus would say, "The //Bhagavad-gītā// is our book." But here is a Muslim saying it's nonsectarian. " 'Furthermore, this book I'm sure will inspire men of all faiths. The rendering is authentic and lucid. I am confident that this admirable classic will contribute to a greater understanding of Indian philosophical heritage.' " This book should be shown to these government men in Delhi, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This review. Usair Mohammed Kasim.

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
We can make copies?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. Write Gargamuni. He'll send more. This is an important Encyclopedia of Vedic Knowledge reviews. Actually he got all of these reviews recently. That's amazing. It's amazing how many reviews they got. These are all from the months of May and June I think. Yeah. You want to hear some of them? "Minister of Education: 'Message: The ancient roots of traditional Indian life reach farther into the distant past than any other country on earth. What thousands of years ago culminated in education included the development in the student of all good qualities. In other words, the pupil was ignited with a desire to learn and develop himself rather than strive for material rewards. From out of the great ages the ancients, headed by Śrī Vyāsadeva, have left us the timeless treatise of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the basis of all education.' " This is the Minister of Education, the Government of Maharastra. She's admitting...

**Prabhupāda:**
Vedavyāsa.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...Vyāsadeva is the basis of all education. " 'Later the saint Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja, in commenting upon the life of the great Mahāprabhu Śrī Caitanya, brought to the highest level of understanding these principles in his immortal Indian classic, //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// It is good fortune of the world that these two spiritual works presented as the Encyclopedia of Indian Culture have been translated and commented upon in the style of a true scholar by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. Śrīla Prabhupāda, out of his obviously great desire to inject the world with his vast storehouse of learning, has translated precisely the rich Sanskrit and Bengali //ślokas.// He has given the transliteration, word-for-word meaning, purports, and each volume filled with full color illustrations by his disciples. I therefore wholeheartedly recommend this encyclopedia of our culture and all other Bhaktivedanta Book Trust publications to all educational institutions, schools, libraries, and colleges concerned with the moral and cultural development of their students within the boundary of Maharastra and throughout the world.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here's one from the Mayor of Bombay, Murali S. Deora. He's the new mayor. " 'The good work of the members of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is well known to me. It is especially commendable that the founder-//ācārya// of the society, His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, has been able to convince so many foreigners all about the simple purity of India's exalted philosophy---plain living and high thinking. Swāmījī is a very highly respected Vedic scholar, and he has seen to it that his numerous disciples from all over India and the world stick to the actual disciplines required of students of our ancient philosophy. The growing cultural and educational center now under construction at Juhu...' " He refers to it as the growing cultural and educational center. He's understood your purpose, Śrīla Prabhupāda. " '...is an object of deep interest and pride to myself and all fellow Bombay citizens. The members of Kṛṣṇa consciousness are always well mannered and cheerful due to the blessings of their benign Swāmījī. Anyone who reads Śrīla Prabhupāda's clear translations and commentaries of well-known Sanskrit and Bengali literature can understand his secret of success. I do not think such accurate scholarly and clear expositions of Vedic culture can be found in English elsewhere. His Bhaktivedanta Book Trust publishing house has made sure that the immortal words of our classics have been presented in first-class style. Among the BBT publications, the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// comprising an encyclopedia of Vedic knowledge, are especially notable. I have examined volumes of these sets and recommend these sets not only for our municipal corporation libraries and municipal-funded libraries, but for all libraries of the world, wherever...' "

**Prabhupāda:**
They are approaching municipal libraries?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. " '...but for all libraries of the world, wherever people have a sincere interest to go into the depths of Vedic philosophy.' Signed Murali S. Deora, Mayor of Bombay."

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Next, from the Indian Institute of Technology in Bombay. This is from Dr. Ram Kanstanari, Chairman of the Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences. " 'Sir: I am pleased to make the following comments concerning your beautiful and learned publications, //Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta// of Gosvāmī Kṛṣṇa Kavirāja and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// both written by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. I feel that these works are the result of Swami Prabhupāda's extraordinary commitment to the //bhakti// cult in the Indian tradition. Swami Prabhupāda's style and language are full of the flashes of his intuition. They clearly represent his realization that love for God and for mankind should be the foundation of all interpersonal relations. Kṛṣṇa is the symbol of this love. He is the Absolute in an incarnate form. Love for Kṛṣṇa therefore sung in all forms of devotion-laden language asserts man's empathy towards His entire creation. The Central Library of the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, has already secured, on my recommendation, the above-mentioned works complete. These works are read by the faculty and students here, not only for their religious message but also for the unique interpretation they embody of the traditional cult of //bhakti// in India. The poetic and devotionalistic tenor of these works, I am sure, would make one realize the meaning of man's dependence on God. I have no hesitation to state that His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda has done an immortal service to the movement of devotionism and Hinduism in particular and in world religions in general, by so ably bringing out these works in beautiful English. Every library in the world that is engaged in promoting the welfare of the human self by turning it towards the supremacy of the divine spirit...' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone is recommending. All libraries.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
“ '...should have on its shelf these works.' " Next is a letter from Trinvak Govind Meinpark[?], Professor of Sanskrit and Head of the Department at the University of Bombay. " 'His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, the renowned Vedic scholar and founder-//ācārya// of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, has translated into English the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// the Encyclopedia of Vedic Culture.' " Now it's getting to be known like that. " 'The special feature of this publication is to be seen in the explanatory notes, added with a view to summing up the purport of the passages rendered. The //Bhāgavatam// is a classic of the Kṛṣṇa cult, and in the manner of sweetness, sincerity of devotion and purity of emotion, it surpasses all other texts of the //Purāṇas,// as well as other texts of the //Bhāgavata// religion. As such it is no wonder that it has become a veritable scripture of the devotees of this cult. Again, of all incarnations of the highest Lord, the Kṛṣṇa incarnation has a peculiar fascination for the Indian mind and has all along exercised a great influence over the Hindu religious mind---in fact, of all minds that have God consciousness. The Lord's grace, His interest and deep concern for His devotees and even for sinners, His great love for all beings without any distinction of order, caste, creed and sex, His ever-willingness to look after all ardent devotees, His extreme sweetness, all these qualities have made Him the most easily lovable of the divine manifestations. The text of the //Bhāgavata,// scenes of the whole life of the Lord from His childhood to His withdrawal from the world, yet the philosophical aspects receive greater emphasis than the historical ones.' " Not simply that it's some stories; it's full of philosophy. " 'Along with the //Bhāgavata,// the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// has received as much care and attention in the translation by Śrīla Prabhupāda. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust is presenting these two sets as an encyclopedia of our culture, and our university has made a standing order of these volumes, which our students delight in reading. There is no doubt that the Swāmījī has immensely obliged all lovers of our Vedic culture and devotees of Kṛṣṇa cult by this simple, clear, faithful and illuminating rendering into English. The notes bring out beautifully the subtle implications of the Sanskrit and Bengali text. The lay reader is thus greatly helped in appreciating and understanding the brilliant simplicity of the path of //bhakti.//' "

**Prabhupāda:**
What he is?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He is the Head of the Department of Sanskrit at the Bombay University. " 'The printing is really excellent and the general get-up highly attractive. I have nothing but the highest praise for this splendid publication. The BBT's encyclopedia would be a valuable asset to each school and college library as well as all general libraries throughout the world.' " These reviews are as good as your books, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They're tremendous.

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
Another chapter.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here is a letter from the member of the advisory board of the Sāhitya Academy. You know what that is Śrīla Prabhupāda? Sāhitya Academy? I think it's a literary academy. " 'No earthly writer today can match the vast outpouring of pure verse which our ancient sages, particularly the great Vyāsadeva, have left to the world. Motivated by a deep desire to give moral, cultural and educational upliftment to all people irrespective of caste, creed or nationality, they have taught us the higher values of life through the medium of historical narrations, biographies, the lives of great men and simple instructive stories. The unlimited wealth which they have left behind in the Devanāgarī script is sheer ecstasy to read for the poet, the student and the common man. Since dialectic differences began to splinter men into smaller groups, the original language, Sanskrit, was gradually forgotten. It is special grace upon the denizens of this world today that His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda has done such a tremendous job of meticulously translating into so many languages the sacred books of our heritage. Swāmījī's most noteworthy achievement is his Encyclopedia of Vedic Education, the multivolume presentation of the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//' " One thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that this calling it the Encyclopedia of Vedic..., as he's doing, it has... Everyone has always known the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// but fewer people knew //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// and now these two are lumped together as equally very important works.

**Prabhupāda:**
Complete.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's very much increased...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...the notice of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// " 'His treatment of the verses through his transparent translations and purports show that his scholastic and spiritually realized grasp of the text is uncomparable. It is his understanding of the goal of all knowledge, as shown by his skillful pen, that makes him rightfully the founder and //ācārya// of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. I am very, very happy to see that many different types of libraries and institutions of the world are snapping up his encyclopedia.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
So the Communist country, they will be following that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
“ 'Any educational center interested in giving a complete education to its pupils should follow the example set by the University of California, the British Library, the Oxford University, and the University of Bombay, among many others, who have ordered sets of the BBT's encyclopedia. As an Indian, I am proud of the vast accomplishments of my fellow countryman, Swami Prabhupāda.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Maybe later on I can read some more of these to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They are very ecstatic. Yeah. Later on I'll read more to you. We haven't even touched this section. This is the list.

**Prabhupāda:**
So send Gargamuni many thanks for arranging in the libraries. Kṛṣṇa is blessing him. Organize your Bombay office very nicely, and arrange for printing enough stock. All money collected should be invested immediately. This is giving me new life, the all these. Somebody is proposing to give us some dairy land? Dairy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dairy land in Agra?

**Prabhupāda:**
Agra?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I heard also someone was proposing. One man who's staying here now is proposing four acres in Agra. They went today to see it. I think Bhagatjī went and also Akṣayānanda Mahārāja. They'll give you a report on it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Supply of //ghee// from that dairy land to [indistinct] compound would be very good.

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
We are also trying. We want to get some place near Delhi also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These are linked up---Delhi, Vṛndāvana, Agra.

**Bhāgavatāśraya:**
And Chandigarh. All those four centers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Four corners.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There was so much good news today I couldn't even begin to finish it. Now these things were waiting, see, under registered letter. Now I can always get them. //Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. [devotees offer obeisances] [end]
