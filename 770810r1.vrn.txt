====== Room Conversation ======

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When he came here...

**Prabhupāda:**
That means they condemned. They tried for the last, at least hundred years, to expand them.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. It didn't work.

**Prabhupāda:**
They dared to attack America even in that Pearl Harbor.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It seems like that was crazy, craziness. How they could have thought to attack America? [Prabhupāda chuckles] Like a mosquito trying to kill an elephant.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckling] //Apad kare viparīta-buddhi.//[?]

**Bhakti-caru:**
Some say that it was framed, because that way only got America involved in the war. And American generals knew about that attack on Pearl Harbor.

**Prabhupāda:**
And why they should attack? If they wanted to live there, they're welcome. Why should they attack? //Viparīta-buddhi.//

**Bhakti-caru:**
//Viparīta...?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Viparīta-buddhi.// Many Chinese people were living in America peacefully. They could also live, go. America would have welcomed them. They're very intelligent, artisans. Why attack? [pause] That's all right. Naturally it will be September.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Naturally it will be September? [Hindi in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, because... Who are they? Our men? Talking?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Pilgrims. Pilgrims. Villagers who come. They circumambulate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Our men should not talk with them. That's all right. And then what does he say further?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Then he says, "By September, Śani [Saturn] will enter the eighth house, and it could create further health troubles." September to October does not...

**Prabhupāda:**
But this will not counteract?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, well... See, what I read you was on page six. Now I'm going back to page five. In other words, after saying all of these things about the difficulties, then he said, "Now get a blue sapphire, and that shall counteract what I've already told you before." But you asked me after, so all I can tell you after is what it says here. It doesn't say what will happen after if you wear your blue sapphire. It only says what would happen ordinarily. I was explaining, though, that... When I saw Gurukṛpā Mahārāja, I said, "Gurukṛpā Mahārāja..." Because he was telling me how hard it was in Tokyo. He wasn't eating. Everything was bad. So I said, "But you look very strong. How is that?" He said, "One week in Hawaii. That's how." He said, "Simply one week in Hawaii." It is so healthful. The air, the water, the foodstuffs, the flowers... He said just breathing the flowers you can get strong.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] So if I feel little strength, I shall go to Hawaii.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Via Fiji? No. Hong Kong, like that. Hong Kong, Tokyo, Hawaii. We have... In Hong Kong and Tokyo we have both places a house if you should desire to go and stop overnight. Both places we have a house in the countryside. It might be easier to stay overnight in a hotel, because it's more centrally located. Because we wouldn't want to take a flight for very long. Hong Kong flight is not bad, I think maybe six, seven hours. Stay overnight. Then again to Tokyo is a short trip. And then Hawaii, another six hours. We can do like that. And Gurukṛpā knows the way very well there. Śrutakīrti will be coming here. I heard that Madhudviṣa is coming. Someone told me. Rāmeśvara sent him a ticket, and he's expected to come here any day. His wife had a child, a son. So he was saying after this child was born he was going to come to see you, and now that has happened. I don't know what his plan is.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's a fact: from the point of view of health, Hawaii is the best place in the world. It's paradise. There's nothing that can compare with it. And you'll get juices there. You can live on the fruit juices.

**Prabhupāda:**
And wherever there are my established Deities, that is Vṛndāvana. Anywhere I have got temple, that is Vṛndāvana. So wherever the health will remain very nice...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There we should go. I'll talk further with them. Find out what the climate is like, everything. Make sure. Wherever we go, we should pretty much be sure it is just nice. Would you like to hear some reading now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. You can sit down here. As far as possible, while reading //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// you should not sit down[?], because you are with //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Unless there is some inconvenience. So at least it should be on the same level. It is respect to //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// book. Sit down. [aside:] So you can bring milk?

**Upendra:**
Milk.

**Pradyumna:**
Chapter Six: "The Meeting of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
You take this opportunity to [indistinct]. It is great movement. If impartial inquiry is made by the Central Government, everything will be complete.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. And in the meantime, regarding America, he knows how we are. He can give report about what we are like in America. He's visited there.

**Prabhupāda:**
He can give. Everyone can write very nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. I mean he's very favorable towards us, so let him tell what we've done in America. We have wonderful temples. He knows this, the ambassador.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Phalena paricīyate:// "By result." We are spreading Hindu culture throughout the whole world. He has to judge from this point of view, by the result. The persons, the people who are accustomed to kill cows, they are giving up meat-eating. Do you think it is ordinary thing? So he has... He must have good judgment before giving any adverse opinion. Engaged in horrible cow slaughter, they are becoming Vaiṣṇavas. Is it ordinary thing? Nārada did. What is the //vyādha?//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Nārada Muni?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That hunter, Mṛgāri? He converted that hunter, Mṛgāri. He was killing, but then he would not trample even on one ant.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that is being done now. So he has to judge from this intelligence. We do not maintain any political view, what American government or Indian government... We want the whole people of the world, let them become human being. That is our movement. What is this? Simply killing business is going on. All governments should cooperate, pushing on this movement for humanity's sake.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually in Communist countries now, Eastern Europe, in the universities, they are cooperating. But why these Bengali Marxists, they are not? The Communists are cooperating.

**Prabhupāda:**
They know that we are the only enemy against their movement. Hmm. Let me...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
A letter has come from Haridāsa. In Bombay, your disciple, Haridāsa brahmacārī? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...by good association. This is the result of our movement. [break] [Bengali]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhakti-caru? Should I call for him?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm... Such nice color display, and there is no brain. The animal-killer civilization, Western country, has killed all their brain, good sense, good sentiment, everything.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Gone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rotten.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's a wonder how they take so many of Your Divine Grace's books.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they have got the capacity. //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]]. It has to be awakened by process. They've lost everything, but it can be revived.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We shouldn't give them a choice. We should insist that they revive it. Prabhaviṣṇu, according to that letter, it seems like in Bangladesh there's a very good reception.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere. [pause] [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[aside:] Behind. That's all right. [pause] Śrīla Prabhupāda? Prabhaviṣṇu has some Bengali articles. Should I call Bhakti-caru to read them?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Prabhaviṣṇu, you have come?

**Prabhaviṣṇu:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] There is a... There was a great Bengali poet. He was very rich man, Michael Madhusūdana Datta. So he went to England, and because he was extravagant, he spent all his money. So he was in difficulty. He begged some money from his countrymen, help him. But nobody gave him. Only there was a big //paṇḍita,// Isvaracandra Vidyasagar. He gave him the money. He thought that "Such a big man is in need of money. Let me... He may pay or not." So after receiving that money, he thanked Isvaracandra Vidyasagar, that "You have got courage of an Englishman and the heart of a Bengali mother." He was poet, so he gave these two examples: the courage of an Englishman and the heart of a Bengali mother. So you are Englishman. You are famous for your forefathers' courage to expand British Empire. The America is also your creation. But everything in this material world deteriorates. That is not fault. But Englishmen were, at least formerly, famous for courage, enthusiasm, expansion of prestige. This Lord Clive was a crewman in a ship, and he established British Empire. So you have to show that Englishman courage. So you have done something which has proved Englishman courage. And go on doing it. That is your heritage. And two nice fields, Bangladesh and Nepal. Nepal is only Hindu free state, or it is called... Now India is also free, at least...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The only Hindu kingdom.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. They have got a sentiment of Hinduism. So with their cooperation, a little foreign exchange, you can establish a stronghold there. It will be a great service. So how much foreign exchange will be required, minimum, to establish a stronghold there?

**Prabhaviṣṇu:**
Well, actually, they have a regulation that when foreigners come into the country they all have to change at least 150 dollars a month per person.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that we can spare very easily.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many men you want to go with you?

**Prabhaviṣṇu:**
To begin with, about four or five devotees.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All foreigners?

**Prabhaviṣṇu:**
No. Four foreigners, and there's one Nepali boy I'd like to take also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So six hundred dollars a month. Hundred and fifty dollars times four.

**Prabhupāda:**
That we can spare. Arrange for that, and make a stronghold there with the cooperation of government officials. I'll pay six hundred dollars. You'll get. I'll pay or anyone. Hmm? I have got some money in London, also in America. So you have some bank account, and I shall advise Lloyd's Bank will send.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They might like that. He's British, and the money will come from England.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's a new twist. Usually they're always seeing our money coming from America, but his money will come from England.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I think I have got six thousand pounds.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's a good amount.

**Prabhupāda:**
At least for few months I can continue. This is first business. Do it. And another point, that formerly the Britishers expanded empire. Now we have got better service. They... You expand the empire of consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is also the same view, but it is spiritual. Kṛṣṇa has given you the ability. Do it enthusiastically with the courage of an Englishman and the heart of a Bengali mother.

**Prabhaviṣṇu:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Bangladesh when we were doing programs, after the programs we'd distribute books, and there was such a great rush for books that we had to stay inside a locked room and sell the books through bars in the window.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's very encouraging.

**Prabhaviṣṇu:**
Everywhere we went the people would...

**Prabhupāda:**
The best thing is that in Bangladesh you get foreign exchange. You print books there. It think it is cheaper there. Never mind for the quality, but you'll get good number of books. The government will be pleased.

**Prabhaviṣṇu:**
Yes. Then we can export the books also into West Bengal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In this way organize these two places with the courage of an Englishman and the heart of a Bengali mother. And we should ventilate in the papers that this Indian investment of American money is not American money; it is my money. I have written books, laboring whole night. The American boys have cooperated with me by printing, by distributing, and the money was received by selling the books. So the books are mine. I have given to the Society. So I have done business, regular, in foreign countries. I have earned money and spending the same money in my country. It is not American money; it is my money. I have done business. That's all. It is a credit for Indian son so to do such tremendous business and bring money for investing in his own country, from the national point of view. Why the...? The Americans are not claiming that it is their money. They are my disciples; they are cooperating with me. Actually it is a business. I have done business, I have earned money and brought it at home to spend. Everyone does. They should not misunderstand that I have stolen money from America and brought it. It is fair business. That's all. Ventilate this. They are under impression that the American government is supplying, the World Bank is supplying. Nobody is supplying. I am earning money by business, by my hard labor. Hmm?

**Devotee:**
Yes. That is fact.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ventilate this.

**Prabhaviṣṇu:**
It is very important to make this known to everyone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "Money belongs to Bhaktivedanta Swami by hard labor. We are his disciples. We are helping." It is mutual cooperation. [referring to medicine:] Actually, I do not like to take.

**Bhakti-caru:**
//Ācchā// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
What do you think? Should I take?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is that //kavirāja// medicine?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, I don't see how it is having so much effect.

**Prabhupāda:**
No effect.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Powder isn't working effectively, and milk is keeping you going. I don't see that this medicine is doing anything. It's not giving you appetite.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not even taste.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No. It's giving you bad taste. You don't like to take it.

**Prabhupāda:**
So your opinion not to take?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, if you don't... My opinion is that if you feel that... I don't see that it's having any effect. I think the milk is the best thing---milk, mango milk like you're taking, little juices. This is for creating appetite, I think.

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Take the courage of an Englishman and the heart of a Bengali mother. [end]
