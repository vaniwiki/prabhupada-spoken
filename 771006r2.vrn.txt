**Prabhupāda:**
Of course, if I die, there is nothing to be ruined. You are all participants. So organize this farm project, simple living. Human life is meant for God realization. Try to help them. This is my...

**Paramānanda:**
We're always feeling your presence very strongly, Śrīla Prabhupāda, simply by your teachings and your instructions. We're always meditating on your instructions.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. That is the real presence. Physical presence is not important.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Mother Satyabhāmā, she wrote a short note to you. Should I read it to you?

**Prabhupāda:**
Um-hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
She said, "Dear Śrīla Prabhupāda, please accept my most humble obeisances. All glories to Your Divine Grace. This shawl is made of the wool from our own sheep, spun and woven here at Gītā-nagarī. It is the first piece we have made. While I was working on it I would always think of you, of how I was supposedly making you a gift. But actually you are giving me the gift of engagement in devotional service. Śrīla Prabhupāda, I always pray to Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva to protect you and allow you to stay with us to finish your books. But I think today the rain falling from the sky is actually the tears of the demigods, crying at the prospect of your departure. I am also crying. Even Kṛṣṇa cried at the passing of Grandfather Bhīṣma, so I have a right to cry. I cannot be so philosophical to say that you are always present in your books and teachings, though I know these things are true. I will miss you so much, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if you go. I beg that I may always remain your menial servant and devotee. Your humble disciple, Satyabhāmā dāsī."

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank to her. Made with our wool.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So you'll take rest now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Um-hmm. This can be on the foot. Yes. //Āp.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is it warm?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm, very nice. Very comfortable. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa... Made with our wool.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Would you like a little sweet singing, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [//kīrtana// begins] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali conversation] Why not consult with father and son?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Which one is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
The father's name is...

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
[indistinct name], Harinam Place?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Harinam Place?

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
[indistinct name] His one son is doctor. Raman Medical Store in Loi Bazaar, near Post office.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's a doctor, famous doctor. Cures people.

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
He has own chambers, medical store.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't advise it, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I don't think it's a good idea to do. Because I don't see why we don't consult all twenty thousand doctors. I mean, why is he... Sac-cid-ānanda just happened to be... He goes to the shop and he sees the man's shop. Why not wait for Dr. Ghosh or call Dr. Ghosh here? I mean, what I'm trying to say is that if I go to Mathurā, I'll also pass many medical shops, so I could consult any one of those men, probably, just as well.

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
That's a fact.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's a fact, huh.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have got good practice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Because Vṛndāvana is small, so everybody has to go to whoever is the doctor here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They are //kavirājī// or allopathic?

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
He also both using, //kavirājī// also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He does... He's both. He says you can do either one with him. You can take allopathic or //kavirāja.// He gives both. Whatever the patient likes. Right?

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
He is making some //kavirāja// also medicines.

**Prabhupāda:**
His father practices //haikin.//[?] And the son practices...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Allopathic. I think we're letting ourselves in for trouble when we call these doctors.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
My personal opinion is that when you call these doctors, you're simply letting..., we are simply letting ourselves in for more trouble, because they're not going to study the case very carefully. They're just going to start prescribing. Your case is so delicate that the slightest wrong diagnosis and medicine causes havoc.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they have good practice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But the same thing, as they were recommended, similarly, this //kavirāja// in Bombay was recommended. [Prabhupāda coughing] We can call him, but...

**Prabhupāda:**
Consult him.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I've lost hope with these doctors, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I'll consult if you insist, but I... I mean... I've lost hope. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
And they know me also very well.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So you want me to bring them here?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he'll bring.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He can bring them here, and then they can examine you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All right. You think you can bring the father and son here? All right. You think you can bring them this evening? This afternoon or evening?

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
At four o'clock.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You'll leave here at four o'clock?

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
What time is it?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now it is ten past three. You'll leave at four, and they'll get here by 4:35. That's all right. That's a good time. Let us see, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Maybe they can... I mean, I'm just not a blind follower of these doctors anymore. Experience makes one...

**Sac-cid-ānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No harm in their coming, especially if they know you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
They know me very well.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sometimes you were doing business with them?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. As Vṛndāvana inhabitant. This father came to speak here last year.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh. Should I send another telegram for Bhakti-caru? I think it might be helpful. Because more than likely, whichever doctors come, they speak Hindi or Bengali. I think it would be helpful to have him here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Simple... [coughing] [break] [end]
