[kirtan] [whispering]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
What meeting is going on?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We had two meetings today. One meeting was the BBT meeting for the completion of the Bombay project. And then another meeting was about our community Gītā-nagarī. Describing how it will be... Dhṛṣṭadyumna Mahārāja has come with his brother, who's the architect. And we're having a meeting for planning this ideal community very exactly, everything. The people present at the meeting are Bhavānanda Mahārāja and Paramānanda, Vāmanadeva, Dhṛṣṭadyumna Mahārāja, Tripurāri Mahārāja, Balavanta, Rūpānuga. All of these people have experience with..., you know, like Bhavānanda in Māyāpur. Balavanta has two farms; Rūpānuga, all of these people. In other words, we're just trying to plan out... And Surabhi Mahārāja. And Dhṛṣṭadyumna Mahārāja's brother is an architect. In fact I've just been told that his architectural firm is the same one that's designing the... What is that? Designing a big thing in Tehran for the Shah of Iran. It's a very big architectural firm. So we're just trying to plan a very ideal community. We don't want to make a hodgepodge of it. I mean, it should be so ideal that it becomes one of the most wonderful preaching tools for our movement, to show that "Here is an ideal community based upon Vedic principles, and it's perfect in every respect." So it takes a little cooperative thought and planning. That's why we've invited so many people to sit in the meeting.

**Prabhupāda:**
I was very happy when I heard, respectable gentlemen, out of love they are washing dishes. You know that? Ātreya Ṛṣi told me.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. In Iran. Some important people in Iran, just out of some..., to do some service, they're even going in the restaurant and assisting by washing the dishes, and they're bringing things here and there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Phew. It's really devotional.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are so gentle.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's what we're feeling with this community also, that actually people will become so much impressed with this wonderful way of life that they'll want to take part voluntarily. If something is done very nicely, if Kṛṣṇa consciousness is presented very nicely, then any gentleman will want to take part.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. That is good. That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Many people will come to this community to see how it is done. I think it will become very, very important in many different respects---for farmers, for people who are interested in designing ideal communities, for so many people who would like to live an ideal life, for people who want to come and see a unique place to visit---because there will be a temple of Kṛṣṇa-Arjuna there, a doll exhibit. I think it can be a wonderful preaching opportunity. And most wonderful of all is if we can exhibit self-sufficiency, that simply by farming the land, we can get enough grains, and taking care of the cows, we can get enough good foods to keep the body healthy. We can produce our own clothing. This is very much needed in this age. It's a positive alternative to artificial civilization. And the center will be Kṛṣṇa. All of the different activities and //varṇas// will be demonstrated, and all the different //āśramas// will be ideally being lived by the different devotees. People will see everything that they're doing is here but in its pure form and everyone working happily and cooperatively together. Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in order for it to really work you have to come there, to be very honest. I know it will never be there unless you come and stay with us there and just show us and teach us. 'Cause I've seen practically that although everything is already written, Your Divine Grace has had to come and show personally a little bit, "Do like this; do like that." As the //ācārya,// you have adjusted everything perfectly to suit the situation of the present day and age. No one else could do that, none of your Godbrothers. No one in India could ever do that except you. So you are required. Everything is there, but you are also..., you have to be there. Otherwise I don't know if it's actually possible. And it's very important. You have to get better, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We're prepared to stay with you---all of the devotees feel this way---to encourage you to get better. Our plans are there, we're there, but we need you. You have to be there with us to guide us. I think that this disease is simply Kṛṣṇa testing our actual..., our love for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, so that we will learn that we fully need you, 'cause actually we do. Everything we've done in this movement you've guided us with. We're realizing that you have to continue to guide us. We're not self-realized. We simply are able to carry out your instructions. So we have nothing else to do but to be with you here until you get healthy again and then lead us. This is our business now---to be with you. It seems like there are so many opportunities now that are beginning to present themselves. When you first went to the West there was nothing at all, and you created a whole world of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And now the public is beginning to actually take a real interest in our movement, and people, respectable people from all over the world, are coming forward to want to help our movement. So there's a great facility that's available now even more than ten years ago. So if we've made so much progress in ten years, in another ten years there's no way to measure how much our movement can be expanded. And we're all just ready to follow each one of your directions. You don't have to tax yourself by... You can just talk to us and tell us, and we'll act. And we're very happy. In the meantime, we will give you the medicine of //hari-nāma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. That is real medicine.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think that our being here and chanting before you is spreading this movement, because the more we chant, the more love and dependence we develop for you, and that's making us strong in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and therefore our movement is getting stronger. Every day that we stay here, we become stronger in our devotion for you and dependence on you. [pause] I think that I should just tell them to end their meeting now. They're waiting for me, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Then I'll come back in a little while and chant. Actually you have to get better, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja has built this palace. It's only meant for you. We were seeing pictures of it today. It is so beautiful. It is exactly the place that you want to retire in and translate. And this community of Gītā-nagarī will be just proper place to give direction how to establish nice spiritual community. These two places are very close to each other---New Vrindavan and Gītā-nagarī. They're only three hours away from each other. Two very good communities for showing the example how to spread ideal Vedic life. We were discussing that actually it is not anything new that Kṛṣṇa can make His devotee better, because we were reading before in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// how sometimes Lord Caitanya would bring back to life someone who had even expired. And His associates were able to do that. And there is many cases. I think if we are very determined, then Kṛṣṇa will surely fulfill our desire.

**Prabhupāda:**
Without fail.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Without fail.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Without fail. [chuckles]

**Hari-śauri:**
//Jaya.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And I can see even though this is a difficult time, actually it's still very sublime, because... This is wonderful, that all of your senior disciples are coming and we're all chanting, and you're hearing and we're hearing. And actually it's a very wonderful... Even though it's critical, it's very wonderful, because we're all chanting the holy name. And then gradually Kṛṣṇa will answer our prayers. And in the meantime we're becoming purified by chanting like this, and you're pleased by hearing our chanting. Most people, when they are ill, everything is very horrible. But this is very different. It's all spiritual. So we're very satisfied. Of course, we want you to get better immediately. But still, as long as it takes, we're very satisfied to remain chanting and expecting Kṛṣṇa's mercy at every moment. //Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda. I'll come back in a little while, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I'll just end that meeting. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Girirāja:**
I had a very wonderful meeting with the chairman of the bank. And he's ready to do anything to satisfy us and keep our business. So he said that he was going to get rid of the man who is on this counter, Mr. Gupta, and give us some more young, dynamic, cooperative person to be in charge over here. And we completed the formalities for transferring the fixed deposits to the main branch, and he assured me that it was a completely routine transaction, and that if the local people tried to do anything to stop it, that he would himself personally see that it went through smoothly. So I gave them the certificates. It was not necessary to sign them. We just gave the certificates, and they gave us a receipt. And they're going to endorse the certificates so they are payable from New Delhi instead of from Vṛndāvana, and then we can go and collect them. And the chairman also called the assistant general manager, and he was also very nice and very sympathetic. So he's going to come on Saturday, and he's going to look into everything, all the difficulties here. And I said that he could bring his family and they could take //prasādam.// So they're all going to be coming on Saturday at about eleven o'clock. I had submitted a letter with eleven things that we wanted---you know, we want the hours to be regular, we wanted a new person here, we wanted our interest on time---just a list of different things. And he said that there's no problem, and they're just ready to do whatever we want. I mean, they gave the impression that they would dismiss any number of people here that were giving us trouble. But I said that I thought that the main person was this Mr. Gupta, and so they said they would replace him. It was very good. But still, even if there are improvements here, I think it's better to keep the fixed deposits in New Delhi...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Girirāja:**
...because they are the responsible people. It's a big city, cosmopolitan, and these small towns there's always danger that, you know.

**Prabhupāda:**
So certificate must be transferred there.

**Girirāja:**
Yes. Well, we've given them the certificates and the letter, and they've taken the responsibility. They're sending the certificates by registered post to the Vṛndāvana people with their instructions to transfer the money to New Delhi. So those will definitely reach here by Saturday, when the assistant general manager comes. And if there's any hesitation, the assistant general manager will take care of it when he's here on Saturday. And I would think that by Monday or Tuesday we could get the certificates changed officially. And then, I think, we should have at least one account in their main branch in New Delhi. It would probably be easier to get inward remittances there. And if we want the interest from the fixed deposits to be kept there, we can have an account there for that. And that will keep us in good contact with the head office.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Hmm. [break]

**Lokanātha:**
No books in India have such illustrations, such beautiful illustrations. Everyone appreciates. So far, we had small books, but now we have //Bhāgavatam,// we have //Teachings of Lord Caitanya// in Hindi. They are purchasing. And all those who purchase books will definitely read your books. So far, we were giving big books to Life Members, free, towards their donation, but not many of them were reading. Some of them were reading. But now those who purchase books by paying money, they definitely will read. Because they have a liking for reading, so they will read. And our sales are increasing. Hindi books are being sold more and more.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Upendra?

**Lokanātha:**
Upendra.

**Upendra:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Upendra? If I sit down like this, between the two loins, I... It gives me pain.

**Upendra:**
In the lower spine?

**Abhirāma:**
That's that sore.

**Upendra:**
What about that pillow, that round pillow?

**Abhirāma:**
The bigger one is round.

**Upendra:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Do you remember that little round pillow with the hole in the center? Do you think that would help? No. It's... You put it... Or if you lean.

**Prabhupāda:**
That part, if I sit down too long, that part gives me pain.

**Upendra:**
Then you can lay..., sit up for maybe five minutes sometime, and again in the afternoon for five minutes, little time, and then we can lay you down now if you like. We don't have to keep you up for real long. But just the sitting up helps a little bit, and then, when there is some discomfort, too much, then we can lay down again. [end]
