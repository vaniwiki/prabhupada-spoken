**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali] Prabhupāda said, "I kick them on their face." "I literally kick them on their face." [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with Bhakti-caru]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[to Upendra] Śrīla Prabhupāda wants that Bonamali Prabhu, that //kavirāja.// Should go and talk to him tomorrow. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They showed film?

**Upendra:**
Today, I don't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Upendra:**
Let me look at today's program. Yes. At 8:30, just now, films. And then tomorrow also at 8:30, films and slides. [break] Whatever you say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is being recorded, and then Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Hari-śauri, they're all busy copying down, rewriting into their diaries, 'cause your words are so nectarine. And then all the devotees are anxious to hear. So then they copy down from them. It's like a little press, already. Bhakti-caru... If you speak in Bengali, then Bhakti-caru also translates.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Tamāla?

**Upendra:**
Tamāla is in the next room. Shall I call him?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Upendra:**
He's writing in his diary.

**Prabhupāda:**
And where is...? What is his name? Come from Māyāpur.

**Upendra:**
Māyāpur? Jayapatākā? Bhakti-caru?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Upendra:**
Oh, Abhirāma?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Upendra:**
Oh, Śatadhanya?

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhava?

**Upendra:**
Oh, Bhavānanda. He's with the conference. All the devotees went to the conferences on and off today.

**Prabhupāda:**
The conference still going?

**Upendra:**
Yes. Movies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Hmm.

**Upendra:**
[to Tamāla:] He just wanted to know where you were.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'm here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I've been in this building all day. [temple bell rings 9 times] It's nice weather now. In the evenings it's very comfortable. You can feel. Not too hot or humid. Bhavānanda's a little... He has a little stomach pain. That's why he's not here tonight. But he said if there's any urgent thing, we should wake him up or immediately bring him. I mean if there's anything that you want him for at any time, he can immediately be called.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Do you like to turn on one side?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Turn me.

**Upendra:**
Would you like this side for a change, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'll be in the next room, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] Shall I get the report? You want me to get the report of the astrologer?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. Here's Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So the final inauspicious day is not come yet.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Final inauspicious day?

**Prabhupāda:**
Means death.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What does that mean? The final inauspicious date?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is the... That means death.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Fatal day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'll just look. [pause] What does this mean, "//Ketu Mahādaśā//"? What is the meaning of that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ketu,// the most inauspicious.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Most inauspicious? Well, it says, "You're presently undergoing the fag end of //Ketu Mahādaśā,// and it will last until 13th of January, 1978." I mean, it mentions a lot of things here. I don't understand these astrological terms. I could read them to you. If you understand them, I can read them to you. I don't understand them. Just like I just mentioned //Ketu Mahādaśā.// To me that didn't mean anything, 'cause I didn't understand it.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Pradyumna understands.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Where is he?

**Jayādvaita:**
In the reception room.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should I read these out loud to you? Should I read these things to you?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should... Pradyumna is here also. He's in the next room. Should I call him?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Get Pradyumna. [break] [indistinct background discussion about the report] ...is that end of the //Ketu Mahādaśā,// because it says, "Astrologically it is up to eighty-one years, four months, approximate." Eighty-one years, four months would make it about January 1978. So that's the date given, January 13th, 1978. Pradyumna, why don't you come over here and read this, 'cause I can't understand all these things. Just read loud and clear to Prabhupāda. Start here.

**Pradyumna:**
"Śrīla Prabhupādajī is at present undergoing the fag end of //Ketu Mahādaśā,// and it will last till 13th January, 1978. //Ketu// is in the eighth house with Sun, lord of eighth house, and //Guru, Bṛhaspati,// lord of the twelfth and third houses. Mercury and //Ketu// started from 16/1 1977. //Budha... Budha ṣaṣṭheśa[?]// also." //Ṣaṣṭheśa// means lord of house of disease. That is not good. //Budha// is Mercury. Mercury is //ṣaṣṭheśa// also. Disease. That means disease, //Budha.// "//Śani// has gone to eighth house, house of death, from 7th September, 1977."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's Prabhupāda's appearance day.

**Pradyumna:**
"//Śani// is //lagneśa// in the eighth house and in transit over Jupiter from 24th September, exact, and //Ketu// from 16th September, exact."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What does that mean? Unless you know astrology...

**Pradyumna:**
That is not good, with this //Śani// and //Ketu.// "A negative effect continues throughout October 1977 to November 1977, and from lst of December, 1977, Saturn becomes almost stationary." This is not a good time. "And becomes more malefic." That means it goes //vakribhāva,// it goes retrograde, and that is not good. "In January 1978..." That is dangerous time. "In January 1978 to April 1978, it again traverses the same degrees and becomes stagnant on Jupiter." In other words, //Śani,// Saturn, is going over, has just gone over some planets, and that was very dangerous. And it will go up. And then it will become very, very slow, and it will stop, and then it will reverse and go over the same planets again. And that again will be very dangerous time. //Vakribhāva:// it will become retrograde, will go in reverse motion. "It again traverses the same degrees and becomes stagnant on Jupiter and //Ketu// in the last week of February 1978." Stagnant means becomes stationary. It won't move.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
For how long?

**Pradyumna:**
That will only be for a day or two. It becomes very slow again, and then it will start up again. When it becomes slow it does this[?] again. So that is why he's saying that is a bad time. You have this bad time when it went over, now it comes back, and it will start again. "The native has //dīrghāyu,// above seventy-five years of longevity." Means you have //dīrghāyu,// long life, above seventy-five years. But he cannot say how long. In the //praśna-lagna...// He has done //praśna,// questioned how long will Prabhupāda live. He will do //praśna,// special chart. He will make calculation. "In the //praśna-lagna,// Moon applies to Jupiter on the first day..."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What day is this? Fourth October.

**Pradyumna:**
Moon applies the first day... Moon applies to Mars on the second day, Moon applies to //Śani...// Moon applies to //Śukra,// mixed. He has asked... When someone asks a question, that is //praśna.// So when you ask a question, he will do a special chart and he will calculate to find just the answers to that question. So he has done this for some //praśna,// and he's saying that in this //praśna// question he has given the positions. And in the eighth house... The Moon and Jupiter and Mars are in the eighth house. He says in parenthesis, "Very bad. The patient may not recover." These planets are in the eighth house, so eighth house is... That is not a good house. "//Śani,// with Venus in //kendra.//" That is also not good. //Śani// is bad, Venus is good, but //Śani...,// Saturn, is bad. "In //varṣa-lagna.//" Then he has made another chart for //varṣa-phala,// to see what will happen this year, beginning of year, what happened. When the year began, he'll make another //varṣa-phala.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When is that? In the beginning of the coming year?

**Pradyumna:**
Well, sometimes they make //varṣa-phala// for the birthday. Whatever Prabhupāda's birthday is, on that day this year they make one. On the day it was September 7, he'll make a chart exactly at that time, and then he'll see where the planets are. That will tell what will come till next birthday.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So when did he do it for? On the birthday?

**Pradyumna:**
I don't know when he's..., which day he's done it for. It's probably done it for the birthday this year. He's given some positions, and he said, "Not good." He said, "Mars is with Saturn in conjunction. Very bad. Hospitalization and ill health intensified in the present year. The days not good when the Moon passes in the 22nd, 23rd //nakṣatra.//"

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When is that? Then he gives those days.

**Pradyumna:**
"27th, 28th September."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's past.

**Pradyumna:**
"And 24th, 25th October, and 20th, 21st, 22nd November, and 3rd and 4th December. In the //praśna-lagna,// lord eighth house, enemy of Saturn, //Sūrya// will apply to //Rāhu.//" This is coming now... This is past. Yes, it is past. That is on 28th...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Eighth October.

**Pradyumna:**
Yes. That was 8th.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Praśna-lagna.//

**Pradyumna:**
"//Sūrya// will come, transited //Rāhu.//" This was on 8th October.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Strength of //lagna.//"

**Pradyumna:**
Now he is telling in this //praśna-lagna// some points. When he did this //praśna,// lord of //lagna// was //Maṅgala,// or Mars. So this lord of //lagna// is in eighth house. That is not a good sign. First he says, "The strength of //lagna// means nil." //Lagna// means health. //Lagna// means the personality and the health. So strength of //lagna,// strength of health---nil. "Two, seventh house. Seventh and second house are disease---strong." Health is weak and disease is strong. "Posited in tenth house. The native will not come up..."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Astrologically.

**Pradyumna:**
"...astrologically."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is that?

**Pradyumna:**
I don't know what it means, but...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Come up."

**Pradyumna:**
It means astrologically it doesn't seem he is... It is not very good prediction. And third point is that the fourth lord is aspecting. "Regarding the medicine---will not give any relief. The native will make a fight for life as //Sūrya, Maṅgala// are good friends, and //Śani// and //Śukra// are //śatru,// or enemies. There is no benefics in nine, six, eleven and three."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What does that mean?

**Pradyumna:**
These are houses. Benefic means a good planet. So ninth house is a good house. There is no... Six is house of disease, but there's nothing good there, only something bad. Ninth house is prosperity. Nothing good there. Eleventh house is gain. Nothing good there. Third house, not so... [break] But it aspects the ninth. Nothing. Nothing to bring the opposite. "//Maṅgala// indicates effects of..."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Śakini.//

**Pradyumna:**
//Śakini?// "//Pitar Jaladevi//[?] combined. Difficulty in recovery." Then another point: "The seventh //daśā// starts." So this is Venus, //Śukra-daśā.// "The seventh //daśā// starts on 13th January, 1978. This is ending of seven years."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
For three years it goes. Says it goes for three years. [indistinct comments]

**Pradyumna:**
Oh, I'm sorry---"We have noticed that the periods are all negative until March or April 1978, and main trouble was due to //Śani.// We have suggested that the blue sapphire be tried, and he should keep it, putting." He should keep it on. "Hospitalization and travels indicated. The only remedy in this case is to do //mahā-mṛtyuṁ jaya japa// and //havana.// Previously also, now also, we have recommend: Śiva is the presiding deity of //Śani,// and with this the native will be able to overcome disease and life span increases. Astrologically, it is up to eighty-one years, four months, approximately. //Japa// and //havana...//"

**Kīrtanānanda:**
What is up to eighty-four years?

**Pradyumna:**
Eighty-one years, four months.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Is what?

**Pradyumna:**
That is astrologically the length of life approximately.

**Prabhupāda:**
So this //japa, mahā-mantra-japa,// and //Bhāgavata-pāṭha,// that I am doing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And what?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śrīmad-Bhāgavata-pāṭha.// So either read //Bhāgavata// or chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And let me lie down like this, that's all, as it is going on. Huh? Can you make this program?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This program is already going on.

**Prabhupāda:**
And let it go on. That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And you should try to drink and eat whenever you have a little desire.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You shouldn't try to fast until death.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That is useless. Do you recommend that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, definitely not. I recommend that somehow or other, you go on lying there, and we'll go on chanting, and we'll pass until March-April '78. Then we'll take you to Māyāpur for the festival, and then we'll do a world tour.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is very nice program. You can read //Bhāgavata// from the point where I have stopped.

**Pradyumna:**
//Daśāma-skandha?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is it possible? Eh?

**Pradyumna:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
And when he is tired, //kīrtana,// go on. Kīrtanānanda. This is //mahājana-mahā-kīrtana.// And as far as possible, let me lie down like this. What can be done? Is that conclusion all right?

**Upendra:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is saying yes?

**Upendra:**
Upendra dāsa. Tamāla, he's asking you.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, but we... I also say that as your sister Pisimā is here, whenever you like, she may cook something and you take. And take //Yamunā-jāl,// little sweet lemon juice. I mean, take things also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
As you are doing. Not fast. No... You shouldn't artificially fast or stop eating.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. That is suicidal.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right. [chuckles] We don't want suicide.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, when you are beginning?

**Pradyumna:**
Right now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do it. //Śubha-suśīghram[?].// Upendra, you keep honey ready...

**Upendra:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
...whenever I shall require. [end]
