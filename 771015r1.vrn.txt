**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This morning your urine was very colored again.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So actually the //kavirāja// says that the actual cure is simply to drink liquids. In Bombay you were drinking about 600 cc's of liquid a day. It wasn't very difficult. Say, at about four or five times in a day you'd drink about a half a cup of liquid. That's all it took. It wasn't difficult, and it all came out very easily as urine. Because you had that operation performed, there's no blockage. Simply we have to sit you up four or five times, which you're doing anyway in a day, drink a little liquid, and then you can lay down. And automatically it will come out as urine. And because you have liquid, it will clean out the poisons. If you take no liquid, then it's very dangerous.

**Prabhupāda:**
I can.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You don't have to eat anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
I can.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You can just drink.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I can.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very good. [aside to Hari-śauri:] So, can I see that book? So about in a half hour we can give you some juice maybe? Grape juice? Do you like grape juice?

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever you give me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. We'll just talk amongst ourselves and decide what you should take.

**Prabhupāda:**
But don't give much.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No. You should drink simply like a half a cup. Is that too much? In Bombay we used to give you a full cup. But we can give you half a cup here. And you try and drink a half a cup. It's only about a 100 cc's. You do that few times in a day, four or five times, then there'll be no problem. I don't think it's very painful to drink, is it?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is the reason you haven't been doing it the last few days?

**Prabhupāda:**
I cannot...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You cannot...? What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
[coughs up mucus]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't think this milk should be given again, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It has caused maybe this mucus. So we'll give you something to drink after half hour. Okay. [end]
