====== Room Conversation ======

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But if I can give my opinion, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The main necessity right now is not just sleep, because you've been sleeping for many days, and that hasn't gotten you better. Sleeping, of course, is easier. When one is laying down, it's a little disturbing to the mind if he cannot sleep all the time, but sleeping is not so necessary as getting some nourishment.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no... Without sleeping, the brain will be...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[laughs] But you have been sleeping a lot, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You were sleeping so much yesterday, and even while you're taking these medicines. In other words, the idea with the allopathic medicine is that it does many good things. So I'm sure Dr. Ghosh could recommend something to help you sleep. [some whispering about going to go and see Dr. Ghosh]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dr. Ghosh might be able to recommend something to help you sleep.

**Prabhupāda:**
And they will help this, this, this...

**Bhavānanda:**
That's why we thought, Prabhupāda, we could go to the //kavirāja,// and he would give a mild medicine for helping to induce sleep.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about the other medicines?

**Bhavānanda:**
If Prabhupāda could just take it today, one day more, because, Prabhupāda, the good sign is that your urine was more clear than ever, this morning at five-thirty. And that was due to the allopathic medicine.

**Hari-śauri:**
It definitely seems to be having a good effect.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The only bad effect is that you're having a little difficulty last night in sleeping. Is there any other bad effect?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the worst effect.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But the //kavirājī// could give something for inducing sleep, or Dr. Ghosh could give something. If you can sleep, then the other things are not bad. So why not just take something which will help you to sleep? Then, if the other good things are there, why not continue? I mean...

**Bhavānanda:**
If the infection from the kidney goes away... But everyone agrees that that has to be taken away. That is the fatal, fatal infection. //Kavirāja// and allopathic all agree that that urine must become clear and that infection is dispelled.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And that you have to get... The other thing that they all stress the most is that you're very, very weak. So the only complaint now is that you cannot sleep properly. But that's not very difficult. They can give you some, you know, something to help you sleep.

**Bhavānanda:**
And that masseur can come this morning and give you a massage.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Why didn't he come yesterday?

**Bhavānanda:**
They told him not to come. I told him to come in the afternoon.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who told him?

**Bhavānanda:**
Viśvambhara and Dr. Ghosh. But he can give you a good massage. That will help.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Have you been drinking much this morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [whispered discussion about grape juice]

**Bhavānanda:**
We can cut the dosage of the medicine in half.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Why not just give something that helps Prabhupāda to sleep? That's the easiest thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Want to turn that side? Or straight?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Hari-śauri:**
His shoulder's on the pillow.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Cover? Would you like covering?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? No cover.

**Bhavānanda:**
No cover?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The main thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that you get some strength. I mean, you were sleeping so much, and you weren't getting any better. The sleeping is necessary, but you shouldn't sacrifice. In order to sleep you should not sacrifice those things which give strength and which take away this disease. You have to get strength, get rid of the disease, and be able to rest nicely. That we have seen, that the //kavirāja's// medicine is not so effective, neither simply doing without any medicine is so effective. We have not tried allopathic medicine, because within a day or two you always stop it. Whenever you take for one day, then you say, "No more." I think that this... If you want to get better, you have to take some cure. No cure---that is not good. And switching from one thing to the other, that is also not good. Why not follow some series of cure, regular, and stay with it for some time? We're not going to let anything severe be done. That's for sure. And Dr. Ghosh has come very long distance, and this other doctor he is taking the help of is supposed to be expert doctor. So in such a critical condition, why not take their help? What can be gained by again changing to this Bonamali? Just because there was a little inability for sleep, why should you give up all of the, you know, regimentations which they're prescribing? Just like sometimes...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they say, "You drink this, drink this, drink this."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But Prabhupāda, unless you drink a...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That's all right, but the drinking forcibly, that is a great botheration.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But isn't it... I mean the greatest botheration is that you're not well. And the reason you're not well is that you have no strength. And unless you take in, you're not going to get any strength.

**Prabhupāda:**
So how can I take constantly?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It may be bothersome, but it's not so bothersome as being in this ill condition. In order to get better, it seems to me that it's going to be some botheration in order to get better.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, bother... What botheration? I cannot take so much.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
See, it would be easier if we only had to give you three or four times in a day, but you take so little at a time...

**Prabhupāda:**
What can I do?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Can't you...? I mean...

**Bhavānanda:**
They said that one of the symptoms of this infection is---this poisoning---is that you become averse to taking any liquid or any food. Just like you're expressing your aversion that you're not able to. But actually you are able to, but you don't want to. But you have to force yourself in order to get better.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then, then the same problem comes, and they will forcibly...

**Bhavānanda:**
[whispering] Hospital.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But, Prabhupāda, one thing is that if you expect to simply naturally feel like doing this or that, how can you expect something..., to feel naturally hungry if you're ill? Unless the disease goes away... Then naturally you'll feel like drinking and eating. Just like you described to us, when a person is not Kṛṣṇa conscious he has to force himself to get up early, force himself to chant, force himself to go to //ārati.// Naturally he doesn't feel like these things in the conditioned stage. So similarly, when one is in a diseased condition, naturally he won't feel like taking the medicine or taking the necessary foodstuffs. But if he doesn't force himself, then he can't get out of that diseased condition.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that condition is finished. I have no stamina to force.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You won't let us help you to have that stamina?

**Prabhupāda:**
How you can?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, we can sit you up physically. We can put the liquid in your mouth. All you have to do is agree to it. Physically it's not... It's not physically so difficult. The main question is the willingness.

**Prabhupāda:**
But when one's physical strength...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
When one's physical strength... You...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think it would be possible for you to get better, Śrīla Prabhupāda. But I...

**Bhavānanda:**
Everyone says, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that liver is good, digestion is good, your heart is good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Simply you're not taking enough foodstuffs.

**Bhavānanda:**
But you won't eat.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But it's not a fact that you cannot eat, because when we gave you the enema, there was stool. Which shows that everything you ate turned into stool or was digested. The only problem was because of lack of energy or strength, you can't pass the stool out. But it's not a fact that it didn't get digested.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, please try. Śrīla Prabhupāda, your presence on this planet is the only thing which is keeping the onslaught of the Kali-yuga from really taking effect. We have no idea even what will happen if you should leave.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not in my hands. Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma want you to fight, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now I am falling.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now what?

**Prabhupāda:**
Falling.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We couldn't hear what you were saying.

**Prabhupāda:**
Falling down. Try pass urine. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The urine is getting a little darker, Śrīla Prabhupāda, again. In the last ten and a half hours you've only taken 150 cc's of any kind of drink. If you drink a lot, often, then the urine will become clear because the disease will get flushed out, plus your body will absorb some strength and you'll get the... You won't fall down. You'll get the determination to become better. The determination and strength won't come simply by laying there. It'll come as you drink more and as the disease goes away. I mean I can very easily say, "Don't make the effort. Let Kṛṣṇa do with you what..." But I think Kṛṣṇa is doing.

**Prabhupāda:**
What was the quantity of urine?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What was quantity of the urine? About 50, I think. About 50 cc's. I'm all in favor of you increasing your drinking and eating. I know it may be a little difficult. It may be a little difficult, but that's the proper way to get better.

**Bhavānanda:**
Yesterday you took over 600.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Seven hundred.

**Bhavānanda:**
And this morning at 5:30 your urine was practically all clear.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I mean we have to go on some basis, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And from the... What we can see, we can see. Whatever you ate turned into stool. Now, that is a good sign. That's a good sign. If it didn't come out of its own accord, that's due to less strength. And by drinking a lot yesterday, this morning the urine becomes clear, and by taking those medicines. These are actual, factual things we can observe. One thing is, you don't feel able to sleep. That's a bad thing. And the other thing is your being so weak condition that your willpower is weakened. Your determination is weakened. So, so far as those two problems go, for sleeping I know that something can be given to help you to sleep. So far willpower, if you allow us to take care of you, then I think that should be the willpower. Of course, I mean we're not going to let them do anything bad. I mean I'm not going to let anybody take you to the hospital. I wouldn't have done it in London, except that you yourself said we should do it. Otherwise your instruction's told to everybody, "Don't let them take me to a hospital." So we're not thinking like that. Neither I'm going to let anybody put any..., take any blood specimen, any of those things. It's not required. These things which they're giving you will not... The only harmful effect is that you cannot sleep. But that can be given. To help you sleep can be helped. Otherwise this //kavirājī// medicine, it may be less agitating to take, but does it actually work? Now for nearly half a day you have drank only one time a little bit. But you want us to take care of you and help you, then I think you should accept these... I mean they're very reasonable arguments.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the //Gītā,// in one purport you say in the beginning when you undergo treatment, even when you're jaundiced the sugar candy is very bitter. These slight side effects are bitter for you, but if you keep taking the treatment, we know that that will eventually clear up.

**Prabhupāda:**
This light massage he is doing...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
...it is giving me comfort.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Light massage.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Bhakti-caru:**
You want it now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This massage you were doing is good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dr. Ghosh said no massage. The other doctor says, "No, what is the harm?"

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Which one? The...

**Bhavānanda:**
Dr. Gopal.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One thing that we have seen is that when Dr. Ghosh and Dr. Gopal talk, they disagree on a number of points. Someone pointed out that Dr. Ghosh is a little bit old-fashioned. He's not so much up-to-date any more. He's eighty-two years old. Just like he gave recommendation for when you wash your mouth, using hydrogen peroxide. Now, Dr. Gopal stated hydrogen peroxide is very cleansing, but nowadays they make things which are not so strong and without harmful effects of hydrogen peroxide. But because Dr. Ghosh is a little old-fashioned, he's not aware so much of these things.

**Prabhupāda:**
So? They disagree?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Bhakti-caru:**
They disagree.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, on some points they do.

**Prabhupāda:**
So which is correct?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Which is correct? Well, it's obviously a fact... I mean anybody who's gargled with hydrogen peroxide knows that it can be..., it's very strong. That's the point. It's very strong. In your condition, it's very strong.

**Hari-śauri:**
It's a risk...

**Bhavānanda:**
Dr. Gopal, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he recommended this medicine, and you took this medicine yesterday. And he recommended increase the liquids...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These are all Dr. Gopal's...

**Bhavānanda:**
...and this morning you had clear urine. So...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is not Dr. Ghosh's prescriptions. These are Dr. Gopal's prescriptions. When they went in the other room after seeing you, these were all recommended by Dr. Gopal.

**Bhavānanda:**
And he also was able to analyze your inability to eat and drink as a result of this poisoning from the kidney infection. So he was able to diagnose fairly accurately.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think, from everybody's point of view, this Dr. Gopal, factually speaking, seemed more up-to-date and able to diagnose correctly according to allopathic standards than Dr. Ghosh. Dr. Ghosh... After all, this allopathic medicine is still a developing science. So Dr. Ghosh's knowledge of it cannot be as up-to-date as someone who's younger.

**Bhavānanda:**
Dr. Ghosh was insistent, he wanted you to take Lassix. And Dr. Gopal said, "No, no. Lassix is too strong. There is a new dialysis medicine, very, very, very gentle and mild," he said

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But Dr. Ghosh never heard of it. I think Dr. Ghosh's value is that he's willing to stay here and attend to you. But I think that Dr. Gopal is better to...

**Abhirāma:**
They both agreed on it was the same disease.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. They agree that the disease is the same. They understand what the disease is, and they both agree on that. But as to treatment, Dr. Gopal seems to be more aware of the more modern and up-to-date discoveries that science has made than Dr. Ghosh. Dr. Ghosh is aware, more or less, of things which were available ten or twenty years ago.

**Bhavānanda:**
We can go and see Dr. Gopal this morning.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhagatjī said Dr. Gopal is his close friend. He can bring him here once a day if necessary.

**Bhavānanda:**
And explain to him that you've had some restless reaction to this medicine and get his opinion and new diagnosis, new medicines, if necessary. And for your liquid intake, if you can take just four glasses of Complan in one day, plus some juice now and then, it won't be so much, so many times you'll have to be bothered. They all recommended that Complan is the very best.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? What?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Complan, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's a drink, beverage, like Horlicks. I gave it to you last night.

**Bhavānanda:**
Is there some bad effect to it that you feel, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you take that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not yet, but when it becomes mucus.

**Bhakti-caru:**
That's not milk, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Hari-śauri:**
Complan is milk-based. [whispering with others] At least there doesn't seem to be any mucus this morning, and this is a full day now since you took that //chānā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
The //chānā// was nothing. So? What do you want to do now?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Should we make you some Complan now, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and some //chānā?//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We've been giving him Complan for a month. Four times a day is too much.

**Bhakti-caru:**
No. In the morning with some warm drink.

**Prabhupāda:**
You give me Complan.

**Bhakti-caru:**
And little //chānā,// Śrīla Prabhupāda? Like yesterday? Okay.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You'll take //chānā// after bathing, washing face, and...? That's when you took it yesterday. Every one of us is in agreement. All of your disciples are in agreement that you require to force yourself to eat and drink more. What can we do if you don't...

**Prabhupāda:**
When I don't take anything, I feel more comfortable.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But you don't get better. That is the policy of death.

**Prabhupāda:**
So let me die peacefully.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But we already explained to you that we don't want you to die.

**Prabhupāda:**
But if I become discomfortable, that will be...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But that's only temporary, this discomfort. It's only temporarily until one gets better. Medicine is only required until one gets better. Then he can throw out the medicines.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Ahhh! //Jaya// Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. Now I am feeling don't force.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now that he's not eating or drinking anything and no medicines is...

**Bhavānanda:**
But your urine is cloudy again.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever it may be... If you leave me to my fate, I'll feel comfortable.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He said, "If you leave me to my fate, then I feel comfortable. But if you force me, then I feel uncomfortable." Is that right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
But the other day you said that to fast like this means suicide.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I asked you the other night if you would fast, that you should not fast until death. And you said, "No, no. That is suicidal."

**Prabhupāda:**
Now I am puzzled.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Puzzled.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Puzzled. I mean, we are not able to let you go, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We are not strong enough. We want you to be with us. We need you longer.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway, what can be done? You give me that preparation?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Complan.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Bhakti-caru is preparing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Girirāja?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Girirāja? You want to see him?

**Prabhupāda:**
Where he is?

**Brahmānanda:**
He's here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Probably at //ārati, guru-pūjā.// Now there's a class. Should we call him?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's here in Vṛndāvana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who has sent the conveyance?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Mr. B. N. Patodiya.

**Prabhupāda:**
To whom?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
To you, care of Panchashil flat. Actually, I have to look at the envelope. I think actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it was sent... I'll just check.

**Prabhupāda:**
I wanted to speak to you all. Therefore I was asking Girirāja.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You wanted to speak to who?

**Prabhupāda:**
To you all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Shall we call Girirāja? The conveyance was sent to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, here in Vṛndāvana.

**Prabhupāda:**
You had to take care. But if by Kṛṣṇa's desire I do not exist during Bombay opening ceremony, then the ceremony should be very gorgeously performed, and everyone should be given sumptuous //prasādam,// whoever comes. Of course, the opening ceremony should be performed as early as possible.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here is Girirāja now, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Girirāja?

**Prabhupāda:**
You repeat what I have...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda said that if he does not exist till the Bombay opening, then it should be performed very gorgeously, and everyone should be fed sumptuous //prasādam,// and it should be celebrated as early as possible.

**Prabhupāda:**
And one thing... Just now I am forgetting. And don't try to make preparation in the temple. Order the foodstuff from confectioner. Have good stock and distribute.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All of the //prasādam,// or just sweets?

**Prabhupāda:**
Sweets. There are many nice sweet supplier in Bombay. Order them... [break] How do you like this idea?

**Girirāja:**
It's very good idea, except that we feel that you should personally be present.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Kṛṣṇa's desire. You are trying. I am also trying. Now it is Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma's desire.

**Bhagavān:**
You are the jewel that will make it all gorgeous, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I am giving the idea. Ha. Haaa!

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The Complan is here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what shall I do?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sit up and drink.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Hmm. Hare Kṛṣṇa //kīrtana.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Kīrtana?// Do you want some //kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Soft //kīrtana.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...thakur re.//[?] I want association of Vaiṣṇava. You are all pure Vaiṣṇavas. You have sacrificed everything, material comforts, for Kṛṣṇa's sake. That is Vaiṣṇava. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. You have no other desire. You Europeans, Americans, you are born amongst material desires. And when you become free from material desires... Therefore you are all Vaiṣṇava, //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. So you are so merciful. Where Tamāla gone?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'm here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, you are taking care of that conveyance?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, we are, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Jayapatākā:**
Because you are a //paramahaṁsa,// Śrīla Prabhupāda, you are seeing everyone else as surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. But only by your mercy, you are forcing us to serve Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. One Bengali gentleman has come from New York?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Mr. Sukamal Roy Chowdury.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I have deputed some of you to initiate. Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Actually... Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I think Jayapatākā can do that if he likes. I have already deputed. Tell him.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, deputies, Jayapatākā's name was there?

**Bhagavān:**
It is already on there, Śrīla Prabhupāda. His name was on that list.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I depute him to do this at Māyāpur, and you may go with him. I stop for the time being. Is that all right?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Stopped doing what, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
This initiation. I have deputed the..., my disciples. Is it clear or not?

**Girirāja:**
It's clear.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got the list of the names?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
And if by Kṛṣṇa's grace I recover from this condition, then I shall begin again, or I may not be pressed in this condition to initiate. It is not good.

**Girirāja:**
We will explain to him so that he will understand properly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Hmm? [whispering between devotees]

**Girirāja:**
We will explain to him so he will understand, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Girirāja:**
I said we will explain to the Bengali gentleman just as you have described to us, so that he'll be satisfied with this arrangement. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
And Dr. Ghosh has his scheme, but actually the scheme is there in the //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// We want to introduce that scheme to our //gurukula.// We haven't got to manufacture scheme. Is that correct?

**Girirāja:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let them learn to rise early in the morning and cleanse. This is the first scheme. This will keep their health nice. //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. Unless in the human society the //varṇāśrama// system is introduced, no scheme or social order, health order or any order, political order, will be successful.

**Bhagavān:**
Everything is there very clearly in your books, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
A man-made scheme---useless. //Sāttvika-guṇa.//[?] What is that verse? //Sattvāvalambi-para-sattva-viśuddha-sattvam...// From //Brahma-saṁhitā?//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Which verse, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sattvāvalambi-para-sattva-viśuddha-sattvam.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Māyā hi yasya jagad-aṇḍa-śatāni sūte// [Bs. 5.41]?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Traiguṇya-tad-viṣaya-veda-vitāyamānā, sattvāvalambi-para-sattva-viśuddha-sattvaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Māyā hi yasya...//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jagad-aṇḍa-śatāni...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śatāni sūte.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Traiguṇya-tad...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Traiguṇya-tad-viṣaya-veda-vitāyamānā.// The //māyā, māyā hi yasya jagad-aṇḍa-śatāni sūte// [Bs. 5.41]. Hundreds of universes. //Māyā hi yasya jagad-aṇḍa-śatāni sūte traiguṇya.// This is made of three //guṇas.// And Bhagavān, //sattvāvalambi-para-sattva-viśuddha-sattvam.// In that existence there is no material contamination. [pause] The Bengal government for Panihati, what is their decision?

**Jayapatākā:**
At Panihati they have asked us to rewrite a letter. We have already written a letter to the chairman of the Municipality. And they are going to take up the matter. After our first application, then the governments have changed. And the Municipality was previously managed by a government administrator. Now the government administrator has been removed, and they have replaced the municipal commissioners. So the chairman of the Municipality, he requested us to write a letter, and he will follow up the matter. Bhakti-caru Swami and Sarvabhāvana dāsa met him. They said that he was favorably disposed, but he was not aware of the matter. So since then we have given him a letter. It will take some time to get a reply.

**Prabhupāda:**
The government changes and everything changes.

**Jayapatākā:**
In India things are very unstable. Government changes and everything is in the air for some time. The local people of Panihati were very eager to have it developed, so it should not be difficult. They have repeatedly requested you... When there is public desire...

**Prabhupāda:**
But unless we get authority...

**Jayapatākā:**
We'll get the clear title. Otherwise we won't do anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
We have to invent some word for... Act very cautiously. Who are present here now?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Girirāja dāsa, Jayapatākā Swami, Bhavānanda Goswami, Hari-śauri Prabhu, Bhagavān Prabhu and myself. We are all sitting around you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, if you want, you can give me little fruit juice. Will that satisfy you? Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Girirāja:**
"Are you satisfied?"

**Prabhupāda:**
I have taken that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Complan.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. If I take a little fruit juice.

**Bhagavān:**
Yes, that is very nice, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda said are you satisfied if he takes some fruit juice.

**Bhavānanda:**
Oh, yes, yes. And, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if you could just take a little of that medicine. I spoke to Dr. Ghosh, and he said that we'll cut down the amount of the medicine. Bhakti-caru has made it up. Just take a moment to take, and then we can take with the fruit juice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that fruit juice fresh?

**Bhavānanda:**
They say yes, it's fresh now. Grape juice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You want to be covered, Śrīla Prabhupāda? You want to have some covering? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...the massage is giving me relief. [sound of mosquito flying]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We are applying it with love, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
The mosquitoes, they are warning.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Don't worry. They won't get you while we're near. The mass... The professional massage man, he massages with oil, and we are massaging with love.

**Prabhupāda:**
That oil creates some ant.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. The ants are attracted by its sweetness. But we are only hoping to attract you by the sweetness of our massage. No ants will come. [break]

**Bhagavān:**
Your juice is here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Would you like to sit up? [pause] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...softly and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...mind, //niveśaya,// fix up in Kṛṣṇa. This is Rūpa Gosvāmī method. //Yena tena prakāreṇa manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet// [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.4]. So you are already attached to Kṛṣṇa. You'll see the picture and enjoy. So you can give this picture to him, his own.

**Haṁsadūta:**
We'll put it in his room [referring to Dr. G. Ghosh]. [end]
