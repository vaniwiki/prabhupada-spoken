[Very Poor Recording]

**Prabhupāda:**
So you purchased[?] ...

**Dr. Gopal:**
Except weakness, you do have more?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Except for weakness do you have any other complaints, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No desire for eating.

**Dr. Gopal:**
Is there any cough?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hm?

**Dr. Gopal:**
Is there any cough?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, no cough.

**Dr. Gopal:**
Mucus?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Mucus? No, no. Is there any mucus?..

**Prabhupāda:**
Purified.

**Dr. Gopal:**
No mucus, just some symptoms. Did you have much motion today, yesterday?

**Prabhupāda:**
I think..

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda he is trying to tell Dr. Gopal that you have moved your bowels ...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm.

**Bhavānanda:**
[Indistinct]

**Dr. Gopal:**
I see, if your bowels are moving very well these days [indistinct] so that .. [indistinct] problem [indistinct] ......... [pause -3:34] .. the amount of urine ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
.. [indistinct] the amount of liquid intake [indistinct] ....

**Dr. Gopal:**
[indistinct] .. the amount of urine, if it is more than 700 .. he will suffer ..

**Bhavānanda:**
.. more than 700? ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So how much does [indistinct] usually have 700cc’s

**Dr. Gopal:**
[indistinct] ..I will find out and in that way I’ll know better [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
400

**Dr. Gopal:**
400, hm. Could you pass me [indistinct] or more [indistinct].. This is the clear [indistinct] or [indistinct]..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How is the color today?

**Bhavānanda:**
Slightly cloudy..

**Dr. Gopal:**
Slightly cloudy but not much cloudy because ahm, much improvement ..

**Bhavānanda:**
Much improvement, much improvement!

**Dr. Gopal:**
I think that I [indistinct] .. I say ..that eh, this is [indistinct]..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Did you hear any of that Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**All:**
[laugh]

**Prabhupāda:**
Very enjoyable[?]

**Dr. Gopal:**
Because I want that ah, you are feeling at the moment a few [indistinct] I was maybe wrong but afterwards I suppose [indistinct] you have not oral food so that [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[indistinct]

**Dr. Gopal:**
Best [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hm.

**Dr. Gopal:**
And eh, simply taking a [indistinct] give him some [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[indistinct]

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, [indistinct] with all of the juice we have been putting [indistinct]. Śrīla Prabhupāda doctor Gopal ...

**Dr. Gopal:**
I am of the opinion that don’t [indistinct] affects mucus [indistinct] glucose. You don’t want to give sugar because by giving him glucose it will cause more gas organization.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda asks what about Misthi? [?]

**Bhavānanda:**
Misthi dahi[?]

**Dr. Gopal:**
This is very good [indistinct] but it can harm, the sugar can harm. Ordinary sugar can harm because the sugar has glucose.

**Prabhupāda:**
Misthi water, I want.

**Dr. Gopal:**
Misthi water [indistinct].

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda we have spoken with doctor Gopal he also like all of the other doctors and like yourself and all of your disciples. He says that you should take milk, however he has suggested that you take ice cream and ice cold milk. He said that will include cream, he said, Dr. Gopal said that will ... that will reduce the nausia..

**Dr. Gopal:**
By taking these 4 things you will not have this feeling of nausia, vomiting and mucus if you had [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm. I’m taking ...

**Dr. Gopal:**
And secondly don’t take much of [fruit] juices [indistinct]

. .. because it will [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about eh..

**Others:**
Pommegranate ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Pommegranate?

**Dr. Gopal:**
Pommegranate, this you can give.

**Bhavānanda:**
But no mozante[?] or sweet, lemon and citrus.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about sweet wine?

**Dr. Gopal:**
[indistinct] at the moment we are trying to utilize for the..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about grape juice?

**Dr. Gopal:**
Grape juice?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Grape juice is alright and pomegranate juice is alright.

**Bhavānanda:**
Dr. Gopal, what about mucus which...

**Dr. Gopal:**
Mucus [indistinct] .. for one who is rendered diseased mucus is [indistinct] and one who is [indistinct]is coming from the bowel because a bowel the function one of the functions is to form mucus, so that as other parts of the body. The eyes [indistinct] the mouth parallel whether the function moves properly, the urine for example [indistinct] there should not be any [indistinct] in the same way the bowels [indistinct] it is something which creates mucus. So that the mucus is coming normally without any [indistinct].

**Bhavānanda:**
Call you.

**Dr. Gopal:**
Secondly, [indistinct] but I have already [indistinct] .. I think though the cough must be less than you were telling me 2 or 3 days back?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You're not getting much cough now Śrīla Prabhupāda, the doctor says it's because of the syrup he is giving..

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] just the immediate result of giving milk and some syrop...[indistinct] cough ..

**Dr. Gopal:**
That is you can have a gargle... I told you on that day also that you can have Listerine gargles .. Listerine you can have put in a cup of water and he can have gargles with that and rinse the mouth...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah we can give that with water?

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] Prabhupāda said that after bath [indistinct] and after one hour [indistinct] mucus ..

**Dr. Gopal:**
That's right, I said on that day also that he can have a plain steamed inhalation but I think that the steam [indistinct] ... and whatever cough and mucus is there ... without any aversion..

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Dr. Gopal:**
[indistinct] the cause is mucus [indistinct] when he will have steamed inhalation then it will come out very easily [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, and if he does get cough again the easiest way to get it out very easily is the steamed inhalation...

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Dr. Gopal:**
[indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda likes that..

**Bhavānanda:**
And the restlessness?

**Dr. Gopal:**
Restlessness, I think...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about that restlessness at night?

**Dr. Gopal:**
He is very much restless?

**Bhavānanda:**
It comes at night, during the day he is always able to rest but in the evening..

**Dr. Gopal:**
At the moment he has only got a little amount of blood as far as I know.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda, may be you're not sleeping at night because you always used to stay up and translate.

**Devotees:**
[laugh]

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He was never sleeping at night maybe he still remembers that.

**Dr. Gopal:**
I see, I don't want to be... [indistinct discussion follows with TKG] ...

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhavānanda?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda

**Prabhupāda:**
Did you get the //kavirāja// [indistinct] medicine..

**Bhavānanda:**
No, Śrīla Prabhupāda [indistinct] ..

[indistinct discussion follows]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, no ... That was eight months ago..

**Dr. Gopal:**
.. Only a drop of blood, not much ...

[indistinct discussion follows then long pause as the doctor is doing something]

**Bhavānanda:**
How many times do you do this?

[indistinct discussion follows]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, the doctor says that these exercises would be good for getting the muscles more stronger... [indistinct] ..

**Bhavānanda:**
If you don't do some little exercise like this then how will you be able to walk for //darśan// of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma? [laughs]

[indistinct discussion follows]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Rādhā-Rāsabihārī //ārtik,// separation...

**All:**
[laugh]

[indistinct discussion follows] [27.04]

**Bhavānanda:**
Dr. Gopal [indistinct] good for itching back ..

**Dr. Gopal:**
For that you can apply...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Poltice[?] [indistinct discussion follows]

**Dr. Gopal:**
.. and this gargling helps the bowels [indistinct] .. [indistinct discussion follows]

**Bhavānanda:**
And are there any other solid foods that you would recommend that he should take?

**Dr. Gopal:**
[indistinct] .. [indistinct discussion follows]

**Bhavānanda:**
Still, Dr. Gopal Prabhupāda becomes as Tamāla[?] explained Prabhupāda has to take...[indistinct]..

**Dr. Gopal:**
[indistinct] still more .. liver ...

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, Dr Gopal says that because you are only taking liquid therefore it is causing some nausea and if you take some solid like this dalia[?] Or a chapati soaked in milk...

**Dr. Gopal:**
Can he take potatoes?

**Others:**
Yes. Oh yes.

**Dr. Gopal:**
Cooked potatoes, mashed potatoes. [indistinct discussion follows] .. I don't like fried things ..

**Prabhupāda:**
Boiled?

**Dr. Gopal:**
Ah, boiled or mashed. ... [indistinct] .. or boiled potatoes.

**Bhavānanda:**
[Indistinct, laughs] and ice cream, ice cream and ice cold milk. Ice cold Complan..

**Dr. Gopal:**
Complan or..

**Bhavānanda:**
All cold...

**Dr. Gopal:**
Put in it ... [indistinct] ..

**Bhavānanda:**
.. for reducing, that will be, mucus will be reduced. If this is applied, is that correct? What is the purpose of taking it cold?

**Dr. Gopal:**
... [indistinct] ..cold ... [indistinct] .. any more questions?

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, do you have any questions or anything you would like to know from Dr Gopal? ...

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think he may have gotten something for getting mucus cold ... [indistinct] ..

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dr. Ghosh[?] ..

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That is a good idea.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well first of all, Dr Ghosh has not yet established his dispensary so he wont be able to give any help to anybody until he gets his dispensary setup. And the second point is that for common colds and other things this kavirāja seems to be very expert. But your condition is not a simple cold. In fact we have tried to use this kavirāja for a six months, five months. To no avail. So when someone has a cold, then maybe it is kavirāja who can manage to work in very difficult cases. Not that, it doesn't seem to be very effective. In any case if Dr. Ghosh would set up his dispensary as an institute then I don't think anyone would want to go to the kavirāja. Because as Westerners we have found that the allopathic medicines act a little bit more quickly and very often the Ayurvedic medicines, they are not potent enough, or they are not prescribed properly and they don't work always very properly...Em, this change of the weather suddenly. Warm in the day and cold at night a couple of the devotees have caught a little cold. In any case for a difficult case, then Dr Gopal is there.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, he could but they have chosen to go through the kavirāja. I don't know why because if I had a cold I would go to Dr Gopal. I wouldn't waste my time going through the kavirāja. Because I've seen that in dealing with you. Although I would like to learn much and he seems like a nice devotee. I haven't seen any improvement in his condition and he has been... not even I got any improvement when I went for that [indistinct] in Calcutta. Simply I got my money taken. But at least with this Dr Gopal, so far we notice that nothing very bad is happening and in fact if anything you are able to increase your intake of foodstuffs. Well about four or five days ago you were taking about the equal of one glass or cup of liquid. Now you're taking the equivalent of about 4 cups. You’ve increased by four times what you were taking previously.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually Śrīla Prabhupāda, everyone passes stool every day. In fact, I was thinking...

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I was thinking that because you were not passing stool for so many months properly. Maybe once every five days for a day. So you became accustomed to passing school in a regular way, natural way. I don't think that we should take it that this is such a serious difficulty. It might be a slight inconvenience but that will be passed over. When you're, just like. Just like anything that when done, there must be ways with the good effects and the bad effects. So in some things there may be some slight bad effect. Just like a botheration but if one gets cured then that is the main thing. So we are trying to see how to cure you and if in doing so you may pass a little extra stool. That should not be taken as so important that it does away with the cure.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The kavirāja's medicine it stopped passing stool?

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't think [indistinct] .. as far as I know, people were going to the kavirāja for the purpose of their own needs. Bhavānanda Mahārāja sometimes gets a little congestion due to the air here and Girirāja had a cold...

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] Bombay ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, he will be going back in about a few days time.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, actually we have all been discussing. When I just walked in the room Pañcadraviḍa Mahārāja was making as .. He was looking a little better today. And actually [indistinct] .. as you yourself said, "at least I am not feeling any worse or weaker." Is that fact still [indistinct] ..

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda said, "What is weaker than a dead body?"...

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually though your ... [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It is the sign of a great Yogi.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, we should add some ah, flesh to the bone. And the way to do that is by taking regularly some nourishing drink. Then you wont be bones anymore.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If you take something solid then the stool business will stop. Anyone here who drinks only liquids will pass stool all the time, anyone. That is natural. But if you take a little bit of something solid, or binding then you won't pass stool.

**Prabhupāda:**
[thick heavy cough] ... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That was Dr Gopal's reasoning. That anybody drinking liquid only, he will pass stool more. So I think you should try to take some solid.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The only things that have to be taken, Dr Gopal was discussing.

**Devotee:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well make a few things up..

**Devotee:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Smashed potato.

**Devotee:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Smash it.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In the meantime you can take a little pomegranate juice and then by the time everything gets ready we will make a few things. A little [indistinct] also would be good. And some smashed potatoes. A few things, take a little little of each. And in that way your condition will improve. Actually according to Dr Gopal you will be sitting up on your own within a few days time.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Most of them say four days, he only said two [chuckles]. Usually they say four. The kavirāja would say four. Anyway, one should think positively and always...

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That doctor Ghosh of [indistinct] said four days. But Dr Gopal is the best he says two days.. Of course that is to encourage you Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Are you doing the exercising today?

**Prabhupāda:**
... [indistinct] ..

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is described how one great devotee of Lord Caitanya he did not have any disciples. So everyone was asking him, "why you do not take any disciples?" He said, "all right the first person who I meet tomorrow I will make him my disciple." So then he went down to the Ganga for a bath in the morning and the first person he met was a dead body floating down the river. So, he was so pure that simply by touching this body, the person came back to life again and he made him his disciple. So by the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu a dead body can become alive again. So we are expecting that same thing for you Śrīla Prabhupāda. You told us that we should understand everything from your books, so it is stated in the books that it is possible. [end]
