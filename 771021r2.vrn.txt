**Prabhupāda:**
We restrict the tongue, practicing. Anything can be done by practice. So if we take //kṛṣṇa-prasādam,// the tongue is restricted, locked to some limited... Then our all other senses become controlled. And spiritual life means sense control. We are not going to kill the senses. The //yogīs,// they artificially want to stop the activities of the senses, but that is not possible. Senses are there. Life means senses. //Aprākṛta. Prākṛta,// and when senses are engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, that is //aprākṛta,// transcendental. That is described, //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. Our senses are now //upādhi//---"I am Indian," "I am American," "I am this," "I am that." Senses are there, everywhere, but it is designated. So we have to free the senses from this material designation. And when the designations are washed away, at..., with that senses, //hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.// Purified senses without any designation, when we engage in the service of Kṛṣṇa, that is called //bhakti.//

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati...
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

So senses without designation engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa is called //bhakti,// or transcendental activity. Is that clear?

**Devotees:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have given little oil? Eh?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, not so... [break] [Bengali]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Mustard. [Bengali]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali with Prabhupāda]

**Upendra:**
Your hands might have had that previous oil on them.

**Bhakti-caru:**
No, not that.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] So, you want to stop here?

**Jayādvaita:**
If you want to go on, we can go on, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I have no objection.

**Jayādvaita:**
You've been speaking so strongly just now that I was sorry that I suggested that we stop. So now I'm glad that you're continuing. Flashlight?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] //Aprākṛta,// transcendental. Whatever we discuss, that is on the transcendental platform, nothing to do with this material world. The Māyāvādī impersonalist, they cannot understand this. They think this is also material. Then? Read. You are going to read?

**Pradyumna:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There is just one more point on that verse. He says there are some verses that say //upaniṣada puruṣaḥ namo vedānta vedyāya kṛṣṇāya.// So Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa has raised a question that it says Kṛṣṇa is not seen by the //Upaniṣads,// but then there's some verses that say He is known by the //Vedas,// He is known by //Upaniṣads.// He says it is proved that the Absolute is able to be known by //Vedas, veda-gamyatvam kintu...// Then he quotes other verses. It says but //sakalyena avedatvam,// He cannot be known completely through //Vedas,// only through devotional service

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. When one is purified by Vedic knowledge, then //mad-bhaktir labhate param.// Then he is allowed entrance in devotional understanding. //Bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā// [[books:sb:1:2:12|[SB 1.2.12]]]. There is a...? Eh? In //Bhāgavatam?//

Jayādvaita: First Canto.

> tac chraddadhānā munayo
> jñāna-vairāgya-yuktayā
> paśyanty ātmani cātmānaṁ
> bhaktyā śruta-gṛhītayā
> [[books:sb:1:2:12|[SB 1.2.12]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śruta-gṛhītayā.// And //śruta-gṛhītayā// is //Vedānta// knowledge, not sentimental. //Śruta-gṛhītayā.// That is sound knowledge. Discuss //Bhāgavatam// daily, as much as possible. Everything will be clarified. Because //Bhāgavata// is the essence. //Nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam idam// [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]]. And //vyāsadeva-kṛta. Kim anyaiḥ śāstraiḥ.// When he's self-realized, he made this. //Mahā-muni-kṛte.// So the more we read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// the knowledge becomes clarified. Each and every verse---transcendental. Is this clear?

**Devotees:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Pradyumna:**
So should I read the next verse, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, how are you?

**Dayānanda:**
Very nice, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Thank you.

**Prabhupāda:**
So everything is going nice?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I brought you some fruits. Ātreya Ṛṣi told me to bring you some oranges and some lemons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you are all so kind. How is your family?

**Dayānanda:**
Very nice, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So...

**Dayānanda:**
It's very encouraging to hear that you're...

**Prabhupāda:**
Restaurant.

**Upendra:**
Restaurant.

**Dayānanda:**
Yes, it's doing very nicely, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We're getting a lot of nice...

**Prabhupāda:**
You are all happy?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes. We are also happy to hear that you're translating, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Trying. So at night there is no need of giving juice. Tomorrow. Eh?

**Upendra:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. No. Tomorrow. Fruit juice at night is not good.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. People are appreciating our Movement?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We are trying to speak to people who are more intelligent, people who are more...

**Prabhupāda:**
There are many intelligent persons, Iran. Eh? Is it not?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere dull-headed, intelligent... You are working at computer?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, what salary they gave?

**Dayānanda:**
About little over a thousand dollars in a month, about 1,200 dollars.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. So how you are spending that money?

**Dayānanda:**
I'm giving... Now I live in my own apartment, I'm giving fifty percent to the ISKCON Tehran projects, and fifty percent I keep for maintenance.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there is no scarcity? Eh?

**Dayānanda:**
No, there's no scarcity, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And in my spare time I am working in the restaurant, helping to manage the restaurant.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is a big company?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, all over the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Dayānanda:**
They have offered me a position in Russia. They said that I can go and work in Russia, but I am very much attached to Tehran project. So in companies like this we can go. I can go...

**Prabhupāda:**
Anywhere.

**Dayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the company?

**Dayānanda:**
It's a computer company. Univac, it's called. It's like IBM. It's a competitor of IBM.

**Prabhupāda:**
American? No. The company originated from America?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes, yes, American company.

**Prabhupāda:**
IBM also American, eh?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, when there is opportunity you can go for preaching. But here you are situated nice, Tehran, eh?

**Dayānanda:**
Yes. Ātreya Ṛṣi would rather have me stay. Ātreya Ṛṣi wants me to stay at least for this, for now. Maybe in the future I can go to some other place for preaching.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is good.

**Dayānanda:**
//Jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.//

**Dayānanda:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// [break]

**Girirāja:**
...says that we hadn't met anyone with so many wonderful transcendental qualities.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] This... It has to be developed. Transcendental qualities are already there. Only when we are designationless it manifests. //Svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Sevonmukhe jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ:// when we become prone to give service to Kṛṣṇa, it becomes revealed. It is already there. Nothing is imported. Now print book and distribute. In Australia they have sold all the //Gītās.// They will require more. //Jaya// Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.

//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Baradrāj, you are helping the Society in so many ways. So we are indebted to you. So Los Angeles, what is going on there?

**Baradrāj:**
Now they are...

**Prabhupāda:**
You gave me the other day plan, very nice. If you put into shape it will be wonderful.

**Baradrāj:**
By your blessings, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it can become possible.

**Prabhupāda:**
So who is looking after now?

**Baradrāj:**
Now? Ādi-deva.

**Prabhupāda:**
The room, formerly Deity room, this is now complete?

**Baradrāj:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
What has been done there?

**Baradrāj:**
It has been made into a museum, complete museum. There is twelve different exhibits. And the first exhibit is exhibit of Your Divine Grace writing books at Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, introduction. The next exhibit is Kṛṣṇa-Arjuna on the battlefield, and Kṛṣṇa begins to explain //dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]] to Arjuna. And the third exhibit is showing changing bodies, showing how the body is changing but the soul remains the same. The fourth exhibit shows the chariot of the body---the five horses, the five senses. The driver is the intelligence; the soul is the passenger. Then there is the fifth exhibit. It shows how a man can become degraded and how he can become elevated from a neutral position in life. And the sixth exhibit shows that when a man becomes elevated by Vedic wisdom he becomes //sama-darśinaḥ, paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. He sees everyone equal---dog, elephant, a cow, even //brāhmaṇa//---everyone, the same spirit soul. And he also sees Paramātmā in the heart of everyone. Then the seventh exhibit shows how Paramātmā, the original Paramātmā, is Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, and that He comes... Then different incarnations are shown. Then the eighth exhibit shows Kṛṣṇa's //viśva-rūpa,// explaining how everything is created, is maintained and is annihilated, all within the potency of the Supreme Lord. Then the ninth exhibit shows how Kṛṣṇa personally comes on Garuḍa to deliver those who are faithful from the ocean of birth and death. It shows a man struggling in the ocean, swimming, but he cannot save himself. And then Kṛṣṇa comes down on Garuḍa. The Lord Himself intervenes. In this way the man is saved. And the tenth exhibit shows the incarnation of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, how He is delivering the whole world by this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. The eleventh exhibit explains how the soul... It shows Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana surrounded by eight //gopīs// and different animals and peacocks and birds and flowers. And it explains that the soul has eternal form and that it can enjoy, that the soul enjoys in eternal loving pastimes with Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eleven.

**Baradrāj:**
Then the last exhibit is being..., it's not yet complete. It's a film. It shows Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna at the end talking, and then Kṛṣṇa says,

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

Then Kṛṣṇa asks Arjuna, "Have you heard all this with your mind at full attention, and is your doubt and illusion now dispelled, and are you prepared to act according to My instructions?" And Arjuna says, "Yes, I shall do whatever You like."

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. So it is not yet officially open.

**Baradrāj:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Baradrāj:**
Officially it is not open yet. The reason is because there's still some minor difficulties in the computer, and so everything is not... When I left, everything was not yet functioning smoothly. So, many important people have been taken through, but it is not open to the public yet. But it will be open very soon. Actually, when I left, everything had already been... The computer is now working, but there was some lights being checked out, some wiring. And as soon as that is finished, then the programming will be done. I have sent a letter back to Los Angeles, asking them to complete the programming while I'm here in Vṛndāvana, at least a temporary program. So it is not difficult to do; it is complicated to do it. And I've asked them to make a film of the exhibition and send it here so that you could see it.

**Prabhupāda:**
I cannot go there?

**Baradrāj:**
[chuckles] You can do whatever you like.

**Śatadhanya:**
After Bombay, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if you're strong enough, then we could go.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is... And who is making //khol?//

**Baradrāj:**
Soul?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Khol, khol.//

**Baradrāj:**
Oh, //khol.// Īśāna. Īśāna dāsa.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's doing nice?

**Baradrāj:**
Yes. They are producing many, and they are very, very strong.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Baradrāj:**
They are very strong, and they sound good.

**Śatadhanya:**
They say that you can throw them on the floor and they will not break.

**Baradrāj:**
Made for Kali-yuga.

**Prabhupāda:**
How many //khols// he has already prepared?

**Baradrāj:**
I don't know exactly, but I think it was close to about two hundred when I left.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where he is making?

**Baradrāj:**
Well, they are having most of the parts done outside, by outside people, professionals, and Īśāna is assembling, and he's working very hard.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is plastic?

**Baradrāj:**
Yes, completely, everything. And it can be tuned also on the spot. There is a key, and with this key you can tune it up. The heads never break, but if they happen to break, they can be immediately replaced within... They can get extra heads, and it takes about two minutes to change, to put a new head on.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm!

**Baradrāj:**
So Īśāna has worked very hard to fulfill your order, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now he's successful.

**Baradrāj:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is his wife?

**Baradrāj:**
She is in New York with the child. She is working with Yogeśvara there on children's books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Baradrāj:**
Īśāna has taken to //vānaprastha.// He is living in New Dvārakā, but he's living in a shack, in a very simple room, and living just like in Vṛndāvana. He has given up comforts.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Go on chanting. [break] ...of Rāmānuja-sampradāya, with that big, big...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Tilaka?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. He is preparing //makara-dhvaja.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What kind of //jala?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Makara-dhvaja.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Makhara dāl?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Makara-dhvaja// is a Āyurvedic medicine. So this //kavirāja// was preparing //makara-dhvaja.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that the one with musk in it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes, we have that medicine.

**Bhavānanda:**
That we have, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He has prepared it. We have it here.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, why not try it?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What did the //kavirāja// say about it?

**Bhavānanda:**
Er, I'll get Bhakti-caru.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You dreamt that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the time now?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's seven o'clock now, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yesterday you were really on fire, lecturing and translating.

**Bhavānanda:**
Bhakti-caru has gone to the kitchen to bring some... But I recall that when we went to see the //kavirāja// he said... We had showed him your urine when it was muddy, filled with pus. He said he wanted that before this medicine could be given, he wanted to see that your urine had cleared up. But he had prepared the medicine, and we have it here.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the dose?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[aside:] Do you know the dosage?

**Bhavānanda:**
Here is Bhakti-caru. Bhakti-caru? Prabhupāda had a dream last night that there was a Vaiṣṇava from the Madhva-sam...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, Rāmānuja.

**Bhavānanda:**
Rāmānuja-sampradāya, and he was preparing that medicine, the musk medicine? What is it called?

**Bhakti-caru:**
//Makara-dhvaja.//

**Bhavānanda:**
He was preparing it. So Prabhupāda has asked about that medicine the //kavirāja...// What had the //kavirāja// told us when we went and got that medicine?

**Bhakti-caru:**
He said that he didn't want to give the medicine right now because he's too weak for that. So when he gets little strength, when the weather turns a little cold, that would be applicable to him.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He says that the //kavirāja// is waiting for you to get a little stronger, and the weather should be a little colder.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, so I have some grape juice here, and a little bit of ice cream. If you could take that now it will help you become strong.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I can take. [break]

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
This is also M.D., also physician, but that is Āyurvedic and this is allopathic. The only difference is this. Both are physicians. Might not be the combination... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So he...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's not... I don't think that it's a problem. What we have to do is simply send a letter to the bank with...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, he says you do not require. He said you collect through bank. //Bās.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But just like when you collect through a bank, you first of all have to sign.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
You have to sign.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, that's what I'm trying to say. You have to give the signed certificates to the bank, and they'll make collection. But you have to sign them. So the signers are here in Vṛndāvana.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, I say the people who have to sign are here in Vṛndāvana.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
So you have got bank account here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, we can collect through the bank here. But first of all we have to get the certificates in order to sign them. That you have to explain to Prabhupāda. He's thinking that without signing...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They'll collect here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But, Prabhupāda, your sister first of all signed them. Her son collected, but she signed on the back first of all.

**Prabhupāda:**
Did the...

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Then how are we going to do it?

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
If you have already power of attorney, then I think that...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We already have power of attorney for signing any kind of..., these kind of businesses, joint power of attorney.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Mathurā, why don't you go just now? He is also going?

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
[Bengali with Prabhupāda]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
See, first you have to have the certificates. That's what I'm trying to explain to Prabhupāda. This is only an identity slip. This has to be surrendered with the certificates.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
To any post office.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
Or any bank will collect.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And they're going to want to see Prabhupāda's signature. But since Prabhupāda is not signing, then we will show them our power of attorney, yes, power of attorney, as well a copy of our notarized signatures, so that they see that these are the same people, and then we will sign on the back on behalf of Prabhupāda. And we can do it through our bank. I won't directly approach the post office. We'll do it through our bank account.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
If you have power of attorney, that will be done.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Through the bank. That's much easier.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
That's much easier. Moreover, you can ask much.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
At the post office. So you're going to Mathurā now?

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
Yes, I am going to Mathurā.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So you want to go with me to the post office there?

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
Because I have no time.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, time is short. See, Prabhupāda, I was planning to go to the post office.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
Or I can let you know everything to him about [Bengali].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. The main question's just that... And actually there is no need to...

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
But if you have power of attorney, then everything will be... But you have to collect it from bank. That would be easier.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. We will do it through the bank, not directly.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why don't you do that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's what we're doing.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is going to be due within fortnight.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
First thing that has... Prabhupāda, one thing is that this power of attorney is to Girirāja and myself. So, one thing Girirāja is doing when he---he's reaching Bombay tomorrow---is that the power of attorney doesn't show our authorized signatures. In other words, a notary has to notarize our signatures, that these are actually the signatures.

**Prabhupāda:**
This Asnani has gone?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Excuse me?

**Prabhupāda:**
Asnani already left? That...? Our lawyer friend?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Mr. Asnani executed a power of attorney to Girirāja and myself for signing on your behalf. But our specimen signatures have to be notarized. So that, Girirāja is getting done by the same notary who notarized the power of attorney. Then Girirāja is sending me that document. Soon as he gets to Bombay, he'll have it done on Monday. Then he's sending it to me. Then I'll have the copy of the power of attorney plus the copy of the notarized signatures, and these two together I'll send with a letter to the bank to send the certificates here. When the certificates come here, then I'll present them to the local bank to make collection from the post office.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
Yes, that is the...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's the system. It's going to take a little time.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
By this time it will be..., it will be matured.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I hope that... It will be matured. It may take a week or so more, because we have to send from Bombay and then to Calcutta, then it has to come back here. Even if it takes an extra week, there's no great harm, I think. We'll try to have it done by the date, but I think it may take a few extra days.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
No, even it takes more time, they will give you the tax for tax deduction. [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You can explain to Prabhupāda that the system we are doing is the correct system.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
Because we cannot sign now.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No. But you should explain to him that you agree.

**Prabhupāda:**
I can sign, but it will not be...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The same.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In any case, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we have to bring the certificates here. That's the first thing. Whether it's your signature or whether it's our signatures, the certificate has to be brought here.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
You may sign. If both of these will be given to me, that will do.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. We'll give in this plus the certificates to the bank, and they'll give us a receipt.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
The bank is [indistinct] of Prabhupāda signature.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can take the copy of the safe custody receipt and inquire into Bank of Baroda.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You want me to give him the receipt?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But then how will we be able to get the certificates out? The receipt has to be presented when you want to withdraw from a safe custody...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, give him the copy and let him explain to the bank manager that we want to check it.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
[Bengali, explaining what they plan to do]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now, if I give you this... Prabhupāda wants me to give you this, but it says here that "This memorandum will be returned to the bank when delivery of securities is required." So if I surrender this memorandum now, then I... Prabhupāda wants me to give you this memorandum. My point is that if I give you the memorandum, then it's...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, he can take a copy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
A copy.

**Prabhupāda:**
And inquire.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I can give him the details.

**Viśvambhara[?]:**
Yes. Details I have already understand.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I can give you the details and the number, account number. You can make a specific inquiry. The main thing is just to inform them of the fact that there's a power of attorney coming, with a notarized specimen signatures are coming, and there will be a letter of direction with those two signatures, directing them to send the certificates by registered mail here, because Prabhupāda can't sign the same signature. That's basically all you have to do.

Viśvambhara[?]: [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This bank has already accepted one copy. [indistinct] Either way... [indistinct] [break] Śrīla Prabhupāda? Gopāla Kṛṣṇa is here. He just returned from Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
What news?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda said, "What news?"

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I have a new Hindi //Back to Godhead// for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I had met the Home Minister about two months ago regarding permanent residency visas.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I got a letter from the Home Minister's secretary, saying that they're considering it very seriously, and he just asked me for some more information. And actually the answers to all the questions that they have asked are positive. In other words, they have asked questions like "For these foreign students, will ISKCON pay for their boarding and lodging? How many years' course is it?" So it appears... I'm going to see them again next week. We may get our permanent residency visas. This is the first positive sign.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have made some inquiry.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. I met the Home Minister two months ago, and I gave him an application. So that was the reply. I've just received a reply.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is it for permanent residency? Not for two or three years. Permanent.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Even if they give for five years, that'd be good. So this would be very nice, because you always wanted this.

**Prabhupāda:**
So do it carefully.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. We just printed twenty thousand copies of a new Hindi //Back to Godhead.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Send to Fiji immediately.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. I got a very nice letter from Vāsudeva. Every ship that goes to Fiji, we automatically send them books. Even if there is no order, we automatically send them. So they have a stock of Hindi books.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hari-śauri has finished distributing all the //Gītās// that you sent. They already ran out.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Another ship just left. Well, I sent as much as he had ordered.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They exhausted their stock.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's good. Also, this is the biggest woman's magazine in India, //Eve's Weekly.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This... I have with me a copy of the biggest woman's magazine in India, called //Eve's Weekly.// And on the third page of that //Eve's Weekly// your advertisement for your //Gītā// is there. I mean, we didn't pay for it; our distributors are paying for it. But these ads are working very, very well.

[background whispering]

**Prabhupāda:**
No Hindi book?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Er, the Hindi 2.1 is being composed. There was a little slowdown in big Hindi books because Prem Yogi had left us for about two months. But we have reprinted all the small Hindi books again, like //Beyond Birth and Death, Perfection of Yoga.// They were all sold out.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many copies?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So we have reprinted ten thousand copies each. The reprint is going to be ready tomorrow. And we just, two weeks ago, we reprinted the //Scientific Basis of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness,// which I gave you a week ago, and now we just got this Hindi //Back to Godhead.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many copies of this?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Twenty thousand. Hindi //Back to Godhead// we are producing every second month now, twenty thousand copies.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Different issues?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Every second month a new //Back to Godhead.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's nice this time.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And the Hindi //Gītā// is being composed. It will be ready by middle December, the latest. And also the Hindi //Kṛṣṇa// book is being composed, plus we have eight books in Gujarati which are in various stages of production. And the Tamil //Gītā// is being composed and printed, and we're doing a //Gītā// in Kanarese language, and also a //Back to Godhead// in Kanarese.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that enough stock? Ten thousand? Doesn't seem like a very big printing. Jayapatākā came there. His van came there, and they couldn't get any books.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, they were out of stock... They didn't have that much when they leave.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It may happen again.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, but now we have reprinted many new titles. In total we have fifty thousand books.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's not much. You have so much distribution. [indistinct background discussion about quantities of books]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Plus we are starting to construct a BBT godown. Surabhi Swami is working on that, because now we are printing so many books, and also we have a big shipment of books from America that we definitely need a very huge godown in Bombay. Last time you had approved, given a loan of four //lakhs// for the godown.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, three //lakhs.// One //lakh// for printing, three //lakhs// for the godown.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[softly] No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. You said that the godown would only cost three //lakhs.//

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Three to four is the estimate. I mean, we don't have an exact. [to Prabhupāda:] So we are going to start work on the godown in November.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, that's nice. Now, as soon as our six Gujarati books are ready, we are starting this mail order campaign even for Gujarati books and for Hindi books. Actually, by this mail order technique we will sell more books than we sell on the streets or in colleges. Just in two months I sold more //Gītās...//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Over a thousand..., than we did in two years of library party. And I'm expanding this to...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No. They sell more. They have more than that, standing orders.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What I'm saying it's very good. A thousand //Gītās// in two months is very good. Now I'm expanding this to the //Bhāgavatam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Unless you have good godown, it will be stolen and sold in the market at cheap price.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. A good godown is very, very necessary, so we're starting work on it right away. And in three to four months it will be completed.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Can you turn onto your back again so I can do your other leg and your arms?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. You can turn me any way. Deal with the Home Minister's letter very carefully.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Deal with the Home Minister's letter very carefully.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Actually, the first meeting I had with him was very, very nice, by your grace. He took great interest. He called me for one minute, and he sat down for twenty minutes with me. So... Now, actually, it is his secretary who is handling it. The big thing is getting his approval, which we already have. Now we are dealing with the secretary in the Ministry of Home Affairs.

**Prabhupāda:**
A set of books Hindi may be taken there to the secretary.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
To the Home Minister?

**Prabhupāda:**
To the secretary.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The secretary.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. I gave your Hindi //Bhāgavatam// to the Home Minister. I think we'll give it to the secretary also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? This //kīrtana// that's in the temple, can you hear it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I wanted to know whether... The person who's singing is Śveta-varāha from Māyāpur. In Māyāpur they use a small microphone, not for the drums but for his voice, and he has a very sweet voice. So normally we don't use mic at all, but sometimes the devotees don't know how to sing very sweetly. Whether we should use a small microphone for his voice?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can try it, and if it's not nice we can stop it.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is going on without microphone?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The drums are... Right now the drumming is very loud.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But the voice is hard to hear. Should I try a little microphone? I can take it off immediately if it's not good. I think you'll...

**Bhavānanda:**
Last year in Māyāpur, Śrīla Prabhupāda, during the festival and before when you were there, they would, this //kīrtana// group of your disciples, they would be chanting over microphone so that Your Divine Grace could hear it in your room. I remember you commented many times on how sweet and nice it sounded.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is already very loud.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's very loud actually. [indistinct whispering] All the devotees were very happy when they heard that you have started translating again.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yesterday Prabhupāda translated for nearly two hours. The edited work, Śrīla Prabhupāda, sounds very beautiful. It's very first class when it's finally edited. The whole staff is here, and it sounds very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
In the horoscope we have dragged the life through so many catastrophes, but ultimately how long the life we have dragged?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
As far as I recall... I mean, each... The horoscope is written in such a way that if you survive these catastrophes, then it mentions that... He said that you would live for another five or six years.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, there are different horoscopes. One... I can show you that some of them say that you will live for more than five or six years. One of them said you could live up to one hundred.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there is no...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not standard.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, according to this man, your life should have been over at the age of seventy-five. In other words, when someone is a pure devotee, then he is not conditioned by the laws of birth and death. For people who are conditioned, there is standard. But in your case they cannot... They admit openly that there's no question of material standard. They can simply tell you... According to your birthday they can predict which days will be difficult for you because of the position of the planets. But so far as your ability to conquer over these difficulties and to live, that they completely accept is completely within Kṛṣṇa's hands, that you're not bounded by the material energy.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Karmāṇi nirdahati.//

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What's that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām// [Bs. 5.54].

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway, do things very carefully. I am already dead. But still, I am giving you instruction as far as I can. And this is not life, [chuckles] a bundle of bones.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You are still the inspiration for everything we do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That I shall go on till the last breathing. Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
[loud] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [laughter] [end]
