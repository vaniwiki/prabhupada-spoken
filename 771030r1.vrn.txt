No. We were vagabonds. We were loitering in the street, and you invited us into your home. That's actually a fact. You fed us //prasādam,// cooked for us. You taught us how to be human beings.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
Just like these //gurukula// kids. You have also taught us even how to dress ourself.

**Jayādvaita:**
And you brought us to Vṛndāvana, richest place.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
Full of desire trees and jewels.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can provide five hundred students very easily.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Such a nice building. Who would not like to go to school here in Vṛndāvana? Nice, pure atmosphere. [break]

There's a little swelling today here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, around the eye. And the hands are kind of swollen.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda and Bhakti-caru]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What's that, Bhakti-caru?

**Prabhupāda:**
If he likes, he can come.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. We don't have to invite him to come. He knows you're here. So he should come of his own accord if he wants. Okay.
