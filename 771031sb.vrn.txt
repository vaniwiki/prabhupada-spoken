**Prabhupāda:**
...for one year stolen and hidden, but they could not understand that for one year He remained like that. [break] ...naturally sleeping. "As You were not here, we could not eat. Now You have come, let us take tiffin." [indistinct] that "For one year You are absent," and now they are speaking that "You were not here; we could not eat." [break]

**Pradyumna:**
//...suta...// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...returned home. [break] ...the sitting place of //ajagara// skin was spoken to Nanda Mahārāja that Kṛṣṇa has killed this //ajagara.// What is called? Python?

**Devotees:**
Python.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [break] One year late, still you have taken as continuous. [break] Kṛṣṇa expanded as everything; therefore their affection increased. Now this chapter is ended after describing how their affection was overflowed on account of Kṛṣṇa's expansions. [break] Everyone has got affection for Kṛṣṇa, Paramātmā. [break] Hmm.

**Pradyumna:**
Number one.

**Prabhupāda:**
Summary?

**Pradyumna:**
Summary finished. Is finished chapter summary. [break] He begins to describe Lord Kṛṣṇa. He does not begin to praise at first, but just to describe Kṛṣṇa's form.

**Prabhupāda:**
And [indistinct]? [break]

**Pradyumna:**
...began to speak: "O my Lord, who alone of all living entities are worthy to be praised," //iḍiyā.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now become the son of Nanda Mahārāja. Hmm? [break]

**Pradyumna:**
"Your body is just like the color of a raincloud, of a bluish raincloud, and Your dress is just like the lightning."

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Pradyumna:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Description of the body, description of the hair. Hmm.

**Pradyumna:**
He had a //avataṁsa,// er, earrings... [break] ...seed, and with peacock... [break] Whose face is brightly shining. Peacock feathers around His crown and on His ears, and then it says, //gala deśe vanamālī.// [break] It was the source of all //sac-cid-ānanda// forms. He is the original //sac-cid-ānanda// form. And then his //bhakti,// his devotion, was aroused in this Kṛṣṇa, so then he began to pray. So he says //nikhila...// [break] ... section he is... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Son of Nanda Mahārāja, the source of all transcendental pleasure. [break]

**Pradyumna:**
//...sākṣāt anu bhūya tatraiva adbhūta bhakti niṣṭhah//[?]. His //bhakti.//

**Prabhupāda:**
As soon as the senses awaken with //bhakti// for Kṛṣṇa also become enlivened.

**Pradyumna:**
Therefore //taṁ eva vidyā varṇayati. Iti yā brahma//[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is Nanda Mahārāja[?] describing Him, about this feature of the Lord. [break]

**Pradyumna:**
//...sa naumi,// "I am praising You," //e īḍya, stutyā//[?], "who is to be praised." So he says, "You who are..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
What you are being praised?

**Pradyumna:**
//Īḍya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Īḍya.//

**Pradyumna:**
//Īḍya,// "worthy of being praised."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Pradyumna:**
He said, "You have just been praised by all of these, beginning from Brahmā down to all creatures. I have just seen You praised, all Your forms." So he says, //adhunā he īḍya//[?]... [break] ...praised by all beings. //Vāsudeva sa hun...// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sa// [indistinct]: ultimately to be worshiped. [break]

**Jayadvaita:**
Hmm. Supreme worshipful. [break]

**Pradyumna:**
The word here is, it says //te stomi enaumi te//[?], so there is grammatical meaning that will come to mean that "I praise You to obtain something." So he says, "What is that?" [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
It means "I offer my respectful obeisances."

**Pradyumna:**
Hmm. Using that with //te// it means //tvaṁ eva prāptam prasāda etām vā tvaṁ naumi//[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "First of all I worship, then I offer You my obeisances." [break]

**Pradyumna:**
"...Your body just like a cloud, a bluish cloud, and You have a dress just like the lightning." And he says by these descriptions Kṛṣṇa is like a cloud, and the dress is like the lightning in the cloud. Two things are mentioned. [break] ...that He takes away all the trouble, the affliction from the surface of the earth, and he says: //āvṛtāḥ bhakta cātaka jīvanā tvaṁ ca//[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct Sanskrit] "You are..."

**Pradyumna:**
Taking away, removing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "You are the taker-awayer of all kinds of [indistinct] material affliction." [break]

**Pradyumna:**
Just like a cloud, compared with a cloud with lightning, so //bhakta cātaka jivanam, jīvanātha tvaṁ ca//[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
"There is a //cātaka// bird, they are engladdened by seeing the cloud. Similarly, the //bhaktas// also become enlivened by seeing Your bodily features." [break]

**Pradyumna:**
...description of Kṛṣṇa's form, that He has peacock feather, so he says that this indicates..., this is //asār dhāraṇā lakṣaṇam//[?]. He says that the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Uncommon. Uncommon symptoms.

**Jayadvaita:**
Uncommon symptoms.

**Pradyumna:**
So he says that Kṛṣṇa is //īḍya,// "You are the best to be praised." And then he describes that Kṛṣṇa has these symptoms, how he draws the conclusion that "Your form of Vṛndāvana is even higher than Vaikuṇṭha form." He says, //vaikuṇṭha...// [break] //...kuñja// and this peacock feather from Vṛndāvana, and that is even much higher than this //vaikuṇṭha ratna, ratna 'laṅkāra,// decoration of jewels, etc.

**Prabhupāda:**
We should stop and listen. [end]
