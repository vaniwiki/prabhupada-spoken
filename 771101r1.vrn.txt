[Hindi]

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, you called for me?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I was asking how many men we can accommodate in the new building?

**Bhavānanda:**
Comfortably we can accommodate five to six hundred men in first-class rooms with first-class //pakka prasādam.//

**Shri Bajaj:**
That's already established, and people are already...

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, it's already established.

**Shri Bajaj:**
Functioning.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Shri Bajaj:**
But you have plans to further expand and add many more buildings and temples. Because I've seen the big plan.

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes. Prabhupāda has made a plan for fifty thousand devotees to live there.

**Shri Bajaj:**
Fifty thousand devotees in one place.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
What activities going on, just describe.

**Bhavānanda:**
At Māyāpur now we have two hundred resident devotees. We have the handloom; we have our own handloom production. We have //prasādam// distribution to the local people on the weekends. Two to three thousand people a day are given //prasādam,// and during the week seven hundred to a thousand take full //prasādam.//

**Shri Narayan:**
Free? All free distribution.

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes. And we have our //gurukula,// mainly local boys, resident boarding, no day students. When I left there were eighty-five boys. Probably it's increased.

**Shri Narayan:**
All local.

**Bhavānanda:**
All local. Our international //gurukula// is here. There is local.

**Shri Narayan:**
This is the international, here.

**Bhavānanda:**
This //gurukula// is international, and our //gurukula// in Māyāpur is mainly local Bengali boys, many coming from //brāhmaṇa// families, very nice.

**Shri Narayan:**
Then any industries? Hand industries?

**Bhavānanda:**
Our handloom.

**Shri Narayan:**
Handloom. [Hindi]

**Bhavānanda:**
And our //gośāla// is just developing. That area of Māyāpur, Navadvīpa, is a big handloom...

**Shri Narayan:**
Yes, handloom area.

**Bhavānanda:**
Many handloomers. So we have designs to expand that into a very large area, and most of it will be exported to our temples and devotees all around the world. And all of the handloom workers, they're devotees, so they don't take any salary. None of us take any salary. And they get nice rooming and full //prasādam,// and their children are educated. All medicine, everything is supplied to them.

**Shri Narayan:**
You could also, perhaps, introduce this new spinning wheel for the yarn. At present you must be purchasing yarn from the mills.

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes.

**Shri Narayan:**
But have you seen this small nice charkha, spinning wheel?

**Bhavānanda:**
Well, we do our own spinning.

**Shri Narayan:**
Spinning also?

**Bhavānanda:**
Oh, yes. We're training up those who have children... They're trained in the //varṇāśrama// system. Some of the children in the school have a scholastic bent of mind, so they're educated in Sanskrit and higher studies. Some of them have a //vaiśya// bent of mind, and they work in the //gośāla// helping to develop..., milk the cows. Some are... Their parents are working in the handloom. They also have that desire, so they're trained to be handloomers. In this way we will be able to develop a city of fifty thousand devotees.

**Shri Bajaj:**
Let us not overstrain him and whatever if... He'll feel tired.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you very much.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We have our main festival in Māyāpur at the end of March, March 24th.

**Shri Narayan:**
March 24th?

**Bhavānanda:**
This year? Dola-yātrā. Gaura-pūrṇimā.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Our biggest festival. All the devotees from all over the world...

**Prabhupāda:**
Recently there was a scientific meeting here. Where is that //Statesman// report?

**Shri Narayan:**
The report from..., about Māyāpur? Some literature?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, here. We... Just describe.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We had a science conference here in //gurukula// just about a little more than a week ago.

**Shri Narayan:**
Here in this new building?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, the same building, at the same hall that you're going to hold your conference. I invited several scholars, scientists around Delhi and Agra. Also Śrīla Prabhupāda's disciples, scientist disciples, came from around the world. The basic theme was to show that life is coming from the supreme life. In other words, everything is coming from Kṛṣṇa. But modern science says that we are just product of atoms and molecules.

**Haṁsadūta:**
This is an article which was published in //The Statesman,// October 22nd,

**Shri Narayan:**
I see.

**Haṁsadūta:**
...which covers this meeting. It says, "The Non-Physical View on the Origin of Species. Materialists and men of faith continue to disagree over the origins of life. According to the first group life is derived from atom and molecules..." [break]
