**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think I have printed list here. Sixty-three thousand copies printed. //Kṛṣṇa// book in Spanish, three volumes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
How many?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[looking up in list] I think 50,000.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[re-checking list] What is that? Yeah, 55,000 copies.

**Brahmānanda:**
Beautiful books, Prabhupāda.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is Volume One, Volume Two and Volume Three, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.

**Brahmānanda:**
These are printed in America by the same publisher who publishes the English ones.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now, here's a box. [sounds of boxes being opened] //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Tenth Canto, Part Two.

**Prabhupāda:**
English?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Another edition.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Another?

**Prabhupāda:**
Edition.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is the first time this is published. You haven't seen this yet.

**Brahmānanda:**
This is 10.2.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Tenth Canto.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, 10.2 [devotees exclaim] There's nothing quite as relishable as seeing your books in the English...

**Brahmānanda:**
It's beautiful.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These colors look great. This blue...

**Prabhupāda:**
Read it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Read it. From anywhere in particular?

**Prabhupāda:**
Anywhere.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"The Killing of the Demon Pūtanā." Should I read the chapter summary? "A summary of the sixth chapter is as follows: When Nanda Mahārāja, following the instructions of Vasudeva, was returning home, he saw a great demoniac woman lying on the road, and then he heard about her death. While Nanda Mahārāja, the king of Vraja, was thinking about Vasudeva's words concerning disturbances in Gokula, he was a little afraid and sought shelter at the lotus feet of Śrī Hari. Meanwhile, Kaṁsa sent to the village of Gokula a //rākṣasī// named Pūtanā, who was wandering here and there killing small babies. Of course, wherever there is no Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is the danger of such //rākṣasīs.// But since the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself was in Gokula, Pūtanā could accept nothing there but her own death." There's some other books, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Should I show you some more? [sounds of boxes being opened] //Teachings of Lord Kapila, the Son of Devahūti.// [devotees exclaim] Phew!

**Brahmānanda:**
You wanted this book. You gave the lectures in Bombay on Kapiladeva's teachings to Devahūti.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Ah, there's nothing like these books.

**Upendra:**
Oh, it's beautiful. Green cover.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is the form of this book?

**Brahmānanda:**
They're Prabhupāda's lectures on the particular verses from that...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One lecture after..., one verse after another.

**Brahmānanda:**
Plus the purports.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Text 29, text 28, text 27. It's like one chapter. It's one chapter of the //Bhāgavatam.//

**Brahmānanda:**
Purports and the lectures.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's more books.

**Brahmānanda:**
This is beautiful, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is another part?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Look at this! Very high class. You want to lean back, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hand-cut.[?]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here's a new book.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It says... It's called //Preaching is the Essence.// "His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda." It says, "Compiled by Rāmeśvara dāsa Swami and Śubhānanda dāsa Brahmacārī." It says, "A note of explanation. Every word of the text of this book is taken directly from the books of His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, founder-//ācārya// of the International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. The text appearing in boldface type is Śrīla Prabhupāda's translations of verses from the Vedic literatures. The text in regular roman type consists of excerpts from His Divine Grace's summary studies and purports. Contents in brief: 1] The mission of the Lord---to give all living entities the benediction of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. 2] It is the duty of the devotee to preach." Each one of these subjects, then they give verses or purports.

**Brahmānanda:**
All about preaching.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In other words, a devotee can use this book to learn these verses which substantiate the following points. These are the points. "3] Preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the highest welfare activity. 4] Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be distributed to everyone, without restriction."

**Prabhupāda:**
How many copies?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This was printed strictly for the devotees, two thousand copies only. It's meant as like a preaching weapon. "5] One who preaches Kṛṣṇa consciousness is dear to Lord Kṛṣṇa and is protected by the Lord. 6] Kṛṣṇa empowers the preacher. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement spreads by the mercy of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya. 7] Preaching is based on compassion. 8] The preacher should practice tolerance. 9] To be effective in preaching, the preacher must be pure and follow the regulative principles. 10] Conditioned souls benefit from hearing Vedic literature, //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// 11] The future of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness Movement." Should I see what it says under that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The future of this Movement? Page 88. "The future of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness Movement. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness Movement can save the world. 'Kirāta, Hūṇāndhra, Pulinda, Pulkaśa, Ābhīra, Śumbha, Yavana [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]] and the Khasa races, and even others who are addicted to sinful acts, can be purified by taking shelter of the devotees of the Lord, due to His being the supreme power. I beg to offer my respectful obeisances unto Him.' Purport: 'The above-mentioned historical names are different nations of the world. Even those who are constantly engaged in sinful acts are all corrigible to the standard of perfect human beings if they take shelter of the devotees of the Lord. Jesus Christ and Hajrat Muhammad, two powerful devotees of the Lord, have done tremendous service on the behalf of the Lord on the surface of the globe. And from the version of Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī, it appears that instead of running a godless civilization in the present context of the world situation, if the leadership of the world affairs is entrusted to the devotees of the Lord, for which a worldwide organization under the name and style of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness has already been started, then by the grace of the Almighty Lord there can be a thorough change of heart in human beings all over the world, because the devotees of the Lord are able authorities to effect such a change by purifying the dust-worn minds of the people in general.' " Then it gives so many other quotes. "Kṛṣṇa consciousness will spread all over the world." Then it quotes from the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta:// " 'The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will inundate the entire world and drown everyone, whether one be a gentleman, a rogue or even lame, invalid or blind. When the five members of the Pañca-tattva saw the entire world drowned in love of Godhead and the seed of material enjoyment in the living entities completely destroyed, they all became exceedingly happy. The more the five members of the Pañca-tattva caused the rains of love of Godhead to fall, the more the inundation increases and spreads all over the world.' " [break] [end]
