[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.//

**Shri Narayan[?]:**
[Hindi] ...improvement?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with Shri Narayan, talking of Delhi to Māyāpur, risk] What happened to the car?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Er, do you know the history?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes. First thing they had a flat tire. Then they ran out of gas, and then there was no petrol station. Then they lost the track. They went to some...

**Prabhupāda:**
So he missed the plane.

**Shri Narayan:**
Missed the place. Coming from Delhi?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes. They were supposed to come here at two o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have got my car, but they arranged for a Mercedes car.

**Shri Narayan:**
Mercedes car, bigger car, yes. Oh, I see. So that means God didn't want you to leave. [Hindi, talking of //Gītā// culture]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is Indian culture.

**Shri Narayan:**
Indian culture, //Gītā// culture. [Hindi, saying they are the same]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. [Hindi] Whenever there are discrepancies in the human society---//tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham//---at that time He appears. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. This is the program. And when He comes, the time is fixed. So unless one thoroughly studies, they cannot accept. Actually, Kṛṣṇa... //Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. This system, //Bhagavad-gītā,// it is //yoga, bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga// is the topmost.

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

There are many //yogas.// The aim is how to come to the topmost //yoga.// That is //bhakti-yoga.// And Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, //bhakto 'si me.// What is that verse? Eh? //Evaṁ purātanaḥ yogaḥ.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Bhakto 'si me sakhā ceti// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. //Rahasyaṁ hy etad uttamam.// "Because you are My //bhakta// and friend, therefore I am speaking to you the old system," //purātanaḥ.// No new system. The people now introduce new system.

**Shri Narayan:**
//Sanātana-jñāna he. Sanātana-jñāna he. Paramparā se.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Paramparā...// [Hindi] //...purātanaḥ yogaḥ.// They introduce their own interpretation. No [Hindi]. There is nothing required. What is that? //Sa te 'haṁ yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ. Purātanam.// Find out.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi telling about the two films shown]

**Prabhupāda:**
People of the world, they're hankering after this civilization. Unfortunately, we are miser. We are not giving them...

**Shri Narayan:**
All that they should get.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is not good.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is that //Bhagavad-gītā?//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Can you give me the verse?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ.// Find out the...

**Shri Narayan:**
The... Here it says sixteenth [Hindi].

**Prabhupāda:**
Fourth, fourth. Fourth chapter.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, I have the fourth chapter. I'm already in the fourth chapter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Read from the very beginning, fourth chapter.

**Ramkrishna Bajaj[?]:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I have the verse, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

> sa evāyaṁ mayā te 'dya
> yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ
> bhakto 'si me sakhā ceti
> rahasyaṁ hy etad uttamam
> [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]

Fourth chapter, third verse.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] So //yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.// Eh? Then?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Next verse?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Aparaṁ bhavato janma param...// [[books:bg:4:4|[Bg. 4.4]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Sa kālena yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.// Read it, //paramparā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**

> evaṁ paramparā-prāptam
> imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ
> sa kāleneha mahatā
> yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa
> [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. //Purātana,// the old system... [Hindi] //Yogo naṣṭaḥ purā..., sa kāleneha naṣṭaḥ.// [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You have a very nice purport here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Read it?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It says here, "It is clearly stated that the //Gītā// was especially meant for the saintly kings because they were to execute its purpose in ruling over the citizens. Certainly //Bhagavad-gītā// was never meant for the demoniac persons, who would dissipate its value for no one's benefit and would devise all types of interpretations according to personal whims. As soon as the original purpose was scattered by the motives of the unscrupulous commentators, there arose the need to reestablish the disciplic succession. Five thousand years ago it was detected by the Lord Himself that the disciplic succession was broken, and therefore He declared that the purpose of the //Gītā// appeared to be lost. In the same way, at the present moment also there are so many editions of the //Gītā,// but almost all of them are not according to the authorized disciplic succession. There are innumerable interpretations rendered by different mundane scholars, but almost all of them do not accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, although they make a good business on the words of Śrī Kṛṣṇa. This spirit is demonic because demons do not believe in God but simply enjoy the property of the Supreme. Since there is a great need of an edition of the //Gītā// in English as it is received by the //paramparā// disciplic succession system, an attempt is made herewith to fulfill this great want. //Bhagavad-gītā,// accepted as it is, is a great boon to humanity. But if it is accepted as a treatise of philosophical speculations, it is simply a waste of time."

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi] [laughing]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with guests] And it is natural.

**Shri Narayan:**
Natural, and it is really marvelous how it has happened. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
They were also hankering. And as soon as they got it, they got life.

**Shri Narayan:**
Yes, they got light. [Hindi between guests and Śrīla Prabhupāda, about willpower and ISKCON]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā.// You can go. They will talk with me something.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You want us to go outside, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Ramkrishna Bajaj:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda and Shri Narayan---"Hindustan philosophy"; Prabhupāda explaining about Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy] Excuse me. We are just talking alone with him. [break] [end]
