**Prabhupāda:**
What is the report?

**Akṣayānanda:**
They have just... Shri Narayanjī and Ramkrishna Bajajī have just left. I just saw them off. They are very happy. All the members of the committee, of their committee, they made a prayer that Your Divine Grace would have long life and good health. And regarding their meeting, I simply put their... They had the loudspeaker outside. I just put it inside so no passerby can hear, and they just did their business and left. There were no problems.

**Prabhupāda:**
What resolution they passed?

**Akṣayānanda:**
I do not know. [Prabhupāda laughs] I could not attend it, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I had to go... Next door we had some work with one //bābājī.// We had given him money last year, and I had to get that money back for his land. They're given a security.

**Prabhupāda:**
Money?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. We were using his land for a sewer, water waste. So we had given him two thousand rupees' security. We were going to buy that land. You remember once Your Divine Grace came to see it. We were going to put all that waste water and make a garden and all this. So now we have connected with the municipal sewer line, so there's no need for that land, and that problem is solved. So we took the money back that we had given as a security. I have been there for the last two or three hours, so I was unable to come.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have returned the money.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, they have returned it. Bhagatjī was there. He arranged everything. He is //pakka bāniyā.// He has arranged very nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
What about the gate?

**Akṣayānanda:**
That's going on. Construction is going on. Saurabha Mahārāja came yesterday, and he has given that idea. He had some objection before. He's clarified that objection. It was an architectural point, just for the beauty. So he's clarified that with the engineer, and it's going on now. I haven't had time, Prabhupāda, to talk to the members---some of the members are still remaining---about their conference, because I had to go for this work. But I'll go now and meet some of these gentlemen, get some idea what is their aims and objectives and resolutions. Otherwise, unfortunately, I could not be present there. But I'll give you a report.

**Prabhupāda:**
Their aims and object is superficially good, that "We altogether preach." But they do not know the ways.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Quite right.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is their defect. Neither they'll take up as it is. So it will be failure.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It is already failure.

**Akṣayānanda:**
It is failure.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The only success they had here is that they got your //darśana// and the //darśana// of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. In that sense it was a great success.

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not want anything. They want to assemble together and have some excursion.

**Jagadīśa:**
No more than the croaking of frogs.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, this morning, in the //Bhāgavata// class, we read a verse how Dhruva Mahārāja---not Dhruva Mahārāja, Bali Mahārāja---had been awarded all material opulences by the Lord, because of his devotion, not because of his //puṇya.// So I gave lecture to the devotees: in the same way Your Divine Grace, because of your devotion and preaching, Kṛṣṇa has given you every facility for propagating the Kṛṣṇa conscious movement, and although there are other nice movements in India, actually they should all join you. They should all surrender to you. We want that everyone should actually join us at your lotus feet because you have actually been given all //śakti// by Lord Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nahe tāra pravartana// [[books:cc:antya:7:11|[Cc. Antya 7.11]]]. So I told the devotees like this: "Do not be misled by others, even though they may be appearing to do nice work." Actually, you are the only one who is really distributing the message of Lord Kṛṣṇa. This is very obvious by the result. These others have not made even one foreign disciple. And if they did make one, he could not give up smoking, drinking and this and that. So there is no benefit whatsoever. Any intelligent person can see. Plus you have given us so much nectar. Prahlāda Mahārāja says //mahāmṛta.// I always think of that verse. You have given us so much nectar to absorb our minds in. There is really no chance that we will be influenced by these dry personalities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now you take up seriously and distribute. [aside:] It has finished.

**Upendra:**
Twenty-five.

**Prabhupāda:**
Only?

**Upendra:**
Yes. [pause]

**Akṣayānanda:**
Prabhupāda, we are very much relieved that you decided to stay. We are feeling very much happy that you are still remaining here. That trip would have been very difficult for you. [long pause; devotees chanting //japa//]

**Upendra:**
It is fixed.

[long pause; devotees chanting //japa//]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is the..., is in...?

**Upendra:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is the urine pot?

**Upendra:**
It is fixed.

[long pause; devotees chanting //japa//]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is finished.

**Upendra:**
One hundred.

**Prabhupāda:**
One hundred?

**Upendra:**
Yes. I think before because you were talking. You were engaging in conversation. Śrīla Prabhupāda, I'll just rub some //śuṣka muladi// oil on your feet?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Barley [Bengali]? [end]
