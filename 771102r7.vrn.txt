**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[looking at //Preaching is the Essence?//] Each verse is like a separate lecture, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, we shall...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall chant our beads or read book?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, we can... Which would you like?

**Prabhupāda:**
For me, everything is all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So we can chant //japa// for a little while.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And then we can read again. All right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [devotees chant //japa//] [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. We received... I received some results of book distribution from September, worldwide, very extraordinary figures. Actually, they are astounding figures.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] That is right. He misses news.[?]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[whispered aside] Call [indistinct] and find out the most recent newsletter from September. [break] This is very good, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This resting is very good. //Kavirāja// said that two things, resting and passing urine, are signs of recovery for you. Sleeplessness is bad. But constant resting means that the body is getting a chance to renew itself and take strength. He said that we should look for that resting as a sign of gradual recovery, called "rest and recuperation." [indistinct background talking]

**Prabhupāda:**
So?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'll just get it, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not that pillow.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Not that pillow? Is that all right? Says, "Book distribution, worldwide." Says here... These are the world totals for the month of September, Śrīla Prabhupāda. In the month of September all over the world they distributed the following number of big books: 215,914. 216,000 big books in one month, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Medium books: 226,000 in one month. Small books: 237,000. And //Back to Godheads:// 433,000. Now I calculated, Śrīla Prabhupāda, also the total amount of money realized by the BBT. In the month of September the BBT sold..., the temples sold 675,000 dollars' worth of books. In rupees, I figured out it's fifty-nine //lakhs// the BBT sold. Now, the temples, when they..., if they sell a book, they get double the amount of money. You know what I mean? If the BBT sells the book to the temple for say $2.50, the temple gets $5.00 when it sells the book. So I calculated that the temples collected $1,350,000 from selling your books in the month of September, which comes out to one //crore,// seventeen //lakhs// collections from book sales. And then I was calculating what this would mean... [end]
