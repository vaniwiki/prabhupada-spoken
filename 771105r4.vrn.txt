**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi]

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi]

**Śatadhanya:**
Finished with the urine, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [Bengali]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhakti-caru, Prabhupāda is talking to you.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi to //kavirāja// assistant] Śrīla Prabhupāda wants him to come every day, once a day, and check him out. [Bengali to Prabhupāda]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hundred cc's, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Your urine was 100 cc's.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, urine is all right. Urine, it is all right. I am lying here. He can come conveniently.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhakti-caru, Prabhupāda says he is lying here, so the //kavirāja// can come whenever it's convenient, 'cause he's always here.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Right. That's what I told him.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you should pay for that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No problem.

**Prabhupāda:**
Appreciate.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Appreciate. There's no problem for that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja// assistant]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What was that?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda is asking him how did he get to know Shastrijī. So he said that it's I who took him there and...

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda and Bhakti-caru; discusses urine color]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[to Śatadhanya] Is it slightly yellowish, the color?

**Śatadhanya:**
Yellowish and clear. Yellow, clear.

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda and Bhakti-caru; Prabhupāda asks about his family]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja// assistant, discussing medicine and milk]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How will he stop the stool?

**Bhakti-caru:**
[long Hindi conversation with //kavirāja// assistant and Prabhupāda as //kavirāja// prescribes and Bhakti-caru takes notes]

Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Bhakti-caru, what is he going to give for stopping the stool?

**Bhakti-caru:**
He's trying to figure out why he's passing stool, from the medicine. Śrīla Prabhupāda? [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-caru]

[indistinct background conversation between Bhavānanda and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa]

**Bhavānanda:**
Bhakti-caru, what is he saying? Anything?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes.

**Bhavānanda:**
What?

**Bhakti-caru:**
He's saying that for controlling the stool he's going to just give juice of ginger roots and honey mixed together, and just that. He's not going to give any other medicine for that.

**Bhavānanda:**
Gentle.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That will stop the stool?

**Bhakti-caru:**
He's saying yes. He doesn't want to change this medicine. He says that none of these medicines has any ingredient that might cause stool or might make him pass stool. And... [Hindi with //kavirāja//] He's saying that passing stool is due to the old stool that was in the stomach. That is coming out. They are not laxatives, as such. Now I remember, he was telling also, that Shastrijī, that Śrīla Prabhupāda's intestine has become shrunk, dried up. Now they are slowly, slowly, they have got to become loose and looser, and this might be one thing, like the intestine is loosening, and that is causing the bowels to move.

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-caru]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So if that is true, then why should he stop the stools?

**Bhakti-caru:**
No, I mean since it's causing inconvenience... So that... He's saying that these two agents are natural digesters, both ginger juice and honey.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Natural digestives? So what does that have to do with stopping the stool?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Anyway, since he said, we can just try it. [Hindi with //kavirāja// assistant] He's not actually bind..., causing it to stop. He said that it will... Now, last few times, Śrīla Prabhupāda has passed very light stool and liquidish. So this thing, ginger root and honey, will make it sort of thicker.

**Bhavānanda:**
Less often.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes.

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja// assistant and Prabhupāda]

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi]

Bhavānanda: Bhakti-caru---what?

**Bhakti-caru:**
He's asking lastly whether, while passing stool, there's a feeling that the stomach has been cleared, kind of a constipated feeling, in spite of..., half way. Śrīla Prabhupāda said that it was happening like that before, but last few times it was liquidish. It was watery stool, so there is no question of...

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-caru]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhakti-caru, what's going on?

**Bhakti-caru:**
He was wondering about one medicine that has some roots and herbs mixed together and boil it for a long time and just give the extract of that. He was wondering whether that medicine, how I have that medicine... There are different items in it. That //vaidyajī// already made, mixed it together. So he was wondering about that medicine, how it is, how do I keep it.

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi; talks about the honey and ginger]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So he can come every day in the morning? He can come every day, like Prabhupāda said?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes, he's going to come. [Hindi with //kavirāja//] He told me yesterday also that there should be continuous prayers.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi about charge]

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How much?

**Kavirāja assistant:**
Eight rupees. [Hindi] Is minimum charge. [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All right then. [indistinct comments]

**Prabhupāda:**
He said that "I want to see you, [indistinct]." Still, we can pay him. I'll do. And this... Send him car.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Car? Or he can take rickshaw?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Is it close from here? [Hindi with //kavirāja//]

Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: He can take a rickshaw, surely.

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi, asks if rickshaw is all right]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We'll do that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja// and Bhakti-caru] So you do... Account for that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, I know. We'll give him.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct conversation about paying the //kavirāja//'s assistant's fare to and from his home]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And rickshaw he'll take back and forth? Rickshaw's one rupee each way.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Prabhupada said give him five rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, one rupee fifty... [indistinct discussion about rickshaw prices]

Bhakti-caru: It's three rupees both ways, actually.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's all right.

**Kavirāja assistant:**
[Hindi; takes leave] [break] [end]
