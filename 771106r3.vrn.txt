**Bhagatjī:**
Sometimes when I used to come you were sleeping. I'll sit for one hour and then went out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Things are going on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhagatjī was working very hard, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Too hard. Sometimes he missed his meals in the last two days to do that. I never saw... Even a young man could not work so much as he worked in the last two days. Śrīla Prabhupāda? I think we can... If you allow, Bhavānanda Mahārāja and I can sit you up for a minute to drink a little barley milk? Then you can lay down and take good rest. Taking a little warm thing at night is helpful for sleeping. It's relaxing. We never were used to that, but since we met Your Divine Grace, we're always taking a little warm milk at night. So you'll allow us to give you a little? Okay. [pause]

**Bhavānanda:**
Bhakti-caru? [pause]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'm simply praying that Kṛṣṇa in your stomach accepts everything, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [pause] Water from [indistinct]? Would you like to lie down now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Pass urine.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. We'll lay you down, and you'll pass urine. Okay. We're just getting the bottle. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali or Hindi conversation with Indian guest about Caitanya Mahāprabhu]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Tomorrow Svarūpa Dāmodara is giving a lecture in Agra, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Indian guest:**
In Agra? In some university?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Agra.

**Indian guest:**
Great.

**Prabhupāda:**
Agra, which?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Agra which university, Svarūpa Dāmodara?

**Indian guest:**
Agra University is itself a universtity

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Agra University is composed of several colleges. It's called Agra College, actually. It's the biggest university in Agra.

**Bhagatjī:**
And Agra University is the biggest university in U.P.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Many students.

**Bhagatjī:**
It contains so many colleges outside Agra also. Just in Aligarh, in Mathurā, all are affiliated to Agra University. All other universities in U.P. are local universities, just like Allahabad, Benares, Lucknow.

**Prabhupāda:**
This, our Bon Mahārāja's, that is also...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Affiliated.

**Bhagatjī:**
Affiliated to Agra University, this university, this quarter, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Some people came here to the temple from Manipur today, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Did you preach to them, Svarūpa Dāmodara?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. They are very impressed. They said they'll come many. They told me they're going to come many, in many numbers.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about that temple in Manipur?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I was thinking that we can start it...

**Prabhupāda:**
Receive them nicely.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
The Manipuri devotees, receive them nicely.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Receive them nicely. Didn't some Manipur devotees visit Caitanya Mahāprabhu in Jagannātha Purī sometimes?

**Prabhupāda:**
They go.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They are all Vaiṣṇavas.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. Just on the western gate of Jagannātha Purī there is also a place for Manipur. Devotees there, they serve Lord Jagannātha in Purī, special section for Manipur on the western gate of Jagannātha Purī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere. Navadvīpa there is Manipur Mandir. Here also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, the Maharani of Manipur Mandir in Navadvīpa.

**Indian guest:**
In Vṛndāvana also, Prabhupāda, there is one? Which is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
The Sevā-kuñja.

**Indian guest:**
Sevā-kuñja.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Also in Rādhā-kuṇḍa.

**Indian guest:**
Rādhā-kuṇḍa there is, I know.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That Sevā-kuñja is under the charge of the Manipuri devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Manipur devotees are very enthusiastic.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So is Svarūpa Dāmodara.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Agra University, you lectured professors?

**Indian guest:**
Amongst profesors, or the students also?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, professors and students; mostly the professors, from all departments: physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology and philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Big!

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They also asked me to bring a film from the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. So I'm going to show the "Spiritual Frontier" just after the lecture. So I'll go with the Fairchild, the movie projector.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. When you have to go?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The lecture is at 3:15, so I'll go about 11 because I like to also talk personally with some professors to become members of the Institute. That's one of our projects.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Svarūpa Dāmodara is enrolling members, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Indian guest:**
To build his Bhaktivedanta Swami Institute?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hmm. How many members you have so far?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We have, so far, four. But one of the biggest men in Agra Medical College, Dr. Malviya, he became a member. He's a very well known biochemist. So he told me that he's going to contribute articles. We would like members, the professors of chemistry, physics, mathematics, biology.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It seems like there is a good future for Bhaktivedanta Institute, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Who will be president?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who will be president? Of the institute, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, tomorrow.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who will be present? President of the meeting?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh, it's arranged by the head of the chemistry department. There's one professor called Gupta. He's very enthusiastic. And there are also several professors who came to our conference. All of them actually are arranging together. There's one Dr. Sukla, also there's one Dr. Sharma. Three, four of them are organizing the lecture. They have... Most of the people I found there, they have great respect for ISKCON, and they appreciate Śrīla Prabhupāda's activities so much. I also requested them it is their responsibility to actually try to spread the genuine knowledge as a real science, scientists.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Stories and fables will not convince them.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I want to briefly outline tomorrow the comparative presentation of two aspects of modern science versus the //Bhagavad-gītā,// the varying concepts of life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We'll outline, saying that modern science thinks that we are children of chance and chemical reactions, but the //Gītā// says we are children of Kṛṣṇa. We are coming from the supremely conscious person.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So these two views, completely opposed. And I'm going to propose that...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is a common sense. There is mother and there is children. Where is the father? They have no common sense even. Everything is produced... There are four kinds of living entities: //udbhid-ja, sveda-ja, aṇḍa-ja// and //jarāyu-ja.// They do not know anything. You are taking account of the //jarāyu-ja,// not //udbhid-ja, sveda-ja, aṇḍa-ja.// They think the trees are coming automatically. That is their theory. That's not fact. //Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. //Bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:7:10|[Bg. 7.10]]]. They do not consider this. A bug is coming from bed---they think it is automatically. No. The //bīja-pradaḥ pitā...// There are four kinds of births.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Four kinds of...?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Births.

**Bhagatjī:**
//Udbhid, sveda, aṇḍa// and //jarāyu-ja//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. What is that //jarāy...?//

**Bhagatjī:**
//Jarāyu-ja.// Man, animal...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Womb.

**Bhagatjī:**
Womb is everyone. That comes...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sweat?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's one. And womb. Egg.

**Bhagatjī:**
Egg is this birds.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And...

**Bhagatjī:**
And //aṇḍa-ja.// Birds.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Aṇḍa-ja,// from eggs.

**Brahmānanda:**
//Udbhid-ja.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Eggs, sweat, womb...

**Prabhupāda:**
And vegetable.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Seed.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Udbhid-ja.// They take account of the //jarāyu,// not other three.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's womb.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Embryo.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, embryo.

**Prabhupāda:**
So science means to know everything, not only theoretically. They say "automatically."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Their knowledge is so unscientific, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The knowledge that they propose, chance, is so unscientific. Sometimes I wonder. In the name of science they make the most unscientific remarks.

**Prabhupāda:**
The answer is there: "Here our father." They'll not accept. Without father, how there can be son? You do not know who is the father. Why the particular tree is giving particular fruit, particular flower, and this is exactly like...? What do they answer?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They actually have no answer.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] From the rose tree, why rose flower come, not other flower? This is a species. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati// [Padma Purāṇa]. They have no knowledge.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Without coming to Kṛṣṇa consciousness it's not possible for them to understand. That is the root cause, that they're trying to assume that everything is coming out of chance. But once they...

**Prabhupāda:**
These people, Gītā-pratiṣṭhāna, they spoke in Hindi. So there were so many foreigners. If Kṛṣṇa consciousness is meant for Hindu or Hindi, not for others, what do they say?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are... They only spoke in Hindi. That means they're very narrow-minded.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Kṛṣṇa conscious. And Kṛṣṇa said, //ahaṁ bīja-prada..., sarva-bhūtānām.// And "Gītā-pratiṣṭhāna."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They don't have even the human respect of a gentleman. The real gentlemen, they won't speak like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
For that reason, they are compact within India. They cannot go out. Who will care for their Hindi? And they're nationalism, and at the same time...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
They are so many false...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That means they don't understand the spirit of //Gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Anyway, during the two days that they held their meeting, we distributed about thirty thousand //Bhagavad-gītās// around the world. Every day we distribute at least ten thousand //Gītās// per day in different languages.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhagavad-gītā sañjaya.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This year, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we will have distributed about two million //Bhagavad-gītās,// in different languages. One year. [break] [end]
