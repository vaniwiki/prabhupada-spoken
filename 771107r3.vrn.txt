**Prabhupāda:**
//Kavirāja// says that he has so many nice patients he will not leave. So how he's treating now?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I have not inquired about that, Śrīla Prabhupāda. His point was that they depend upon his presence for treatment. That means that even if they were to die because he was not personally available to treat them, he did not think that it was very much important in comparison to treating Your Divine Grace. Because they are materialists, so whether they live or die does not affect anything so much. But because you are a great transcendentalist, your presence means that so many thousands of people can be saved. [pause] How are you feeling, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not so good. I am passing stool.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We'll bring that to his notice. Now that he's here, all of these things can be adjusted. Actually, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he explains that because of the fact that you have not eaten for so many months, all of your inside has become dried up and shriveled, and therefore you cannot expect that you'll be healed very quickly. He says it will take time, but it can be done. As far as your passing stool, you are passing so little stool that it's not very significant.

**Śatadhanya:**
[whispering] He passed stool at 2:45 this afternoon. Śrīla Prabhupāda, you passed stool once this afternoon and then in the early morning, previous morning, you passed stool. So actually today has not been a lot of stool at all, and it was very small amount.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So he was explaining that because everything is so dried up and shriveled inside, now we have to make your body used to taking in foods again and giving off the natural secretions and other juices that are necessary. It takes time. He feels that it's certainly possible, and we certainly hope it is possible.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Turn me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] ...passing is not a very big amount, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Practically it's hardly anything at all. But because it requires for you to be cleaned, therefore you're a little bit bothered by it. Otherwise, in proportion to what you're drinking, it's not unusual. Rather, it's a little healthy, because if you weren't passing it, then we'd have to make it come by giving douche or something. So the //kavirāja// explained, though, that gradually he has to work on each thing. I'm hopeful, Śrīla Prabhupāda, even though you say you're hopeless. Of course, it's our duty to follow your lotus feet; so whatever your view is, it's our view. But you have to kindly permit us that in this one instance we can have a disagreeing view that although you are hopeless, we should remain hopeful, although it's always our duty to have the same view as you have. [pause] Are you desiring to have some //kīrtana,// Śrīla Prabhupāda? Or would you like to rest for a while.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I want rest.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You want to rest. So we'll keep it very quiet for a while. I'm just writing some letters, so should I continue to do that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'm in the next room in case you want me. Bhavānanda Mahārāja and Śatadhanya Mahārāja are here. We'll keep everything quiet for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] [end]
