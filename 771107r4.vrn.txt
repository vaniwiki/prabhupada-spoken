**Pañca-draviḍa:**
...everything was together. But when you add up our sales, whole zones put together, then they're as big as New York and the other areas now. They are doing nicely. They've also brought you some gifts---one sweater and some warm socks and a scarf for the winter here in Vṛndāvana.

**Prabhupāda:**
So keep it. I shall use it.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
They also brought one wooden bowl for eating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
They brought one wooden plate for eating also.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Where did they put them at?

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
In the office.

**Bhakti-caru:**
It's locked from that side. Someone has got to go and get it.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
I can bring it. They also said Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja, he is in Brazil, but he is returning in a little while. [pause]

**Jagadīśa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like us to have //kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, we've brought some juice, grape juice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can sit you up, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That will make it easier to drink. Bhavānanda Mahārāja and myself are here. We can hold you up for a minute?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Drink for a minute.

**Bhavānanda:**
Only for a minute.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Should we hold you up for a minute?

**Prabhupāda:**
So if I eat here...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Laying down?

**Prabhupāda:**
...what is wrong?

**Bhavānanda:**
The only problem is then the tendency is to take less.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's easier to drink when one sits up. We can hold you up. [harmonium and //kīrtana//]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is warm now. Hmm.
