[kavirāja arrives---Hindi discussions with Prabhupāda] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with Bhagatjī; Prabhupāda asks about Puruṣottama Gosvāmī]

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-cāru and Prabhupāda]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
It's less now, this restlessness and the pain.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-cāru]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He didn't pass urine after that. Last one is at five past twelve.

**Bhavānanda:**
That's all. He hasn't passed any since then.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He asking about urine, Śrīla Prabhupāda, whether you passed urine afterwards. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
No, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tamāla is there?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, you reply the letter of M. M. De, "In the absence of your bank abeyance[?], we shall send you the money to your house address, and other address that you do not disclose, we cannot send there."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
His other address, since he does not disclose, we cannot send there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. "You'll get your money at your house." Is that all right?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Śrīla Prabhupāda? Do you want us to give something towards repairing this Caitanya Mahāprabhu Mandir?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is there any amount in particular that you want to be given?

**Prabhupāda:**
First of all make an estimate.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's some maximum amount?

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhagatjī?

**Bhagatjī:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
You can assist?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You have any idea?

**Bhagatjī:**
I can go... [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayapatāka can go with him. This man who came yesterday was Visvanath Mishra?

**Bhagatjī:**
Balaram.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The man who came yesterday was Balaram Mishra?

**Bhagatjī:**
Yes, Balaram Mishra.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yesterday, that was Balaram Mishra or that was Visvanath Mishra?

**Bhagatjī:**
Balaram Mishra.

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He wrote down. I think I told you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Have some //kīrtana.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya.//

**Bhavānanda:**
Have some //kīrtana.// [//kīrtana//]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What did Prabhupāda say?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
Whether that temple belongs to some particular person.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[aside:] We have to find out who that temple belongs to.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nāhi,// Bhagatjī.

**Bhagatjī:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda and another Indian about the temple] [whispering in background: "Prabhupāda keeps asking. He's not going to stop until he finds out." Talk about Prabhupāda going back to sleep now] [Hindi with Prabhupāda] That signboard on the gate. Signboard on the gate. Of that I have to [indistinct]. [Hindi with Prabhupāda] Bhaktivedanta Swami Gate... [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is the name of the gate meant to be?

**Bhagatjī:**
Bhaktivedanta Swami Gate on one way; and Bhaktivedanta Swami Dvāra in Hindi the other way. [indistinct background discussion with devotees]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? [Bengali---gives Prabhupāda //arak// to drink, then water]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...begun some //pūjā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ask him not to do any more [indistinct].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Not to do anymore, unless he does it here.

**Prabhupāda:**
If he cannot do here...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hmm. Seems like he's mostly after money, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Is that true?

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone says like that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. I got that feeling when I saw him. I felt it was very inappropriate that he should come here and in your condition he should be pressing you for money like that. I didn't feel it was very proper. So, er, Bhagatjī is going to be going looking at that temple, so I can tell him that he should tell Balaram Mishra that unless he does the //pūjā// here, then don't do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhagatjī has not gone?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, I'm going to go over to his house right now and just see, Śrīla Prabhupāda. All right? And if Bhagatjī's still home, I'll tell him that he should tell that to Balaram Mishra. Either he does the //pūjā// here or don't do it at all. Is that all right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You want him to do it here, though?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All right. All right, I'll do that, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I'll come back and let you know what happened. In case Bhagatjī's already gone, then... I'll investigate, Śrīla Prabhupāda, right now.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhavānanda:**
Upendra and I would like to give you an oil massage. Is that all right? But to do full, good job, we have to lay you on your back. Is that all right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Whatever you like. [break] [Hindi]

**Nitāi-cānda:**
[Hindi discussion with Prabhupāda and Bhakti-cāru about preaching and distributing books; Prabhupāda becomes very emotional talking about Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Nitāi-cānda discusses Māyāpur and distubution of //prasādam,// and //gurukula// there, also preaching parties]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
[Hindi discussion of books printed and distributed]

**Jayapatāka:**
[Bengali about //Bhagavāner Kathā// being reprinted]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Śatadhanya:**
How many people are coming in one year now? [break] [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They say that Māyāpur's book distribution will soon be rivaling the... [break] [end]
