**Nitāi-cānda:**
[Hindi with others]

Kavirāja: [Hindi]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He gave a medicine yesterday to control the stool, so we have to get it today.

**Kavirāja:**
Pulse still ninety.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Ninety. That's not bad. But is it strong or weak?

**Kavirāja:**
Not stronger.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Stronger. Your pulse is stronger now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Shastrijī says that your pulse is normal rate and stronger. I think the //kīrtana// is having a good effect, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda about //hari-nāma// as medicine---//bhavauṣadhi//]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, Shastrijī was saying that when he gives someone medicine, he gives the medicine, and then because he's a doctor, he doesn't care, it may work or not work. But with you, he said he's become too much attached. He does not know why, but he's become very much attached, and now he's too much determined that his medicine must work. He can't feel indifferent when he treats you.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda]

Bhavānanda: Bhakti-cāru?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He's explaining about the medicine, that if he gets the medicine it will be all right.

**Bhavānanda:**
Which medicine?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
The one that he went to look for in the forest.

**Bhavānanda:**
Oh.

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He's telling that Prabhupāda's condition is not bad right now. [indistinct] take care of him and Prabhupāda shouldn't be left alone.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda] [sound of blood pressure pump] One forty by seventy-five.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Seventy-five.

**Kavirāja:**
I have been correct.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Just right. What was the pulse this morning?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
[Hindi with Kavirāja] Morning his pulse rate was 115.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi] ...good condition... [Hindi]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
Now his heart is in perfect order.

**Bhavānanda:**
So what was the cause of that distress?

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He says Prabhupāda has done it himself.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda and Bhakti-caru]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
The color of his stool was greenish this morning. So that's good. That shows that the liver is working.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi] [laughter]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
"It's a pity that you can't understand me and I can't understand you."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, we are understanding.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-cāru; mentions pathological tests, pulse, heart]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He says from pathological point of view, there is nothing wrong.

**Kavirāja:**
General condition has become good.

**Bhakti-cāru:**
His condition of the heartbeat is perfect.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So what is wrong?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
Blood pressure is perfect.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It is a spiritual thing...

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
At that time it happened, but now it's all right.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
Saturn is having its effect, like at times when he was looking at Śrīla Prabhupāda then getting some trouble. When his vision was somewhere else, than when the Saturn looks higher from him, then he becomes...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But what did Prabhupāda just say?

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
No, when he said that pathological test...

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He said how can you define it? How can you explain it? Like the condition couldn't have improved by ten medicines also, but just one medicine it became perfect.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What did Prabhupāda just say?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
Prabhupāda just said that I mean, this morning his condition was bad, not now.

**Bhavānanda:**
Prabhupāda was complaining of mental distress this morning also.

**Bhakti-cāru:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
[Bengali] ...mental distress?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm-hmm.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi---//bole bole//]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi---mentions word "poison"]

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-cāru:**
[indistinct] ...someone gave him poison here.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi, long explanation about Śaṅkarācārya disciple being poisoned]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda was thinking that someone had poisoned him?

**Adri-dhāraṇa:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That was the mental distress?

**Adri-dhāraṇa:**
Yes.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What did Kavirāja just say?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He said that when Śrīla Prabhupāda was saying that, there must be something truth behind it. [People all speaking at once; asking about the //ācārya// that was poisoned by powdered glass]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, Shastrijī says that there must be some truth to it if you say that. So who is it that has poisoned? [pause]

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-cāru and Prabhupāda asking about poison and discussing //makara-dhvaja//]

**Woman devotee:**
What did he say?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
He said that it's quite possible that mercury, it's a kind of a poison...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That //makara-dhvaja.//

**Bhakti-cāru:**
No, he's saying not that.

**Kavirāja:**
//Ras-kapur//[?]. [Hindi with Kavirāja and Bhakti-cāru] It is very poison.

**Bhavānanda:**
What was he taking, Prabhupāda, before that?

Kavirāja: [Hindi]

**Bhavānanda:**
What medicine was he taking before that?

**Bhakti-cāru:**
//Yogendra-ras.// No, he was referring to a case, big murder case in Calcutta, the husband poisoned the wife.

**Bhavānanda:**
In Guha. Oh, yes. Our lawyer is the...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhagatjī doesn't think the [indistinct].

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-cāru and Prabhupāda, chants a Sanskrit verse]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No poison is strong enough to stop the //hari-nama,// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Kavirāja:**
//Bās.// [Hindi]

**Devotee:**
Prahlāda Mahārāja.

**Bhakti-cāru:**
Prahlāda Mahārāja also.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi about Prahlāda and poison]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Would you like some more //kīrtana,// Śrīla Prabhupāda? Lokanātha can lead. Lokanātha, you lead.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Lokanātha.

**Lokanātha:**
Not for chanting, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Lokanātha:**
We just had a big //kīrtana,// but I could chant more. I have come a long way to see you and chant for you. So if you allow, I will chant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Lokanātha:**
Yes. Been chanting all day in the //ratha.// [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[aside:] Jagannatha Puri also. All right, I'll tell him.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have taken your van?

**Lokanātha:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
You take your van and three o'clock there.

**Lokanātha:**
Three o'clock is all right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Four.

**Lokanātha:**
Four o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
How is the climate outside?

**Lokanātha:**
There's not cold so far. Lucky I came today. It's good climate.

**Haṁsadūta:**
At night it's a little chilly, and in the day it's very pleasant and warm.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, other parts of India.

**Lokanātha:**
Oh, north. As we go towards the Himalaya it gets cold; otherwise up to Delhi and Chandigarh same climate as it is here now. As soon as we got into the mountains, it was very cold. We were shivering. But as we came to the plains, wherever we went the same climate. Same as Vṛndāvana. It's a good climate.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you come at four, [indistinct]. [break] [end]
