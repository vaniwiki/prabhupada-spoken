# Spoken by His Divine Grace

This repository contains audio transcripts from His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada.

In our [vani.wiki](https://vani.wiki) way, we use DokuWiki markup for the archive, the only in-content syntax `**bold**` and `//italic//`, which makes it easy to read in a plain text editor. We would love to see forks, maybe converted into Markdown via [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), for broader compatibility. You can then add this to your website or app as you like.

The best reading experience we have found for this archive is on an iPad with Textastic, dark theme set to Sunburst. While the json headers could be removed in a git branch (as they are redundant in such apps), that is not our priority at the moment.

This repository supports translations, so if you want to help out make translations or add existing ones, please reach out.

We are currently working on reimporting content. A big thanks to helpful friends!
