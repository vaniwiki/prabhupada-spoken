This repository hasn't been updated for 1966-1971. At the time I did the new transcripts, they were 1972-1977. I shared that content with my friend thinking he will share back one day, but alas. So we will have to rely on Ekanatha prabhu for the files, and do one final export from VedaBase.

What is unique with our digital archive here, is that the same is used for online publication. So not only is it easy to read in its raw form, but it also doubles as a direct-to-website content publishing backbone. What about that!

The files for 1972-1977 were taken from VedaBase 2015.1, but will be outdated with the many updates that went into VedaBase over the years.

The files for 1966-1971 is still from the old tape ministry files, and should be updated asap to correlate to the latest unedited audio files.
