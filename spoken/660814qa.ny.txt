====== Bhagavad-gītā 4.34, Questions & Answers ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Brahman and Supersoul, we have been discussing this morning... Perhaps just we began the verse and you have forgot. Just like myself, I am soul, the spiritual soul. My place is within this heart. Now, in the medical science, they have found it that the heart is the center of all vitality of this body. Modern materialistic science they have found that whatever we are eating, it is going to the stomach and it is being transformed into various types of secretions, and the important secretion is coming to the heart and it is becoming red by coming to the heart. Then again from the heart there are many veins; it is being distributed to different parts of the body. So... But they could not found that where is the point wherefrom this vitality is coming. Wherefrom this vitality is coming? They could not find it. They have localized that here is the source of all energy.

So in the //Bhagavad-gītā// you will find that Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate... Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]: "I am the origin, fountainhead of everything, and everything what is being produced, it is from Me." Similarly, the soul is a fragmental fractional portion of Kṛṣṇa. So now the modern scientists, they have localized the point wherefrom the energies are coming. Now that point is there, that fragmental portion of Kṛṣṇa is there in the heart. That is Brahman. And... But that is fragmental portion. Brahman means this fragmental portion, and the Supreme Brahman... What was that question? Brahman? Supersoul. Supersoul is Kṛṣṇa. Supersoul is Kṛṣṇa, and we..., I am, you are, you are soul, we are //jīva,// and the Supreme Soul is Kṛṣṇa. This verse the next morning we shall discuss, we came this morning up to that point. We've come up to that verse.

So Supersoul, Supersoul is the Supreme Lord. Supersoul is also there. They are situated together. From the Vedic //Upaniṣads// we get this information that two birds are sitting on one tree. The one bird is eating the fruits, and the other bird is simply witness. So witnessing bird is the Supersoul, and the bird which is enjoying and suffering of this material contamination or attachment, that is soul. Is it clear?

**Devotee (1):**
You mean actually Kṛṣṇa is in here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa... Yes. He is in the [indistinct] You are very intelligent. This Supersoul is also partial representation of Kṛṣṇa. Just like the sun, the real sun, and the reflection of sun. If you have got thousands of pots in your presence, you will find the reflection of the sun in thousands of the pots, but the real sun is one. Similarly, this Supersoul is the reflection of the reality, partial reflection of the Supreme. Is it clear? Just like you are standing here, and at noon the sun is on your head, and five thousand miles away you inquire from somebody, "Where is sun?" He will say, "Oh, it is on my head." Five thousand miles this way or that way, any way you inquire, many, many people, many thousands of people you inquire, they will say, everyone will say that "The sun is on my head." Similarly, although the sun is one, as he is perceived that he is present on everyone's head, similarly, although Kṛṣṇa is one without a second, by inconceivable transcendental power He can be present in everyone's heart. //Akhilātma-bhūtaḥ. Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. That is the power of Kṛṣṇa. That is the power of Supersoul. We cannot. Suppose I am sitting here, you are sitting here. You are not at your home. I am not in India, I am sitting here. I cannot see simultaneously in India and America. That is not possible, because I am not Supersoul. But the Supersoul can be present everywhere. You will find this explanation in the Thirteenth Chapter of the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Now we are discussing the Fourth Chapter. When you go to the Thirteenth Chapter, this point will be more clearly explained.

**Question:**
[indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...about the spiritual master. So your question should have been on the matter of spiritual master because we invite questions on the subject which we discuss in the purport. This is also relevant question, because we will read in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Now we have discussed about the position of the spiritual master. Now, if you have got any questions about that, the relationship between the spiritual master and the disciple, if you have got any doubts, if you have any questions, ask it.

**Devotee (1):**
If one surrenders to a spiritual master, what then is their relationship to Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Spiritual master is the representative of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, surrendering to the spiritual master means surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. He is the bona fide. Spiritual master is just like, as just I explained the //śloka, hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi vidhunoti suhṛt satām.// I'll try to relate one nice story in this connection, the story of Dhruva Mahārāja. Dhruva Mahārāja was a child, and he was insulted by his stepmother. So he went to his own mother and he prayed, "My dear mother"---he was five years old only---"my stepmother has insulted me in this way. I was sitting on the lap of my father and she dragged me out. She told me that 'You cannot sit on the lap on your father.' " So he was the son of king, so he felt insulted and he went to his mother and cried. Then he asked his mother, "What is the remedy?" Because he was a son of a //kṣatriya,// he was resentful. So his mother directed, "My dear son, your father do not care for me, so he will not hear whatever I say. So if God can help you, then you can get revenge." Then---he was child---he said, "Oh, where is God?" Then mother replied, "Oh, we understand that God is in the forest. Somebody goes to the forest and realizes God. So you cannot go, my dear son." "No, I shall go." So he went to the forest. He went to the forest, and he was asking the tiger, "Oh, you are God?" The elephant, "You are God?" Just like a child. Then when he was so serious, then, because God is within himself, then he was..., Nārada was sent to him, that "You go to the boy. How he is anxious that what is the actual point [indistinct]. You just try to help him." So this is the process. When we are seriously anxious about understanding the science of God, then God is within you, He will make your relationship with such a spiritual master who will enlighten you further and further. So practically, the spiritual master is the representative of Kṛṣṇa. Now, it depends on me. //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. The degree of my serious thought, if I am seriously about actually perception of the Supreme Lord, then I will get such a spiritual master who can give me information of the Supreme Lord. But if I want something else, then Kṛṣṇa will help you in that way also, you will get something else. So //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante.// The spiritual master is the representative of Kṛṣṇa, and He, Kṛṣṇa, is sitting within our heart. As you are anxious, your degree of anxiety will be helped by Kṛṣṇa by sending similar quality of spiritual master. [end]
