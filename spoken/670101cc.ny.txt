**Prabhupāda:**

> 'nitya-līlā' kṛṣṇera sarva-śāstre kaya
> bujhite nā pāre līlā kemane 'nitya' haya

//Nitya// means eternal. Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, appearance and dis..., disappearance, is continuous and eternal. There is no stoppage. Lord Caitanya says, //bujhite nā pāre līlā kemane 'nitya' haya.// Ordinary persons, common men, cannot understand how //kṛṣṇa-līlā,// Kṛṣṇa's appearance and disappearance, can be eternal. Generally, we think that Kṛṣṇa appeared five thousand years before; now He's no longer. So either He's dead or gone. Just like ordinary man takes his birth and stay here for some time and then he goes away---no more, no trace of that particular man's activities. He's lost in the whirlpool of this material ocean. Neither exactly in a similar body, that particular living entity will again come back. Once. This form which you have got, material form, it is just like a bubble in the ocean. It is formed somehow or other according to our past actions and reactions, and it will stay for hundred years at most. Then it will disappear. And there will be no trace where that particular individual soul has gone. Of course, there is account in the books of Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Vedāhaṁ samatītāni// [[books:bg:7:26|[Bg. 7.26]]]. He says, "I know everything." And He's always constant companion. As Supersoul of the individual soul, He knows. But we, the persons of a particular person's relatives, father, mother, brother, all these things---who knows? Nobody can give information. But Kṛṣṇa's appearance and disappearance is not like that, because He's not different from His body. We are, in our conditioned stage, we are different from our body. But Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's body is the same thing. This is to be understood. //Sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1]. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda vigraha.// His form is eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. This material body is not like that. Therefore we cannot understand how //kṛṣṇa-līlā// is eternal, continuous eternal.

That is being instructed by Lord Caitanya:

> dṛṣṭānta diyā kahi tabe loka yadi jāne
> kṛṣṇa-līlā---nitya, jyotiścakra-pramāṇe

//Jyotiścakra-pramāṇe. Jyotiścakra// means orbit of the planets. The, a planet is moving in its orbit continually. Similarly, //Kṛṣṇa-līlā// is also just like an orbit. He's giving very nice example: orbit of the earth, orbit of the moon, orbit of the sun. The sun is also not fixed up. According to Vedic astronomy, the sun is also moving. We have got information from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and other Vedic literatures, //Brahma-saṁhitā.// In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is stated that //yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇām.// The sun is considered to be the eyes of the Supreme Lord, and the sun is the king of all other planets. //Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā. Savitā// means the sun. //Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa tejāḥ. Sura-mūrtiḥ.// Every planet is dominated by a particular demigod. There is a, a principal living entity who is differently named. Just like this moon planet is called //Candraloka// because the predominating deity there is called Candra; the sun planet is called //Sūryaloka// because the predominating deity is called Sūrya. Sūrya, Candra---these are official names, just like "governor." But the particular name is also there. Governor is a particular person. Just like "president." President is a general name, but he has got his particular personal name. Similarly, all these predominating deities of //Candraloka// and //Sūryaloka,// they are, these are official names. Anybody who's predominating over the sun planet, he's called Sūrya, but he has got his personal name. That name is Vivasvān. That is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. Who is that Vivasvān? Vivasvān is the present predominating deity in the sun planet.

This sun planet, according to your modern science, it is fixed. But we cannot understand why sun should be fixed. Every planet has its orbit. So sun must be moving in the orbit. That is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā: yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā.// He's the king of all planets---//rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa tejāḥ. Aśeṣa tejāḥ// means inexhaustible temperature. The sun planet has got inexhaustible heat and temperature. That we can experience. Nobody can say what is there that the sun planet is diffusing unlimited temperature and heat for millions and trillions of years, still, it is not exhausted. So this is called //aśeṣa. Aśeṣa.// There is no end. Just like we are in the fire. Unless we put some fuel, fuel, it is not possible to continue the temperature. But there, the supply is so, so sufficient that there is no end of temperature. Every planet is self-sufficient. That is described in the //Īśopaniṣad. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ yat kiñcit jagatyāṁ jagat...// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. No. //Pūrṇam idam, pūrṇam adaḥ, pūrṇaṁ pūrṇāt udacyate pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam eva avaśiṣyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. The Supreme Lord is //pūrṇa. Pūrṇa// means complete. And whatever He creates, that is also complete. The actions and reactions of sun planet to diffuse heat all over the universe is complete. By Lord's grace, by Lord's creative power, energy. That is also inferior energy. This is not superior energy. This is inferior energy. So still it is complete.

So... So He is giving example as the planets, sun planet, moon planet and other planets, are moving in their orbits, similarly, //kṛṣṇa-līlā// has got a orbit, and the //līlā// is going on. As the sun is moving or the planets, the earth planet is moving exactly at the same time. Just after twenty-four hours it will be meridian, and at 12 o'clock, just twenty-four hours. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa's //līlā,// exactly after certain millions of years, it will be seen in this planet. Similarly, there are innumerable universes, and it is moving from this, that, this, that... Now, just like //kṛṣṇa-līlā,// just Kṛṣṇa born at, at the prison house of Kaṁsa... Vasudeva, father, and Devakī, mother. Immediately, as soon as the child is born, the next, the next universe, there is birth. So same very thing. Just like now it is quarter to eight according to sun calculation. Immediately, you'll find some other place quarter to eight. Immediately you'll find quarter to eight in other place. Immediately... So quarter to eight you cannot change. Quarter to eight will exist within this movement of the sun planet or earthly planet. Anywhere, somebody, somewhere must be there quarter to eight. At any time. Even at 12 o'clock at night you inquire, "What is quarter to eight of the sun planet?" you'll have. Is it not a fact? This is called //nitya-līlā.// How nicely Caitanya Mahāprabhu has described.

So //Kṛṣṇa-līlā// is always going on like that. Kṛṣṇa's birth, Janmāṣṭamī... We observe Janmāṣṭamī. But that Janmāṣṭamī is going on every moment. Janmāṣṭamī is going on. Kṛṣṇa's //nitya-līlā. Kṛṣṇa-līlā-nitya, jyotiścakra-pramāṇe. Jyotiścakre sūrya yena phire rātri-dine.// Now here it is also, in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// it is said that here //sūrya// is also on the orbit. //Sapta-dvīpāmbudhi laṅghi' phire krame krame. Sapta-dvīpa.// Now, according to Vedic calculation, this earth has seven, I mean to say, islands. Just like crossing the sea, we have come to your country from India. The crossing the sea means there are different islands. Now you can calculate the Asia, Europe, America, and, and, how many?

**Devotee:**
Seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
Seven, there are?

**Devotee:**
Six.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that is calculation in Vedic know... //Sapta-dvīpa. Sapta// means seven. As the sun is coming in the orbit and crossing all the seven islands, similarly, Kṛṣṇa is also coming in this universe, that universe, that universe. When He comes into this universe, He, He is seen in that tract of land which is called Vṛndāvana. Therefore that tract of land is so sacred. Lord Caitanya describes by His mission, //ārādhyo bhagavān vrajeśa-tanayas tad dhāma vṛndāvanam. Ārādhya,// the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, is worshipable Deity, and His //dhāma,// and His headquarters---and His //dhāma// means headquarters-Vṛndāvana. Therefore Vṛndāvana is so important. When Kṛṣṇa comes... Just like when the sun appears in your country there is a particular city or place... Where it is where the sun first seen? Where it is?

**Devotee:**
Greenwich, Maine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Greenwich.

**Devotee:**
Uh huh.

**Prabhupāda:**
In your country, America?

**Devotee:**
What is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Where the sun is first seen?

**Devotee:**
Anybody know?

**Prabhupāda?:**
Oh, you cannot say?

**Students:**
Maine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Maine? Just like Maine is the first place where is seen sun, similarly, Vṛndāvana is the place where Kṛṣṇa is seen first. The example is very nice. //Sapta-dvīpāmbudhi laṅghi' phire krame krame.//

> rātri-dine haya ṣaṣṭi-daṇḍa-parimāṇa
> tina-sahasra chaya-śata 'pala' tāra māna

Now Caitanya Mahāprabhu is submitting His knowledge in astronomy. Astronomy. And He's dividing the whole day and night into sixty //daṇḍas.// According to Vedic calculation of time, the whole day and night... Just like, according to Western system, the whole day and night is divided into twenty-four hours, they have divided into still further... Sixty //daṇḍas.// They are called //daṇḍas. Tina-sahasra... Rātri-dine haya ṣaṣṭi-daṇḍa-parimāṇa.// The whole day and night is divided into sixty parts. //Tina-sahasra chaya-śata 'pala' tāra māna.// And these //daṇḍas// are again subdivided into three hundred and sixty //palas.// They are called //pala. Daṇḍa// and //pala. Sūryodaya haite ṣaṣṭi-pala-kramodaya.// And the sun rises in every sixty //pala.// We can, we can see sun is rising, but not all of a sudden we can see. But gradually. That gradual, I mean to say, elevation of the sun planet is..., takes sixty //pala// times. //Sei eka daṇḍa, aṣṭa daṇḍe 'prahara' haya. Prahara// means three hours, and that is //aṣṭa daṇḍa.//

> eka-dui-tina-cāri prahare asta haya
> cāri-prahara rātri gele punaḥ sūryodaya

The whole day is divided into four //praharas.// So at the end of the day, of the four //praharas,// the //Sūrya,// this sun planet sets. //Cāri prahara rātri gele...// And similarly, four //praharas,// when passed at night, again the sun planet is seen.

> aiche kṛṣṇera līlā-maṇḍala caudda-manvantare
> brahmāṇḍa-maṇḍala vyāpi' krame krame phire

//Caudda-manvantare.// There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmā. So //kṛṣṇera līlā-maṇḍala caudda manvantare.// So in the fourteen //maṇḍalas,// the, the I mean to..., the orbit of //kṛṣṇa-līlā// is, I mean to say, circumambulating. So He is..., He is seen in the Manu's life, in the fourteen Manu's life. There are fourteen Manus. In each Manu's life, there are seventy-one //catur-yugas,// in each Manu's life. In the twenty-eighth //catur-yuga,// Kṛṣṇa, in the Dvāpara-yuga, appears. There is mathematical calculation. //Soayāśata vatsara kṛṣṇera prakaṭa-prakāśa.// And when He is in this universe, He remains here for 124 year, 125 years. When Kṛṣṇa was here He was for 125 years. And when He was in the battlefield, His age was about 100 years, almost 100 years. Because, just after finishing the battlefield, He went to Dvārakā, and, after some days, He disappeared. So I think it was more than hundred years when He was fighting as charioteer of Kṛṣṇa. Just imagine, a hundred-years-old man, how many children and grandchildren, great-grandchildren, might have. In those days, the boys were married... Still in India boys are married in early age. The boys and girls were married just after sixteen years, especially in the //kṣatriya// families. They are very developed because they can eat very nicely, they live very nicely. So their body development is very nice. They can beget children even at fifteen years old---in those days, especially. So Kṛṣṇa had, at that time, great-grandchildren when He was fighting in the //Kurukṣetra.// He was... He came just to help His friend Arjuna. He did not take part in the fighting; He was charioteer. Now you have seen the Kṛṣṇa's picture. He looks like a twenty-years boy. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanam// [Bs. 5.33]. //Nava-yauvanam//---just a fresh youth. Youthful luster. He's very nice, beautiful. So He is seen like that, //kiśora. Kiśora.// Just sixteen-years-old boy.

> So, tāhā yaiche vraja-pure karilā vilāsa
> saoyāśata vatsara kṛṣṇera prakaṭa-prakāśa
> tāhā yaiche vraja-pure karilā vilāsa

So within these 125 years, all the pastimes that Kṛṣṇa displayed during His presence, all those things are going on in each and every universe, just like the sun planet is moving from one place to another. This is the idea of //Kṛṣṇa-līlā.//

> alāta-cakra-prāya sei līlā-cakra phire
> saba līlā saba brahmāṇḍe krame udaya kare

So //saba līlā.// And all the activities, they are manifested in either of the so many //brahmāṇḍas.// So at every second you just divide that 125 years into seconds and all, less than second, what it is? Of course, I do not know... But if you divide in that way, then you can calculate how many universes are there. How many seconds are there in one hour?

**Devotee:**
Three thousand?

**Prabhupāda:**
Three thousand?

**Devotee:**
Three thousand, six hundred.

**Prabhupāda:**
Three thousand, six hundred seconds in one hour. Then what are the twenty-four hours? [laughs] Just see.

**Devotee:**
A pencil and paper...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. No. Just imagine that 360 seconds in one hour, so in one day we have got 24 hours. So 360 into 24, that becomes the seconds in one day. Then you multiply it into 30. That means in one month. Then you multiply it by 12. Then it comes to one year. Such 125. So you can calculate. At least you can imagine who many universes are there---by that calculation of second, and if you go further detail.

So God's creation is wonderful. Nobody can... Everything is unlimited. He's unlimited. His creation is unlimited. His pastimes are unlimited. His forms are unlimited. Everything unlimited. Everything. His incarnations are unlimited. Everything. Just like see, even in your own body, can you count how many hairs are on your body and head? They are unlimited. I am claiming "This is my body," but I do not know how many hairs are there. But you ask Kṛṣṇa, He'll tell you. Especially Howard cannot say how many hairs are there... [laugh] Who can say? Howard cannot say. So this is Kṛṣṇa's creative energy. You see. And He is aloof. All things, all these wonderful things are going on, but He's aloof. He's aloof. //Nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ.//

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]

These are inconceivable energies. And foolish rascals, they claim that "I am God." You see. God is not so cheap. One must know the science of God, how great is God. We cannot calculate. Those who cheaply take God, "God might be like me, you," just frog philosophy. The same frog philosophy. The frog is calculating the length and breadth of Atlantic Ocean, keeping itself in the well. You see. So similarly, these rascals, they are frogs in the well, and they are calculating the estimation of the length and breadth of Atlantic Ocean and claiming themselves as God.

> janma, bālya, paugaṇḍa, kaiśora prakāśa
> pūtanā-vadhādi kari' mauṣalānta vilāsa
> kona brahmāṇḍe kona līlāra haya avasthāna
> tāte līlā 'nitya' kahe āgama-purāṇa

So Lord Caitanya says, "Just like the time calculation of the sun is always present in the orbit of this earthly planet, similarly, in the orbit of //Kṛṣṇa-līlā,// everything is happening in some universe." That is called //nitya-līlā.// Because it is happening eternally and continually, in either of innumerable planets, which we cannot calculate, therefore His pastimes, appearance and disappearance are all eternal. We are not worshiper of a dead thing. Just like if a foolish person says at night, "Oh, sun is finished." How? "I cannot see. Because I don't see in the sky, it is finished." Similarly, the foolish person thinks, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is..., I cannot see; therefore He's finished." This is foolish calculation. Now, from the description of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we can understand that Kṛṣṇa is not dead and gone. He's present always and every time, everywhere. And if we are sincerely in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that Kṛṣṇa is always with us, He gives us protection, His mercy is there. Everything is there. With this conviction, we should continue Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is not a manufactured, false identification, but it is fact, and we have to follow great personalities like Lord Caitanya, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who actually established the science of Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇāya...// As Rūpa Gosvāmī, he, he prayed Lord Caitanya:

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]

"Oh, I offer my respectful obeisances unto You because You are so magnanimous that You are distributing the love of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wanted, when He, when He was present, that 'You love Me, surrender unto Me. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].' Now people misunderstood. But Your process of preaching Kṛṣṇa philosophy is so nice, by the //saṅkīrtana// movement, that everyone can understand the Kṛṣṇa philosophy very easily. Therefore You are the most magnanimous incarnation, and I offer my respectful obeisances unto You."

Thank you very much. [end]
