====== Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā 7.39–47 ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...accustomed to follow the Vedic principles. Just like in Christian religion, those who do not follow the Bible, they are called heathens. Similarly, in Muslim, those who do not follow the Koran, they are called //kafirs.// Similarly, those who do not follow the Vedic principles, they are called //nāstika// or //mlecchas. Nāstika// means those who do not believe in the Vedic principles, they are called //nāstika,// atheist. And those whose behavior is not very clean, they are called //mlecchas.// So in comparison to Hindu mode of living and others in the world, there is very great difference, social sanctity and personal sanctity. So therefore, formerly the //mlecchas// means the Muhammadans, because they are meat-eaters, they do not take bath daily and there are so many things. So even those persons who were delivered by Lord Caitanya, but the author says that He could not deliver the Māyāvādīs, the impersonalist //sannyāsīs.// That means it was easier for Him to deliver the //mlecchas,// but it was difficult for Him to deliver the Māyāvādīs. In other words, the author is trying to place the position of the Māyāvādī //sannyāsī// less than the //mlecchas.// Less than the //mlecchas.//

So, //sabe eḍāila mātra kāśīra māyāvādī.// Māyāvādī means materialist. //Māyā// means this matter, and //vādī// means those who stick to this principle of material... There are different kinds of materialists. Because we should always know that up to the point of intelligence, it is matter. First point is the senses, the gross. The grossest type of materialist is that they are addicted to sense gratification. So this is materialist. And above this, there are mental speculators. They are also materialists because mind is matter. So the sense gratifiers and the mental speculationists, and those who are trying to reach spiritual perfection by bodily exercise... Because body is not at all spirit; it is matter. But by intellectually, by making proper adjustment... Just the only benefit of such exercises is to concentrate the mind. The mind is very disturbed. So that is also materialist. That means //jñānī,// yogi and //karmī. Karmī// means those who are working very hard day and night simply for sense gratification. That's all. They are called //karmīs.// And //jñānī// means they are finding out solution by mental speculation. And yogi means they are trying to find out spiritual salvation by bodily exercises. They are all, in strict sense, they are all materialist. There is no question of spiritualist. Spiritualism [means] there where one understands that what is the constitutional position of spirit and act according to that. Therefore //bhakti,// this devotional service, is only spiritualism because those who are devotees, they know that they are eternally part and parcel of the Supreme Lord, and therefore to be engaged in transcendental loving service of the Supreme Lord is spiritualism.

So,

Māyāvādī... The followers of Śaṅkara's school, they are generally called //Māyāvādī.// And another Māyāvādī are called the Buddhists. So in the Kāśī, in Benares, there were two kinds of Māyāvādīs. One kind of Māyāvādī, the Buddhists, they have got still Sarnath. Buddhists temples there are because Lord Buddha, he started his meditation near Gayā at about hundred miles off from Benares. Then his disciples established monasteries near Kāśī because Benares is well-known sacred place since a very long time, so they also established there. Formerly there was no such animosities between the Hindus and the Buddhists. They were practically on the same platform, but philosophically they were different. Just like the Māyāvādīs, the followers of Śaṅkarite, they are still Hindus. They are not out of it. Similarly, Buddhists also were considered as Hindu. But when Buddha religion was completely driven away from India's boundary, then now it is considered another sect. So the Kāśī Māyāvādī means both the Buddhists and the followers of Śaṅkarites.

So when Lord Caitanya was living at Benares, on His way to Vṛndāvana... Not... He never made His headquarters anywhere else except Jagannātha Purī. Even Benares... He was worshiper of Vṛndāvana, but He did not make His headquarter at Vṛndāvana. So when on His way to Vṛndāvana He stopped at Benares and was staying at Candraśekhara's house, and He was taking His meals at the house of Tapana Miśra. So when He was passing---because His only propaganda was Hare Kṛṣṇa, just we are doing---so when He was passing on the road, all the people joined, all the people. It is... It has got so attraction. Even nonsignificant persons like us, when we chant, it attracts people, and what to speak of Lord Caitanya? He is personally chanting. So it attracted many people. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu within three, four days became very famous man, and everyone began to say, "Oh, from Bengal, nice //sannyāsī,// beautiful //sannyāsī,// a young //sannyāsī// has come, and He is come," and they were chanting and dancing, and people were very much attached to Him. In this way there was some propaganda in the city.

But the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// they could not tolerate. They were, I mean to say, backbiting. What they were saying? "Oh, here is a //sannyāsī,// and He's dancing." According to Māyāvāda //sannyāsa,// this dancing and singing is forbidden, forbidden. In Muhammadan religion also, dancing and singing is forbidden. I do not know what is there in the Bible, but I understand in the Bible there is //saṅkīrtana// allowed. I have asked our Kīrtanānanda to write some article, "//Saṅkīrtana// and Bible," because he is, he knows Bible very well than other members. So we shall see very nice how in Bible there is //saṅkīrtana.// The Muhammadan Koran, they do not... In some of their sections, there is //saṅkīrtana,// not within the mosque, but without. Anyway... So similarly, these Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// they also do not like singing and dancing. Of course, now they are stopping, finish. They are also taking now to this process of singing and dancing in India. So formerly they used to, I mean to say, decry. So //sannyāsī ha-iyā kare nācana gāyana:// "Oh, here is a //sannyāsī.// He is dancing and singing." //Nā kare vedānta-śravaṇa:// "He does not give His attention for studying //Vedānta,//" //kare saṅkīrtana,// "and always engaged in Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa." //Mūrkha sannyāsī:// "That means He has [no] knowledge. He has not studied all this //Vedānta// philosophy, and He's a nonsense. What He can do?" Sometimes we are considered a nonsense because we have no other stock except chanting. And actually, we have no stock except chanting. But why do we talk of philosophy? Because the fools want to talk of philosophy. Otherwise, there is no need of talking philosophy. Simply by chanting, everything is complete. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu was showing this example, and other Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// criticizing Him, "Oh, here is a, a foolish, is a," mean, "a illiterate //sann...//" Because there were many illiterate //sannyāsīs// also in India. "Illiterate //sannyāsī.// He does not know how to execute..." [aside:] Oh, I have forgotten. [break] "...how to execute the //sannyāsa// life. Therefore He's chanting and dancing." This sort of criticism was going on. //Bhāvuka ha-iyā phere bhāvukera sane:// "And there are other sentimentalists who are also equally foolish and ignorant. So therefore they are following this //sannyāsī.//"

//E saba śuniyā prabhu hāse mane mane:// "When Lord Caitanya was being criticized in that way, He was smiling. He was smiling, 'What can I do?' " So,

> e saba śuniyā prabhu hāse mane
> upekṣā kariyā kāro nā kaila sambhāṣaṇe
> [[books:cc:adi:7:43|[Cc. Ādi 7.43]]]

"He was very grave. 'Oh, let them criticize. Let Me do My duty. That's all.' "

> upekṣā kariyā kaila mathurā gamana
> mathurā dekhiyā punaḥ kaila āgamana
> [[books:cc:adi:7:44|[Cc. Ādi 7.44]]]

So because He was busy at that time for visiting Vṛndāvana, so He did not take care of this, and He went, left Kāśī, or Benares, after three, four days, and, er, although He was criticized, but He did not challenge. He went to Vṛndāvana.

> kāśīte lekhaka śūdra-śrīcandraśekhara
> tāṅra ghare rahilā prabhu svatantra īśvara
> [[books:cc:adi:7:45|[Cc. Ādi 7.45]]]

Now, at Benares He stayed and in the house of Candraśekhara. Candraśekhara was not a //brāhmaṇa,// and a //sannyāsī// is not supposed to stay any place except in the house of a //brāhmaṇa// or in a temple. Otherwise, he is considered lower. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not care for all these formalities. He used to stay with Candraśekhara although he was not a //brāhmaṇa,// a //śūdra,// a laborer class, or little more than that. So why? Because He is completely independent, because He is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is taking the shape of a hog. //Keśava dhṛta-śūkara-rūpa.// Hog is considered to be the lowest animal because it eats stool. Just like in human society, those who are dog-eaters, they are considered the lowest of the human society, similarly, amongst the animals, the hog is considered to be the lowest of the animals because it eats stool. But Kṛṣṇa took the appearance of a hog. That does not mean that Kṛṣṇa has become a hog. He is fully independent. And what sort of hog? That hog was covering practically half of the universe. It, He was so big. And in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// there is very nice explanation of the incarnation of hog. The... And They were being praised. The incarnation of hog was being praised from higher planets. The higher planets, three higher planets, they are resided by most pious men. They are called //Janaloka, Tapoloka// and //Satyaloka.// These three higher planets, they are considered to be the most pious place within this material world. So they were praying, and when the incarnation of hog was sprinkling water by, I mean to say, shaking His body, and the sprinkle of the water was dropping in those three //lokas,// planets, and they were thinking themselves that "We are becoming purified," although they are considered to be the most pious and purified residents of this material world, still they prayed that "We are becoming purified." So Kṛṣṇa or His devotee, they're independent. They are not under the rules and regulation of this material world. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed this example, that He was staying at a place which is considered abominable by other //sannyāsīs.//

//Kāśīte lekhaka śūdra-śrīcandraśekhara. Lekhaka śūdra// means he was a clerk, clerk. The clerk, clerical post was offered to the //śūdras,// to the laborer class. There was a strike in Calcutta of the clerks. George and Skinner [?], an European firm, they had many jute [indistinct]. The clerks, I mean to say, made a strike. So when their, I mean to say, chief man met the manager, so, and asked that "Whether you want to compromise with us?" the manager said, "No. I don't wish to compromise with you. I don't care for you because you are educated laborer." He gave the title to the clerks, "educated laborer." So actually in Hindu society, the clerks were called educated laborers. So here it is //lekhaka śūdra. Lekhaka śūdra// means clerk, but he's //śūdra. Lekhaka śūdra śrīcandraśekhara, tāṅra ghare rahilā.// But spiritually there is no such distinction. We should always remember that materially, there may be higher, lower class. There is, always, in every society, in every country. But spiritually there is no such consideration. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's propaganda. He made Haridāsa Ṭhākura---he was a Muhammadan---as the spiritual master for //saṅkīrtana, namācārya.// And He picked up Sanātana Gosvāmī and Rūpa Gosvāmī, who were rejected by the Hindu society, and He made them //gosvāmīs.// That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's peculiarity. And here also we see that a //śūdra,// a laborer class, a clerk, who is considered to be lower in the society, He was staying at his house.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu... And Rāmānanda Rāya, he was also a //śūdra,// and he was a householder and a politician, governor, but Caitanya Mahāprabhu took instruction from him. Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave him the preference of being a teacher. He was hesitating. Rāmānanda Rāya was hesitating, "Oh, Sir, You are //sannyāsī,// in the highest stage of //āśrama,// and You, in Your previous life You belonged to the //brāhmaṇa// sect. So You belong to the highest class, and I am a //śūdra,// I am householder, and I am a politician. So how lower I am in comparison to You? And You are taking instruction from me, so I am feeling hesitation." Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "No, no. You don't feel hesitation." He enunciated,

> kibā śūdra kibā vipra nyāsī kene naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]

"Never mind a man, whatever he is. He may be a laborer class, he may be a //brāhmaṇa,// or he may be a //sannyāsī,// or he may be a householder. It doesn't matter. Anyone who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, he is spiritual master. Anyone." That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's, I mean to, highest con..., especially for the Hindu society. They have got so much caste distinction, lower and higher and this and that way. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu broke all these barriers. His simple process was: anyone who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is welcome; he is the highest personality in the world. That was His proposal.

So He did not care that "What people will say that I am staying at a //śūdra's// place?" No.

> tapana-miśrera ghare bhikṣā-nirvāhaṇa
> sannyāsīra saṅge nāhi māne nimantraṇa
> [[books:cc:adi:7:46|[Cc. Ādi 7.46]]]

So He was staying with a //śūdra// and He was taking His meals at another //brāhmaṇa...// He was also not //sannyāsī,// but he was a //brāhmaṇa.// So in this way He was staying at Benares.

So this, this incident is that Caitanya Mahāprabhu, first of all He visited Benares and went to Vṛndāvana. Then, while coming back, He stayed at Allahabad, Prayag, for ten days for instructing Rūpa Goswami. That we have already discussed. Now again He has come back to Benares. So He was staying at Candraśekhara's house, and He was taking His meals at Tapana Miśra's house. In the meantime, Sanātana Goswami came to see Him. Sanātana Goswami, after retirement, he had many troubles. He was arrested by the Nawab because Nawab thought him that he was very important hand. "He has now... By sentiment, he's going to Caitanya." So he thought it wise to arrest him. And Sanātana Gosvāmī had some money, so he bribed the superintendent of jail, and he let him go away. So with great difficulty, he reached Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he met Caitanya Mahāprabhu at Benares, and for two months he was instructed all the principles of devotional service and different incarnations. We have... Some part of this Sanātana instruction, we have discussed. Again we shall discuss. So this Sanātana Gosvāmī met at Benares while Caitanya Mahāprabhu was returning back from Vṛndāvana. We shall discuss this point tomorrow.

Thank you very much. [end]
