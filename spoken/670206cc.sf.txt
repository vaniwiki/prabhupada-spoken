====== Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā 7.66–76 ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, they are now together. Now there will be discussion. Now Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī, he [is] asking Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "I think Your name is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, and You are disciple, You have accepted this renounced order of life from Keśava Bhāratī." As I've explained to you, that there are ten different names in the Śaṅkara //sampradāya// of the //sannyāsīs,// and there are 108 names amongst the Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsa.// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu, although He was initiated by Vaiṣṇava, He took //sannyāsa,// He accepted //sannyāsa,// from Bhāratī, who belongs to the Śaṅkara //sampradāya, Śaṅkara// sect. The rule is that if one has to accept renounced order of life, there is ceremony; as there is ceremony of initiation, there is ceremony of accepting this renounced order of life. And that ceremony must be performed by another bona fide, I mean to..., //sannyāsī,// renounced order. It is not that you take your cloth and get it colored and one day you become a //sannyāsī.// No. There are ceremonies. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu took //sannyāsa// from Keśava Bhāratī. This Keśava Bhāratī belonged to Śaṅkara //sampradāya.// Therefore Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī also belonged to Śaṅkara //sampradāya.// So he's asking that "I understand that Your name is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya."

Now, there are different kinds of names of //brahmacārī// also under the guidance of a //sannyāsī.// So the person who is under the guidance of Bhāratī, the //brahmacārī's// name is Caitanya. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu, although He took //sannyāsa,// He did not change His //brahmacārī// name. That is also very significant. Because in the Māyāvādī //sannyāsa,// as soon as they take //sannyāsa,// they think that, "I have become Nārāyaṇa." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu, although He was regularly a //sannyāsī,// He did not change His name of //brahmacārī.// That means //brahmacārī's// meant for serving the spiritual master. So He continued to be a servitor. That is the significance. So Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī's asking that "You are a //sannyāsī// of our //sampradāya// because You have accepted renounced order from Bharati. So what is the reason that You do not mix with us?" That is his first question. "And another complaint is that You are a //sannyāsī.// You should devote Your time in discussing philosophy, Sāṅkhya philosophy, and //Vedānta-sūtra.// You should learn. You should understand. Why You have taken //sannyāsa?// And what is this, that You are simply dancing and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare?" This was his first question. Yes. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu was simply dancing and chanting. This is the specific contribution of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Because, amongst the Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// dancing and chanting is considered to be material. So that is also, they take, it is also one kind of sense gratification. So //sannyāsa// means they should stop sense gratification. So this is also, according to them, sense gratification, because they took it as ordinary singing.

So Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī asked Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "Why do you follow this sentimentalism, chanting and dancing? You are a... And some of the foolish persons, who have no knowledge, they also follow You. What is this?" //Vedānta-paṭhana, dhyāna, sannyāsīra dharma.// "You have taken //sannyāsa,// renounced order of life. Your duty is to study //Vedānta// always and meditate." //Tāhā chāḍi' kara kene bhāvukera...// "And You have given up all these procedure. And You are simply chanting and dancing?" //Prabhāve dekhiye tomā sākṣāt nārāyaṇa.// "So far I see You, from Your bodily features, oh, You appear to be very glorious. You are very intelligent." Because He was boy. Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī was very elderly, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu was only twenty-four years old. So he's appreciating that, "From Your face it appears that You are very learned, advanced. And why do You indulge in this sentimentalism?" This is very important question, and answer you should know. This //saṅkīrtana// movement... //Hīnācāra kara kene, ithe ki kāraṇa:// "So this is not deserving to a //sannyāsī.//"

"Yes. You are right, My dear Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. You are right. But there is reason why do I do it. Now I can explain to you. When I took //sannyāsa// from My Guru Mahārāja, from My spiritual master, he found Me a rascal and fool number one, rascal." So //guru more mūrkha dekhi' karila śāsana:// [[books:cc:adi:7:71|[Cc. Ādi 7.71]]] "So, because he found Me a foolish person, therefore he has chastised Me." Why? What is that? "He said //mūrkha tumi:// 'You are foolish. You have no education. You are illiterate.' " //Tomāra nāhika vedāntādhikāra:// " 'It is not possible for You to understand //Vedānta.//' " //'Kṛṣṇa-mantra' japa sadā---ei mantra-sāra:// " 'Therefore, You simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. That will make You all right.' " Now here is the point, that was Caitanya Mahāprabhu a foolish person? No. He was not a foolish person. In His childhood He was known as Nimāi Pandit, the greatest learned man. Even when He was sixteen years old, He defeated another very learned fellow from Kashmir. So He was reputed scholar, and He was known. And Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī knew it that Caitanya Mahāprabhu, even in His //gṛhastha āśrama// or in His householder life, He was a teacher of //nyāya,// logic, and He's great learned man. He knew it. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that "My spiritual master found Me a rascal, a fool [[books:cc:adi:7:71|[Cc. Ādi 7.71]]]. Therefore he said that 'You have no chance for understanding //Vedānta.// Therefore You take to this principle: chant simply Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare.' " What is the purpose of presenting Himself as fool and rascal? The idea is that in this age, 99.9% are fools and rascals; therefore it is very difficult for them to understand what is the purpose of //Vedānta.// He's representing Himself as one of the fools and rascals.

So Cai..., according to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the so-called //Vedānta// societies, the so-called, I mean to say, learned scholars on //Vedānta,// they are not actually //Vedānta// scholars. They are all fools and rascals. Because //Vedānta-sūtra// is very difficult to understand. The compiler, the author of //Vedānta-sūtra,// is Vyāsadeva. He himself thought it wise that "I must leave one commentation of //Vedānta-sūtra.// Otherwise, in future, people will misunderstand and misuse //Vedānta-sūtra.//" In this connection I'll, oh, I may declare herewith that some of you, if you read the Chicago speech by Vivekananda... That was, he was the first man. He came from India to preach this Hindu philosophy in 1893. Some of you know. So he has got his speech, Chicago speech of //Vedānta.// You'll see, it is simply rascaldom. Simply. By his speech it is written... If you can secure, you bring it, you'll see how rascaldom he was. You'll be surprised. Even a clergyman from this country, oh, he was surprised. "Oh, you come from India and you are decrying God in this way? Oh, I'm surprised." He was..., simply he has decried God: "Oh, why do you care for God? Throw Him, God. You are God." In this way, he has spoken.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu, five hundred years before, He knew it that in future the all these rascals will misinterpret //Vedānta-sūtra.// Therefore He presented Himself that "I am fool." //Vedānta-sūtra// is not a very easy thing. Therefore Vyāsadeva, he explained //Vedānta-sūtra// in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The first aphorism of //Vedānta-sūtra// is //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā:// "Now it is the time for understanding what is Brahman." The next //sūtra// is... "What is Brahman?" The next answer is //janmādy asya yataḥ:// "Brahman is that from whom or from where everything emanates." Now he explains //janmādy asya// verse:

> janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ svarāṭ
> tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ
> [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]

In this way, there is lucid explanation of //Vedānta-sūtra.// Now, if you take //Vedānta-sūtra,// this //janmādy asya// aphorism, that Brahman is that Absolute Truth from where everything emanates, or everything is born... //Janma// means, //janma// means born, birth. And //sthiti, sthiti// means maintenance. //Janmādi. Janma sthiti// and //pralaya. Pralaya// means dissolution. This material world, it has got a date of its creation. Just like your body, it has got a date of its creation. It stays for some time, and again there is a date of its dissolution. You take the history of everything material, either you take this body, or take this world, or take any empire or any... Just like your American country, oh, it has a date of its beginning. Now it is staying. Now it will be, some day will come, there will be no more America. You should know it. That means, that is nature's law. Everything. Everything is born, it stays for some time, then it is dissolute, dissolved. That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā, bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate.// All this thing, whatever material, that manifests, it comes out, it is manifested. It... Just like bubbles in the ocean. There are millions and millions bubbles created one second, and next second, it is finished. So //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. But this is the manifestation of material creation. Behind this, the, this spirit is there. Therefore that spirit is Brahman. In this way...

Now, what is the nature of that Brahman? Is it impersonal or personal? Now, Vyāsadeva says, //abhijñaḥ svarāṭ.// No. "That Supreme Truth is cognizant. He knows." And //Bhagavad-gītā// also confirms that, //vedāhaṁ samatītāni// [[books:bg:7:26|[Bg. 7.26]]]. The Lord says, "I know everything. I know..." Unless He's cognizant, unless behind this mani..., cosmic manifestation, if there is no brain, if there is no cognizance, how nicely it can be made so regulation, I mean to say, timely, everything is working? The planets are working. Do you think there is no brain behind this? There must be. Therefore //Bhāgavata// says yes, //abhijñaḥ... Abhijñaḥ// means He's cognizant; He's not a fool. Therefore He's a person. Cognizant is a person. And it is said, //svarāṭ.// He also educated Brahmā. He also... Because Brahmā is considered to be the first created being in this universe. So //Bhāgavata// says, //tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye. Ādi-kavaye// means the first created being, and //brahma// means this Vedic knowledge. So He impregnated Brahmā with Vedic knowledge. So these are the explanation of //Vedānta-sūtra.// But there are so many foolish rascals, they are misusing //Vedānta-sūtra// in a different way. Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very cunningly represented Himself that "I am a fool. I am a rascal. Therefore My Guru Mahārāja, My spiritual master, chastised Me, that 'You rascal, You fool, You cannot understand //Vedānta-sūtra.// You better take this. That will make You happy.' " Or, in other words, at the present moment, the circumstances are so awkward that it is not possible to understand //Vedānta.// If you indulge in //Vedānta-sūtra,// it will be very difficult for you. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu's contribution: //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. "Just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." That will make you everything progressive. //Mūrkha tumi, tomāra nāhika vedāntādhikāra.// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu is representing Himself as the chief man of the fools and rascals, and He says that "My Guru Mahārāja, My spiritual master, ordered Me that 'You better chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will make You happy and progressive. That will make You one day understand what is //Vedānta.//' " //'Kṛṣṇa-mantra' haite habe saṁsāra-mocana.//

Now one may question, "Oh, //Vedānta-sūtra,// understanding //Vedānta-sūtra,// one is liberated from this material entanglement. So you are asking me simply to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa? Will that purpose be served?" Oh, His guru said, "Yes, it will be served." He said, //kṛṣṇa-mantra haite habe saṁsāra-mocana:// "If You go on, continue this Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, there will be a day when You come to the perfectional stage. Then You will be liberated." The same result as one gets out of studying //Vedānta// philosophy or Sāṅkhya philosophy, the same result also you will get by simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇa-nāma haite pābe kṛṣṇera caraṇa.// "Not only that, the Vedantists, sometimes they cannot reach up to the Kṛṣṇa planet. But Your advantage will be that You'll not only be liberated, but You will be achieving the highest planet, planetary kingdom, or the kingdom of God, You'll be able to achieve there." And //nāma vinu. Nāma vinu kali-kāle nāhi āra dharma.// Now Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained that, "This Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa is the only universal religious principle in this age." No other religion process will be effective because people are so many and diverted in different way. This is the common formula and this is the effective formula. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //nāma vinu kali-kāle:// "Without chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa, there is no other alternative for self-realization in this age of Kali."

> nāma vinu kali-kāle nāhi āra dharma
> sarva-mantra-sāra nāma, ei śāstra-marma

Now the essence of all scripture is this Hare Kṛṣṇa. Essence. //Sarva-śāstra-marma// means essence of all scripture. And //sarva-mantra-sāra.// And there are different kinds of hymns and //mantras,// and this is the, I mean to say, topmost part of all //mantras.// "In this way, My Guru Mahārāja asked Me to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa."

//Eta bali' eka śloka śikhāila more.// [break] ...dogmatic or dictator. Because one cannot be a guru or spiritual master if he creates something. No. He cannot create. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says to Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī that "My Guru Mahārāja, My spiritual master, has reason." Why? What is that reason? //Kaṇṭhe kari' ei śloka kariha vicāre:// "My Guru Mahārāja said, he gave Me one verse from authoritative Vedic literature, and he asked Me that 'You should always keep this verse within Your,' " what is called, " 'throat.' " That means, keeping in throat means... And what is that? This is a quotation from the Vedic literature, //Bṛhad-nāradīya Purāṇa.// There are four //Vedas,// and the, there are supplementary //Vedas// also. There are eighteen //purāṇas.// So one of the //purāṇas// is called //Bṛhad-nāradīya Purāṇa.// So in that //Bṛhad-nāradīya Purāṇa,// this quotation is there:

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

"In this age of Kali..." //Kali// means disagreement, quarrel and misunderstanding. This is Kali-yuga, misguiding and, I mean to say, less intelligence, less merciful, living for short period. There are so many disqualifications in this age. So therefore, in the //Bṛhad-nāradīya Purāṇa// it is explicitly stated that,

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

//Kalau// means in this age of Kali there is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative. Thrice. Just like, when you want to stress upon some point, you say thrice: "Do this. Do this. Do this." Similarly, in the //Bṛhad-nāradīya Purāṇa,// thrice it has been emphasized that you must take to this //harer nāma,// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. Why I must take it? Now, because there is no other alternative than this for your self-realization. If you at all want to know yourself, if you at all want to become perfect or, if you want, at all, to reach the goal of human life, then you must, you must, you must. "So My Guru Mahārāja..." Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that "My Guru Mahārāja, My spiritual master, asked Me to 'Keep this verse within Your throat and You go on chanting and I bless You that You will be liberated. You'll not only be liberated, but You shall also reach the highest goal, the Kṛṣṇa planet.' "

So we shall explain further tomorrow. Any question? [end]
