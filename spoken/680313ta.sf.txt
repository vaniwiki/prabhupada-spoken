====== Talk in Studio ======

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this maker, the trademark?

**Gargamuni:**
Concord.

**Prabhupāda:**
Concord, yes. Concord is famous tape recorder company. [tapping microphone] It is all right?

**Yamunā:**
Oh yes, Swamiji. It can also, it can be an amplification system.

**Gargamuni:**
See, if you talk... [feedback]

**Yamunā:**
The thing is they're too close to one another so there's a feedback. You have to be twelve feet away. Then it will amplify. That's what we were using in all of our speaking engagements.

**Gargamuni:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, it acts as amplifier also? So I'll have to speak from here?

**Gargamuni:**
No.

**Yamunā:**
You don't have to... If all, the two microphones weren't so close, then it would be... We wouldn't have this noise, and you could speak as you like to speak.

**Prabhupāda:**
So Gargamuni wants that prayer? Solo, solo?

**Gargamuni:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You also like that?

**Yamunā:**
Oh. [Prabhupāda chuckles] If it isn't too much energy, Swamiji, that would be very beautiful.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Gargamuni:**
Also, when you used to sing in New York, //Vande 'Haṁ,// you would add on //Cintāmaṇi. Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, sometimes. You shall, I shall...? I shall pray that?

**Gargamuni:**
Oh yes, that's nice, that one.

**Yamunā:**
What does that mean, Swamiji, that new prayer?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Cintāmaṇi...// That is description of Kṛṣṇaloka.

**Yamunā:**
From the //Brahma-saṁhitā?//

**Gargamuni:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have?

**Yamunā:**
Yes, I have a copy of it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sit down? Why do you keep there?

**Gargamuni:**
So it's not too loud.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [Prabhupāda chants //Cintāmaṇi// and other prayers]
