====== Initiation Ceremony of Viṣṇujana ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nama.//

**Viṣṇujana:**
//Nama.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Om.//

**Viṣṇujana:**
//Om.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Viṣṇu [repeats each word] //pādāya kṛṣṇa preṣṭhāya bhū-tale śrīmate bhaktivedānta svāmin iti nāmine.// You chant beginning from here, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. Then begin again, another. In this way, there are 108. Come this side. Don't cross. Then again chant on this side from this way to this way. Your name is Viṣṇujana. Viṣṇujana. V-i-s-n-u-j-a-n-a. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break---//japa//---break] You have not brought? All right. [break] The brahminical qualifications is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā: satyam śauca śama dama titikṣa ārjavam, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. Those who are actually //brāhmaṇas,// they must be truthful, always clean, inside and outside. Truthful, clean, and controlling the senses, //śama dama,// controlling the mind, controlling the senses, controlling the mind; //śama dama titikṣa,// tolerance, //titikṣa,// tolerance; //ārjavam,// simplicity; and //jñānam,// must be profoundly wise; //vijñānam,// practical application in life; //jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyam,// full faith in scriptures and in God, or Kṛṣṇa, //āstikyam. Brahma-karma svabhāva-jam:// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]] "These are natural duties, or work, of a //brāhmaṇa.//"

And in the //Bhagavad-gītā// you will find in another place, //cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. "These four classes of classification of the society, it is made by Me." That means this classification of society in the human society, that is made by God. What is that classification? The //brāhmaṇa,// the //kṣatriya,// the //vaiśya,// and the //śūdra.// It is not the name, but it is //guṇa-karma.// Brāhmaṇa means quality and work. //Kṣatriya// means quality and work. And //vaiśya// means quality and work. There is no question of birthright. It is a false proposition that a //brāhmaṇa's// son becomes //brāhmaṇa.// No, not necessarily. If he properly becomes initiated under the guidance of a spiritual master, then he is //brāhmaṇa.// Otherwise, if he has acquired the qualities of a //śūdra,// then he should be considered as a //śūdra.// These are the śāstric injunctions. And this classification is all over the world. Don't think that it is Indian or Vedic system. No. In every country, in every place, in every planet, these four divisions are there.

//Brāhmaṇas// means those who are interested in spiritual life, they are called //brāhmaṇas,// intelligent class. They are called intelligent class, because unless one is intelligent, he will simply consider that this body is he, identification of the body. That is foolishness. //Brāhmaṇas// means //brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.// One who knows that "I am //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,//" and he has actually realized that "I am not this body, I am pure spirit self." It is not the question of Hindu, Muslim. Anyone. Anyone who knows this knowledge, that "I am the self," and acts in that way, he is a //brāhmaṇa.// So these initiation formalities are there. You are instructed, you are guided, but you have to act. Unless you act, then the same thing as in India---the so-called //brāhmaṇas// and //kṣatriyas// are degraded. There will be no meaning. So //guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. You have to stick to the brahminical qualities, and at the same time work. //Brahma-karma. Brahman// is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the last word of //Brahman.// So you have to engage yourself, //brahma-karma,// means Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And exhibit your quality, that you are truthful, you are controlling control over the senses, control over the mind, and you are simple, and you are tolerant. Because as soon as you take up spiritual life, the whole class conducted by //māyā,// they will be against you. That is //māyā's// influence. Somebody will criticize. Somebody will do this, somebody will do that, but we shall... We have to become tolerant. This is the disease of this material world. If anyone becomes spiritually advanced, the agents of māyā will criticize. So therefore you have to become tolerant. And simple, simplicity. //Ārjavam, titikṣa ārjavam,// and //jñāna,// and you must be fully equipped with knowledge. The //Bhagavad-gītā// is there, the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata// is there. Now we are publishing other books also, //Teachings of Lord Caitanya.// So read them. These three or four books, if you read, you become fully qualified with knowledge. And //vijñānam,// and apply them in your practical life. And //āstikyam,// in full faith of the procedures and in Kṛṣṇa. That will make you successful. All right. Get up. [//japa//] [break] Come forward. Now you keep your //mālikā, mālā,// down. You have to offer it.[?] [knocking noises] Take little, this. //Nama.//

**Devotees:**
//Nama.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Apavitraḥ.// Not like that. Do like this.

**Devotee:**
Each can take a little in their right hand.

**Prabhupāda:**
Each time, when I say "//svāhā//" three times, you'll..., Little bit. [devotees chant responsively]

> oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bahyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine

//Svāhā. Vande aham śrī-guroḥ śrī-yuta-pada-kamalam...// [ceremony continues---//kīrtana//] [end]
