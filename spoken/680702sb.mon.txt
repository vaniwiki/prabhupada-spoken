====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.9.8 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

This is Prahlāda Mahārāja praying. Prayers of Prahlāda Mahārāja is very important, most glorious prayer of Prahlāda Mahārāja. This is after the death of his father, Hiraṇyakaśipu. When Lord Nṛsiṁha appeared, half lion, half man, with terrible sounds, very gigantic form, and within a second He finished that gigantic demon Hiraṇyakaśipu, the whole world became afraid. Even Lakṣmījī, constant companion of Lord Viṣṇu, she also became afraid. When all the demigods assembled there, Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, and Indra, and many other denizens of higher planets, they came to see why the Lord is so angry, and they tried to pacify Him. But He was still roaring just like a lion. He was roaring because he could not tolerate that "My devotee has been so much tortured, this little boy, five years old. Simply for the reason that he is Kṛṣṇa conscious, only for this fault, this rascal has tortured him so much." So everyone was afraid. Nobody could pacify Him. At that time Brahmā... He is the supreme living entity of this universe. So intelligently, he pushed forward Prahlāda Mahārāja, "My dear boy, you just try to pacify your Lord, because the Lord has appeared to protect you, for you only. So we could not pacify Him. I think if you go forward and pray and pacify the Lord, He may agree." That is a fact.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja, he was not afraid. That will be explained in these verses, that when Lord asked him, "My dear Prahlāda, are you afraid by seeing My, these features?" He replied, "My dear Lord, I am not at all afraid, but I am afraid of this material existence." That is very nice explanation; we shall come. Now, he says humbly... Vaiṣṇava is always humble. He did not think that "Oh, all other demigods failed to pacify the Lord. Now it is my turn, so how great I am, that I am superceding all these great demigods." So this is the Vaiṣṇava devotee's temperament, humble and meek. They, although they are always in the exalted position, they never advertise that "I am in exalted position." He is never puffed up. As you have read it, the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// such a great devotee, who could produce in his ripe old age such nice transcendental literature, which is certified by my Guru Mahārāja as the postgraduate study of the devotees... So //Bhagavad-gītā// is the study for the neophytes, those who are inquiring, those who are trying to understand the science of God, for them. That means it is primary study. And after studying //Bhagavad-gītā,// just like the boys, after passing the school final examination, they are allowed to enter into the degree college, similarly, one who has understood //Bhagavad-gītā// very nicely and taken up the instruction, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], such person is eligible to enter into the study of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// He accepts Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is a preliminary qualification.

The beginning of devotional service is to accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme. In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is also said that what is the beginning of devotional life. He has explained that //śraddhā.// Devotion means... The Sanskrit word is //śraddhā,// devotion, affection, affinity, attachment. So... Or faith. The faith word is generally understood. So what sort of faith? There are different kinds of faith. But //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// Kṛṣṇa dāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, he says that strong faith, not ordinary faith. Strong faith. What sort of strong faith? He has explained, //śraddhā śābde viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya:// [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]] "That faith means unflinching faith without any deviation, with full understanding." What is that understanding? //Kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya:// "One who engages himself in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, it is to be understood that he has seen all activities of auspicity." That means he has already finished or passed the examination of pious activities. //Kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya.// This is the beginning. Unless one takes it firmly that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead..." And if anyone is engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa, then it is to be understood that he has done all pious activities. This is this faith, this kind of faith, unflinching faith. When we have got this unflinching faith, that is the beginning of //Bhāgavata// life. //Bhāgavata// life means devotional life, direct connection with the Supreme God. That is //Bhāgavata// life.

So after one has got this unflinching faith, that "Simply by serving Lord Kṛṣṇa, all religious activities or all pious activities are done," that faith is the last word of //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā// is explained to Arjuna in so many ways. But ultimately, he comes to the point through Him Himself. When He explains the yoga system, He explains nicely the process, how to execute yoga performances, the sitting posture, the breathing posture and eating and sitting and place. Everything explained nicely. But at the end He says that,

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

"Of all the yogis, one who is always thinking of Me, Kṛṣṇa, within his heart, he is first-class yogi." Similarly, when He explains about //jñāna// system, or philosophical speculation, He summarizes at the end, //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate:// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]] "After many, many births of philosophical speculation, when the learned scholar or philosopher comes to this point..." What is that point? //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate:// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]] "After many, many births' philosophical speculation, when one actually becomes scholar or wise, he surrenders unto Vasudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Why? //Vāsudeva sarvam iti:// "Because He is everything." This is the end of knowledge, when one understands that Vasudeva is everything. Similarly, //yoga-pantha,// the process of yoga, the process of //jñāna,// and the process of //karma,// fruitive activity. What is that? He summarizes in the //Bhagavad-gītā, yat karoṣi yad juhoṣi yad aśnāsi yat tapasyasi kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam// [[books:bg:9:27|[Bg. 9.27]]]. There are different kinds of activities. So Kṛṣṇa says "Whatever you do, it doesn't matter." If somebody says that "I am a businessman," "That's all right." "What is to be done?" "Now, you do business to your best capacity, but the profit give to Me. The profit is Mine." If you agree, then simply by doing business you become a great devotee. The same example: just like Arjuna. He is a fighter. So how he became so great devotee? By fighting. By fighting for whom? For Kṛṣṇa. "No. He fought for getting the kingdom." No, he did not fight for getting the kingdom. He said, "Better I shall forego. I don't want this kingdom by fighting with my relatives." He was very good man. But he agreed to fight for Kṛṣṇa. He changed his decision. Similarly, any work, if you do for Kṛṣṇa, that is //bhakti.// Don't think that //bhakti// means simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and sitting down in one place. No. //Bhakti// means all kinds of activities. God is all-pervading; therefore //bhakti// is also all-pervading. From all spheres of life the devotional service can be done.

So these things are taught, those who are attached to work, for them; those who are attached to philosophy, for them; those who are attached to yoga system, for them; and those who are devotees, for them it is certainly. So from all angles of vision, when one comes to the point that //kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya,// if one is engaged in the transcendental loving service of Kṛṣṇa, then everything is perfect. That is the conclusion of //Bhāgavata. Svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. You... How you can test that the particular engagement in which you are occupied, whether it is successful or not? How it is to be tested? The //Bhāgavata// gives you the formula. What is that, the formula? Now, //saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. You just try to see whether by your work Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, has become satisfied. If you see that He is satisfied, then whatever work you are doing, either you are philosopher or a businessman or a scientist, or anything, politician... There are so many occupational duties. But you have to test whether that is giving you real perfection. That test is that you have to see whether by your activity the Supreme Lord is satisfied. Then... This is a great science. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness science. Simply... Therefore we have to take shelter of an expert. Just like a student goes to a school, and if he works on exercises and he puts before the teacher, and if the teacher says, "Yes, it is good," then he is successful; similarly, //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet:// [MU 1.2.12] you have to approach to a guru or representative of Kṛṣṇa, and if he says, "It is all right," then you know that Kṛṣṇa is satisfied. //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ.// You have to approach such a person whose certificate will ensure that Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied. You have to find out such person. Then your life is success. That will also... You will get according to your sincerity of purpose because Kṛṣṇa is within you.

So after understanding //Bhagavad-gītā,// if one becomes faithful that "I shall devote my life for service of Kṛṣṇa," then he is eligible to enter into the study of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// That means //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// begins from the point where //Bhagavad-gītā// ends. //Bhagavad-gītā// ends at the point: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], one has to surrender fully unto Kṛṣṇa, giving up all other engagements. Always remember, all other engagement means not that you have to give up. You... Try to understand that Kṛṣṇa said that "You give up everything and surrender unto Me." So that does not mean that Arjuna gave up his fighting capacity. Rather, he took to fighting more vigorously. So "Give up all other engagement" means don't take the fruit of your engagement. Give up. Just sacrifice the fruit of the engagement. That is to be given to Kṛṣṇa. This is surrender. Just like a good boy surrenders to his father means whatever he earns, the money, at the end of month he puts in the hand of the father: "Oh, this is my month's earnings"; similarly, we have to sacrifice the fruits of our labor to Kṛṣṇa. This is the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

And to develop that Kṛṣṇa consciousness, just like when you have passed preliminary examination in the school, then you have to further enlightenment, further progress of advancement of education, you enter into the college, degree college, similarly, after finishing or understanding //Bhagavad-gītā// very nicely, if you are convinced about Kṛṣṇa, then study //Bhagavad-gītā [Bhāgavatam],// where the beginning is: //namo bhagavate vaṣudeva.// Vyāsadeva begins by surrendering himself to Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa. //Bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. He is the origin of everything. Then //Bhāgavata// begins. And one who has understood //Bhāgavata,// or he has made his relationship well established with Kṛṣṇa and is functioning in that relationship, then he is passed on the subject matter of //Bhāgavata,// and then you begin //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// That is postgraduate study. After getting your degree, as you try for your Ph.D. or M.A., similarly, //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// is like that, post-graduate study. And the author of the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// he places himself that "I am lower than the worm in the stool." Just see how humble. This is the nature of Vaiṣṇava. That is not artificial. He says. Every Vaiṣṇava thinks himself as very insignificant. Actually, every one of us is very insignificant in comparison to the Supreme Lord. What we are? Nothing. But if we establish our loving relationship, which is already there, then we will become the greatest. By relationship with the greatest, we become the greatest.

So artificially, if we become puffed up, "I am God," we shall always remain in the position of a dog. We shall never be God. But actually if we feel ourselves humble and meek servants of God, then we become more than God. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He keeps His devotees more honorable than Himself. And He recommends to the devotees that //mad-bhakta-pūjābhyadhikā:// [SB 11.19.21] "My dear devotees, take it for granted that if you worship My devotees, that is more than My devotional service." Kṛṣṇa recommends, and actually that is the fact, that Kṛṣṇa is more pleased. Just like... It is very natural. Just like one gentleman he has got a little child, and if you try to please that little child, that gentleman automatically becomes pleased. You can please the child with two-cent-worth lozenges, and if the child is laughing and very pleased, his father immediately becomes pleased. But if you want to please the father, you will require at least two hundred dollars. So you can finish two hundred dollars' business with two cents. Similarly, devotees are so nice that if you give him anything... Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa is also so nice that He will be pleased if anything offer. You offer little water, little flower, little... And devotees are still higher. If you simply offer a devotee a little sweet words, oh, he is very pleased. You see? That is the nature of devotee. Devotee does not want anything from you. They simply want that you... Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, he said... He has got a nice song that "If you simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, oh, I become sold to you." Nityānanda Prabhu also says like that. So to please a devotee is very nice. Therefore our process is to take shelter of a devotee. Directly we don't approach Kṛṣṇa. //Gopī-bhartur pāda-kamalayor dāsa-dāsanudāsa.// Therefore in Vṛndāvana you will see everyone is praising Rādhārāṇī because Rādhārāṇī is very quickly pleased. And as soon as Rādhārāṇī is pleased, Kṛṣṇa is automatically pleased. This is the process.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja, although he is such a great devotee, he says that //kiṁ toṣṭum arhati sa me harir ugra-jāteḥ:// "Oh, I am born of a father, demon." So naturally everyone presents himself in relationship with father. If your father is American, then you say, "I am American." If my father is Indian, I will say, "I am Indian." Similarly, he is born of a demon father, so he is presenting himself that "I am a demon. I am born of a demon father." //Ugra-jāteḥ. Ugra-jāteḥ// means... //Ugra// means violent. Demons are always violent. So "I am born of a violent father. How can I please the Lord? Brahma, Lord Śiva, and so many other demigods, they have failed to please, to pacify the Lord in His angry mood, and I am born a demon, born of a demon father. So my position is so lower." //Kiṁ toṣṭum arhati:// "How can I please the Lord?" //Ugra-jāteḥ. Brahmādayaḥ sura-gaṇāḥ:// "Where demigods like Brahma, //munayo,// great sages, and //siddha...//" Siddhas, they are the particular citizens of Siddhaloka. They are called Siddhas. There is a planet which is called Siddhaloka. There is description in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// of the Siddhaloka in the Second Canto. Siddhaloka is a planet where the inhabitants can fly in the air without any machine, without any airplane. Just like bird can fly in the air without any machine, so the denizens of Siddhaloka, they can also fly in the air without any machine, without any airplane, and they can go from one planet to another. They are called Siddha. Siddha means they have got eight kinds of perfection. The yoga system, those who are practicing yoga, their ultimate goal is to achieve eight kinds of perfection, not that simply exercising, finish. Actual yoga system means to attain eight kinds of perfection. What is that eight kinds of perfection? Oh, he can become the smaller than the smallest. I have several times explained. A perfect yogi, if you put him in lock-up, he will come out. He will become the smaller than the smallest and come out from the lock-up. I have seen it. So he can become greater than the greatest, smaller than the smallest, greater... //Aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti.// He can get anything whatever he likes immediately. //Prāpti-siddhi, prākāmya, īśitā, maśīta.// There are so many kinds of yogic perfections. So these //siddhas,// they can travel from one place to another, even ordinary yogis, those who have perfected. They take bath in the morning in four different pilgrimages in India. That means thousands of thousands of miles away, and they finish it within one hour. They go and take bath, again come back. So these are yogic perfections. They are called //siddhas.//

So all the denizens of that particular planet, they are //siddhas. Siddhas// means they have got all the perfection of yoga practice. So they were also present, offering prayers; Brahmā was present, Lord Śiva was present, and great sages were present. All of them tried to pacify. And how they wanted to pacify? //Sattvaikatāna-gatayo vacasāṁ pravāhaiḥ:// They were very great learned men. Immediately they began to compose in Sanskrit verses so many nice prayers, and they were all full of goodness, modes of goodness. //Sattvaikatāna-vacasāṁ pravāhaiḥ. Pravāhaiḥ// means they prayed in such a fluent way, just like the river flows down without any gheck. That is the learned man. Just like a learned man will speak fluently for hours together, similarly, they were so learned scholars that they composed prayers in Sanskrit so nicely and began to speak just like flow of water. So he says, //sattvaikatāna-gatayo vacasāṁ nārādhituṁ:// "Still, they could not satisfy the Lord." //Nārādhituṁ. Puru-guṇair adhunāpi pipruḥ:// "Still, the Lord is not pacified. Still." //Kiṁ toṣṭum arhati:// "Then what can I do?" Where... There is an English word, "Where angels fail, the fools rush in." So "I am so lower. I am born of an atheistic father, demon. How can I please the Lord?" So this is the position.

So now how he will please the Lord we shall discuss in the next meeting. Thank you. So any questions?

**Devotee:**
Could you say that prayer again of Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, "You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa..."? I didn't understand that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has composed a song that he is going all around the city begging alms. So he says that "I don't want anything from you. Simply you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and that will be satisfactory." So we can do also, following the footprints of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, Nityānanda Prabhu. //Āmāre kiṁlaha, laha gaurāṅgera saṅge...// Nityānanda Prabhu... [end]
