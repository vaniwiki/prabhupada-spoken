====== Initiation ======

[//kīrtana,// etc.]

**Prabhupāda:**
[leads prayers for fire sacrifice] //Vande 'ham..., svāhā.// Why left hand? Right hand. //Svāhā. Svāhā.// [chants standard fire sacrifice prayers with devotees' response] Now stand up with this banana.

> go brahmaṇya-devāya
> go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca
> jagad-dhitāya kṛṣṇāya
> govindāya namo namaḥ

[chants twice with response] Put this banana like this. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. [chants twice with response] Now bow down.

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta svāmin iti nāmine

All right.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya. Jaya.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now you chant. You chant. Hare Kṛṣṇa, chant.

**Young woman:**
Excuse me please. I have to speak to you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Please wait. Let me finish. Let me finish.

**Viṣṇujana:**
You don't have to speak to him.

**Young woman:**
Yes I do. You are sitting up there and all of these people are sitting here, and you're like you're on a throne. And you're feeling...

**Viṣṇujana:**
No.

**Young woman:**
Pardon? No, this is wrong.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Let us chant. [//kīrtana-prema-dhvanī//] Where is that girl? She is gone?

**Viṣṇujana:**
I think Madhudviṣa explained to her. She did not know about the bowing down and everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
What was her question?

**Viṣṇujana:**
She was thinking that we were bowing to you as if you were God. She resents this, because in the Christian religion it says, "Bow down to no man."

**Prabhupāda:**
What did you explain?

**Viṣṇujana:**
I don't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Did you not explain that we are bowing down not as God, as God's representative? Did you..., could not explain like this?

**Madhudviṣa:**
She's over there, I think, if you'd like to talk to her.

**Viṣṇujana:**
You can explain that to her.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, you'd better... You explain it to her. It might be better than her coming here and blaspheming.

**Prabhupāda:**
Call her. Call her. Call her. [pause] [talking in background, initiates discussing their names, etc.] Distribute //prasādam.// Everyone. Outside also?

**Upendra:**
Prabhupāda? Tomorrow between 12:15 for a lecture at the University.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the arrangement?

**Upendra:**
It is one small auditorium. It seats seventy people. They have advertised on the university and in the newspaper at the university. So we have no idea who will come, but they have advertised.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you will be able to collect?

**Upendra:**
Indiscreetly. We will ask as they leave. [end]
