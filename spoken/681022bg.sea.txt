====== Bhagavad-gītā 3.8–11 ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So we were discussing that everybody should work.

> niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ
> karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ
> śarīra-yātrāpi ca te
> na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ
> [[books:bg:3:8|[Bg. 3.8]]]

> yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra
> loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ
> tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya
> mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara
> [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]

Now, this is the formula of spiritual realization, that we should not stop our working capacities, the prescribed duties in which we are engaged. That is not to be stopped. If we stop work and spiritual realization, for spiritual realization we leave this world and go to the jungle or Himalaya and sit down there for meditation, for spiritual realization, oh, how many people will be ready to do this thing? No. This is not for mass people. Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is prescribing something practical which can be adopted by everyone and all without any distinction. This point we have already discussed in the last day's meeting, that whatever you may be, it doesn't matter. You can realize the highest perfection of life provided you work under the regulation of //yajña. Yajñārthāt karmaṇaḥ.// There is no harm working, but the work should be done for the Supreme Lord, //Yajña. Yajña// means Viṣṇu. Because according to laws of nature, any work you do, it has got some reaction, and we are bound up by those reactions. //Vedas// also says, //karmaṇā baddhyate jantuḥ. Karmaṇā baddhyate jantuḥ,// that "All living entities, they are bound up in this material encagement on account of their different kinds of //karma,// or work." But here is the point, that you shall not be bound up by the reaction of your //karma// if you act it on behalf of Yajña or Viṣṇu or the Supreme Lord. That is prescription. //Yajñārthāt karmaṇaḥ anyatra// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. //Anyatra.// If you do not work for that supreme purpose, then you will be bound up and your this encagement of body will continue. This encagement of body will continue if you work on your own responsibility and not for the supreme purpose or the Supreme Lord Yajña, or Viṣṇu. That is the secret. Yajña means //yajña vai viṣṇu iti śrute. Śrute. Śrute// means the Vedic literatures, the Vedic hymns. They prove it. Yajña means Viṣṇu. //Viṣṇus tu sārthaṁ karma samācara.// Therefore we have to work for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu. That is called //yajña.//

> saha-yajñāḥ prajāḥ sṛṣṭvā
> purovāca prajāpatiḥ
> anena prasaviṣyadhvam
> eṣa vo 'stv iṣṭa-kāma-dhuk
> [[books:bg:3:10|[Bg. 3.10]]]

The proof of this sacrifice, //yajña,// is mentioned in the Vedic scripture. After the creation it was so announced that "If you want to be happy, you must perform sacrifices." Sacrifices.

The Vedic literature is created for guidance of the conditioned souls. Every living being who is in this material world is conditioned by the laws of material nature. And it is a chance. This creation, and especially this human body, is a chance to get rid of this material entanglement, and the chance is open by acting for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu. //Saha-yajñāḥ prajāḥ sṛṣṭvā. Prajāḥ. Prajāḥ// means the living entities. After being created, they were advised that "You perform //yajña,// or sacrifice for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu." That will... //Anena,// "by this," //prasaviṣyadhvam,// "you increase your enlightenment." //Prasaviṣyadhvam.// "And whatever you want, that will be satisfied by this //yajña." Devān... Yajña,// that sacrifice.

> Devān bhāvayatānena
> te devā bhāvayantu vaḥ
> parasparaṁ bhāvayantaḥ
> śreyaḥ param avāpsyatha
> [[books:bg:3:11|[Bg. 3.11]]]

Now, //yajña// is practically, according to the Vedic rituals, //yajña,// or sacrifice, is offered to different //devas,// demigods. There are hundreds and thousands of demigods mentioned in the Vedic literatures. And the whole portion is called //upāsanā-kāṇḍa. Upāsanā-kāṇḍa// means worshiping different demigods. But what are these demigods? The demigods are just like different parts of the whole body of the Supreme Lord. They are, so to say, just like the government of the king. There is one king, but there are many state officers.

Just you can imagine that if for management of a city like New York, you have got so many departments. As soon as we go to these chambers, we get so many departments: criminal department, civil department, and so many departments. So for management of these universal affairs, there are different departments also, so far we can get information from the Vedic literature. And each department, there is a particular director. And Brahmā is considered to be supreme director of this universe. So this //yajña,// sacrifice, Vedic rituals, they are indicated to pay different taxes to different demigods. But the Supreme Lord is above all. Therefore, if one performs sacrifice for the Supreme Lord, he is immune from other obligations. That is also mentioned.

> devarṣi-bhūtāpta-nṛṇāṁ pitṝṇāṁ
> na kiṅkaro nāyam ṛṇī ca rājan
> sarvātmanā yaḥ śaraṇaṁ śaraṇyaṁ
> gato mukundaṁ parihṛtya kartam
> [SB 11.5.41]

Now, as soon as a living being is born in this material world, he has got many obligations. [incomplete] [end]
