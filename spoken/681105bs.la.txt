====== Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā, Verse 29 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-
> lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
> lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.29]

"I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is the cause of all causes. He is in the //cintāmaṇi-dhāma.//" //Cintāmaṇi-dhāma// means the place which is not made of earth and stone, but they are made of touchstone. Most probably you have heard the name of touchstone. Touchstone can turn iron into gold. So the Lord's abode is made of touchstone, //cintāmaṇi.// There are houses... As we have got our experience here in this world that houses are made of bricks, there, in the transcendental world, the houses are made of this //cintāmaṇi// stone, touchstone. //Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa// [Bs. 5.29]. There are also trees, but those trees are not like this tree. The trees are //kalpa-vṛkṣa.// Here you can take one kind of fruit from one tree, but there, from the trees you can ask anything, and you get it because those trees are all spiritual. That is the difference between matter and spirit. //Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa lakṣā-vṛteṣu// [Bs. 5.29]. Such kind of trees, there are many, not one or two. All the places are covered by all those trees. //Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam.// And the Lord is very much fond of cowherding. And the cows there, they are called //surabhīs. Surabhī// cow means you can milk as many times and as much as you like. //Surabhīr abhipālayantam.// And //lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ// [Bs. 5.29]. And the Lord is always surrounded by the goddesses of fortune, //lakṣmī-sahasra-śata,// not one or two, but hundreds and thousands, hundreds and thousands of goddesses of fortune, they are always serving the Lord. And in this way, eternally, blissfully, the Lord is staying in His abode, which is called //cintāmaṇi-dhāma.// [aside:] Now, how to stop this? [end]
