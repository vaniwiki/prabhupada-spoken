====== Talk Before Class ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Who has taken your Deity?

**Vīrabhadra:**
Who has taken Him? I don't know. Somebody, they broke in the house, they took one typewriter and the sewing machine and I think it's...

**Prabhupāda:**
Typewriter? When?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Last night. Yesterday we just got a new sewing machine. A very expensive sewing machine and they stole it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sewing machine?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And a typewriter. It was taken from the house.

**Revatīnandana:**
While we were at Griffith Park with //kīrtana// party they broke into our house and took it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that quarter is not nice?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, it's not a nice quarter. So we'll take more precautions now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Somebody must remain always. That is the only precaution.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
O.K. Yes, that's what I was thinking.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think in our apartment also somebody must remain. Here this is... In New York also I lost my typewriter, tape recorder. In 72nd St. at daytime, at nine o'clock. I went to take my meals in Dr. Miṣra's place at about nine, and when I came back I saw the door is broken. That superintendent, he was a Negro. He has done, I know that. This is very common case here. You purchased new machine and new...?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The tape recorder... I mean the sewing machine was Śīlavatī's. She has sent it down here with Dinesh. Two or three hours before I had just gotten it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Your tape recorder also?

**Dineśa:**
No. I had brought the sewing machine from Śīlavatī in San Francisco. Yes. This sewing machine.

**Prabhupāda:**
And typewriter, whose?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The typewriter was mine. I'd just... Puruṣottama had just brought it from New York from my parents to me. So less than a week and they both are gone.

**Prabhupāda:**
New typewriter?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, it was practically new. It was a very good typewriter.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the maker?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Olivetti. It's the portable.

**Prabhupāda:**
Olivetti portable.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. A good one. But the sewing machine is very expensive. It may be 150 dollars. 163 dollars. Very good.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we have to take care. What can be done? Now you should be very careful, and somebody must remain there always.

**Govinda:**
We live in a very good quarter though. They live by Watts and that's the... They live by Watts district, and Watts district is very notorious. There were seven-day riots of shooting and Negro revolts there about two years ago, three years ago. We live in a very nice quarter, but where they're living is in a very bad place.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you will continue to live there?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, it's in La Palma. It's not directly in the worst area. It's not in Watts county. It's in a different area, but still... Where you live is very good though. I don't think there would be any theft. More safe.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It appears very respectable quarter. All right. Read. [end]
