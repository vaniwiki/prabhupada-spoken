**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's all right. Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [//japa//] [break]

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine

[devotees repeat]

**Pradyumna:**
Joṭilā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Your name is Joṭilā. Yes. Joṭilā and Kutilā. Joṭilā was the mother-in-law of Rādhārāṇī. [chuckles] Yes. Kṛṣṇa was not Rādhārāṇī's husband. Her husband is supposed to be somebody else. Come on. Come on. And you have bowed down? That is done. Come on. That's all right. So ten kinds of offenses, all those who are initiated today, they should avoid ten kinds of offenses. What are those offenses?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"One: Blaspheming the Lord's devotee. Two: Considering the Lord and other demigods on the same level or assuming there are many gods. Three: Neglecting the orders of the spiritual master. Four: Minimizing the authority of the //Vedas.// Five: Interpreting the holy names of God. Six: Committing sin on the strength of chanting."

**Prabhupāda:**
This is very dangerous thing. By chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// you become released from all sinful reaction. But because Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// nullifies all sinful reaction, that does not mean he shall continue. It is not like that, you go to church and you confess your sins and it is all adjusted or nullified---again from the next week you begin fresh sinful activities. No. That is not allowed. That is not allowed. Kṛṣṇa we should not make an agent for nullifying our sinful activities. Then it is not service. Then we make Kṛṣṇa as our servant. We are at liberty to commit all kinds of nonsense, and God becomes an agent to clear it---what is this nonsense? That is not allowed. You may, by mistake or some way or other, you may commit something wrong, but by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, from this day everything is //apavitraḥ pavitro vā,// everything is finished. But from tomorrow or immediately after this, no more sinful activities. Therefore this regulative principle, these four principles: illicit sex, meat-eating, and intoxication, and gambling. These four principles are the basic principles of all sinful activities. If you indulge in these four things, then you are prepared to do any nonsense. Therefore these four things should be immediately stopped; then there is no more chance of sinful activities. And chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, you keep yourself always purified. //Māyā// will not touch you and you shall be elevated to the eternal blissful life to enjoy like the //gopīs.// That's all.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should I read the four others, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Seven: Instructing the Lord's name to the unfaithful."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this initiation is not canvassing. We don't canvass that "You become our disciple." Anyone who understands, "Oh, this is very nice," if he comes, "Swamijī, initiate me," he is welcome. But there is no canvassing or selling the //mantra.// No. We have no such business. We give everyone freedom to hear this chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// without any charges. We go from door to door, street to street: "Hear and be purified." And if anyone wants to be intimately associated with us, we welcome. But we don't canvass. That is no use. If I artificially ask somebody that "You become initiated and...," no, that will not stand. One must willingly come. Therefore, as a general principle, we distribute this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// But if we find somebody reluctant, then we become callous. We don't mind. There are many others. Then?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Eight: Comparing the holy name to material piety."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Now this function, this ceremony which is going on, it is not a material ceremony. Material ceremony, of course... Just like in our country there are so many //pūjās, satyanārāyaṇa-kathā,// like that. Their aim is to gain some material profit. So that kind of function is not this initiation. Here there is no question of gaining any material profit. Here the process is to become purified and become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. That is the aim. Not that "By initiation, by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, now my income is one hundred dollars. I will get one thousand dollars." No. There is no question of dollar calculation. It is no mammon's philosophy. It is real Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy. So then next?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
"Nine: Inattentive while chanting the holy name."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. When you chant, you must hear also. This is attention. This is yoga. Your mind must be engaged to the vibration, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." You are thinking of something in factory, what is going on, and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. No. Not that. The chanting must be heard by you. That is attention, with attention. Yes, go on.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Last, "Ten: Attachment to material things while engaged in the practice of chanting."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. If by chanting, you see that your love for Kṛṣṇa is increasing and your love for matter and material enjoyment is decreasing, then you must know that you are progressing. If, by the result of chanting, you are increasing your material hankering, that is not progress. Then that is an offense. One should know that "Now I am chanting with offense. I have to rectify it." You have to test whether you are increasing your love of God, Kṛṣṇa. Then you should know that you are in progress. Two things cannot go. Just like hunger and eating cannot go together. If you are actually eating, then hunger must be subsided, if you are actually eating. Similarly, if you are actually making spiritual progress, then the result will be that your material hankering will decrease, not that you are being cured, and the temperature is increasing. No. If you are actually being cured the temperature must decrease. If you are in feverish condition, you are taking medicine, then the fever must decrease. This material hankering is a kind of disease. It is never satisfied. But people are hankering more, more, more, more, more... That means temperature is increasing. And when the temperature is 107 degrees, finish life. That's all.

So this material civilization has come to the degree of atomic heat, you see. Now everyone has got this atomic energy, and it is going to be finished. So that kind of advancement is not needed. Actually //bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. The test... Whether you are making progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness you have to test yourself, whether you are decreasing your material desires. That's all. Because in the perfect stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no more material desires. //Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce:// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]] "I have no more any demand. I am fully satisfied." //Kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma ataeva śānta// [[books:cc:madhya:19:149|[Cc. Madhya 19.149]]]. If you want //śānti,// peacefulness, then you have to become completely Kṛṣṇa conscious-//kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma//---because he has no more demand. And //bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kāmī sakali aśānta.// And those who are //karmīs,// trying to elevate material position, they are all disturbed. And //mukti,// those who are hankering after liberation, he is also disturbed. And //siddhi,// those who are yogis hankering after some material perfection, mystic perfection, he is also disturbed. He is simply thinking, "How I shall be so light that I can fly in the sky." Yes. What you are? There are... So many flies are flying in the sky. [laughter] What you gain by that? But the nonsense will see, "Oh, I am now, from the ground I am now three feet high." Three feet high? A small bird is a hundred feet high. What is there? These are all nonsense. Don't be after all this nonsense. //Bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kāmī. Bhukti// means these ordinary worker, whole day working like ass, taking a morsel of food or no food even, but working hard. Always motorcar is going this way, that way, that way, that way, and that way, that way... They are //karmīs.// And those who are disgusted with //karma//---"Now I shall meditate. I shall become God." You see? The same disease, //aśānti.// And //siddhi-kāmī,// mystic power: "I shall be light. I shall be great. Whatever I shall want, immediately..." The yogis can do that.

As I told you, one story, it is very..., not amusing. One boy, he went out of home and mixed with yogis for several years. Then, after some time, he came to his village, and all the friends and relatives gathered: "Oh, you have been so many years with yogis. What you have learned?" Actually yogis can do wonderful things. One yogi used to come to our house. He was my father's... My father used to respect him. So he told us that within a few minutes they will go several hundreds of miles. Simply he will touch his Guru Mahārāja and sit down, and he will see in another place within few seconds some thousands of miles away. The yogis can perform this. So one yogi, he came to his village, and all the people, relatives, surrounded him: "What you have learned, please?" He said that "I have learned this mystic power; I can walk on the water." This is called //laghima-siddhi,// to become so light that one can fly in the air or one can walk on the water. So everyone became inquisitive. "Oh, please show me. Please show us one day." So he agreed, "All right. I shall show on that day." Then one old man said, "My dear friend, you have been so long with the yogis, but you have learned only two-cent-worth power." "What is that?" "Now you will walk over the water, and I shall pay two cent to the boatman. He will take me to the other side. [laughter] So what you have gained? You have so much labored, but you have gained only two-cent-worth thing." You see? So these yogis are after two cent. [laughter] Even they are perfection. There is no... If they are perfect... Without being perfect, they are nothing, simply rascals. But even they are perfect, that is two-cent worth. You see? But here is a yoga system---we are going to Kṛṣṇa. Just always remember this.

So what is the last? So we should not be inattentive. This yoga system, this //bhakti-yoga// system, is the highest yoga system. There is... Even Brahmā. You'll read all these thing in our book, //Kṛṣṇa.// Brahmā, he was so powerful. He wanted to play some mystic power. He took away all the cowherds boys and friend, yes, calves and cows from Kṛṣṇa just to see the fun. And Kṛṣṇa created many thousand cowherd boys immediately. So this yogic power has nothing to do. If you can get Kṛṣṇa... Just like Mother Yaśodā and other friends. Just like I told you about Bhadrasena. He was challenging Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa was defeated. And when Kṛṣṇa became defeated, He had to take on His shoulder His friend. So this is another thing. And to be satisfied with little power and little influence within this material world, that is nothing. That is worthless. As soon as this body is finished, everything is finished. It has no value. Just... //Yam labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.// You just try to achieve something, will achieving, you will no more want anything. So all these yogis, all these //karmīs,// all these //jñānīs,// they are not peaceful because they are wanting something, wanting something. So long you will be wanting something, there cannot be any more peace. Mind that. When there will be no more demand, that is peace. And that is only for Kṛṣṇa //bhakta, kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma// [[books:cc:madhya:19:149|[Cc. Madhya 19.149]]], because he has no demand. //Ataeva śānta:// "Therefore he is peaceful." All others, they have got some demand. So this is the process. By making progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness means your demands will be nil. That's all. When you find in that position, that "I have no more any demand," //svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi,// "I am fully satisfied, Kṛṣṇa," then that is your perfection. So try to achieve that position.

Now you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Oh, first of all is marriage. Now you offer this girl. What is name? Where is garland? All these groups, give them garland. Who is in charge? All right. This garland was first touched there in Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
First touched to Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, to the feet. Yes. Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It hasn't been done yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
So do it. Do it immediately. Now you just give in charity these girls to the boys. You say... First of all name her.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jambavatī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, "My Godsister..."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
My Godsister Jambavatī...

**Prabhupāda:**

**Prabhupāda:**
"...now I will give you."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...I now give you to

**Prabhupāda:**
So you accept him as your wife.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Do you accept him as your wife?"

**Prabhupāda:**
You say, "Yes, I accept."

**Devotee (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
"I take charge of her throughout her life." Yes. And you accept, "I accept you as my husband. We shall keep in peace in any circumstances." Tell this. Say this. "We shall keep peace in any circumstances. We shall never be separated even in distressed condition." You also say. Yes.

**Devotee (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now change your garland. That's all. Yes. You come to this side. You come to this side, left side. You go to the right side. Similarly, you give her.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Janmañjaya, this is my Godsister Tārā dāsī. I wish that you will accept her as your wife, to take charge of her.

**Prabhupāda:**
You say, "Yes, I take charge for Tārā dāsī throughout her life." Say that.

**Janmañjaya:**
I will take charge of Tārā dāsī throughout her life.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you say, "I accept you as my husband."

**Tārā:**
I accept you as my husband.

**Prabhupāda:**
"And I wish to serve you throughout my life."

**Tārā:**
And I wish to serve you throughout my life.

**Prabhupāda:**
"There will be no separation in any condition."

**Tārā:**
There will be no separation in any condition.

**Prabhupāda:**
"We shall jointly execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Tārā:**
We shall jointly execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now change [garland]. Change it.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [//japa//]

**Prabhupāda:**
You come this side. You come this side. Left side you come. You come left side. Now cover. Similarly do here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
My dear Godbrother Sūri, this is my Godsister Joṭilā dāsī, and I wish that you will take care of her for your whole life and accept her as your wife and always protect her, that there will be no separation between you, that you will always watch over her carefully. Will you do this?

**Sūri:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You say, "Yes, I take charge of Joṭilā dāsī." You say.

**Sūri:**
Yes, I take charge...

**Prabhupāda:**
[Sūri dāsa repeating] "Throughout her whole life. Throughout her whole life. There will be no separation in any condition. In any condition. And we shall jointly execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Jointly. Jointly. Yes. She will help you, and you will help her. That's all. Change. Yes, you accept that "I will serve you throughout my life."

**Joṭilā:**
Yes, I will serve you throughout my life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Go on. Now change. [break] [devotees repeat:]
