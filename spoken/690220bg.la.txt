====== Bhagavad-gītā 6.35–45 ======

**Devotee:**
Verse thirty-five: "The Blessed Lord said: O mighty armed son of Kuntī, it is undoubtedly very difficult to curb the restless mind, but it is possible by constant practice and by detachment."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Now, Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes." Kṛṣṇa does not say that it is not difficult. Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes, it is difficult." But it is possible by constant practice. This constant practice is to engage oneself in something which reminds as Kṛṣṇa. Do something. Therefore we have so many activities. Not only //kīrtana,// but temple activities, //prasāda// activities, publication activities, so many activities. Everyone is engaged in some activities and Kṛṣṇa is the central point. Therefore a person who is typing for Kṛṣṇa, he is in yoga system. A person who is cooking for Kṛṣṇa, he is in yoga system. A person who is chanting in the street, distributing our literature, he's also in Kṛṣṇa. So by ordinary habits we are engaged, as in our material life we were engaged in so many things. If we mold our life in connection with Kṛṣṇa, then in every activity there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness and therefore this yoga perfection is there automatically. Yes, go on.

**Devotee:**
Verse thirty-six: "For one whose mind is unbridled, self-realization is difficult work. But he whose mind is controlled and who strives by right means is assured of success. That is My judgement." Purport: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead declares that one who does not accept the proper treatment to detach the mind from material engagement can hardly achieve success in self-realization. Trying to practice yoga while engaging the mind in material enjoyment is like trying to ignite a fire while pouring water on it. Similarly yoga practice without mental control is a waste of time."

**Prabhupāda:**
Because I sit down for meditation. Of course if meditation is focusing the mind on Viṣṇu, that is very good. But there are so many yoga societies, they educate their student to concentrate their mind on something void, something color. Not exactly to Viṣṇu form. You see. So that is very difficult task. That is also explained in the //Bhagavad---kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām// [[books:bg:12:5|[Bg. 12.5]]]. One who is trying to concentrate his mind on the imperson or voidness, it is very difficult and troublesome. At least here in this temple, these students, they are trying to concentrate his mind on Kṛṣṇa. But to concentrate one's mind in void, that is very difficult. So naturally my mind is flickering. Instead of finding out something void, my mind is engaged in something else. Because mind must be engaged in something. If it is not engaged in Kṛṣṇa, then it must be engaged in //māyā.// So if you cannot do that, then this so-called meditation and sitting posture is simply useless waste of time. Go on.

**Devotee:**
"Such a show of yoga practice may be materially lucrative, but useless as far as spiritual realization is concerned."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Materially lucrative. Suppose if I open such yoga class and I charge five dollars for sitting. Money is not very rare in your country, you come. But simply I give you some sitting posture or pressing nose and this and that, but if you cannot attain the real, I mean to say, result of yoga practice, then you have wasted your time and money and I have cheated you. That is not possible. That is not possible. One has to concentrate his mind on Viṣṇu form, steady, constantly, that is called //samādhi.// So the same thing is being done in a different manner suitable for this age. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Go on.

**Devotee:**
"Therefore the mind must be controlled by engaging it constantly in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Unless one is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can't steadily control the mind. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person easily achieves the result of yoga practice without separate endeavor. A yoga practitioner cannot achieve perfect success without becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious."

**Prabhupāda:**
Then? Go on. So far yoga practice is concerned is explained, discussion between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. Now, supposing that I practice yoga, real yoga I mean to say, not this pseudo yoga. And if I cannot do it properly, I fail. Then what is the result? Suppose if I give up my business, I give up my ordinary occupation and I begin to practice yoga. But somehow or other it is not completed, it is failure. Then what is the result? That is being questioned by Arjuna. That will be answered by Kṛṣṇa. What is that? Go on. "Arjuna said..."

**Devotee:**
"Arjuna said: 'What is the destination of a man of faith who does not persevere? Who in the beginning takes to the process of self-realization but who later desists due to worldly mindedness and thus does not attain perfection in mysticism?' " Purport: "The path of self-realization of mysticism is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// The basic principle of self-realization is knowledge that the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and his happiness is in eternal life, bliss and knowledge."

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, before coming to the point of self-realization, one must take it granted---that is the beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā,// that he is not this body. That the living entity is not this material body but that he is different from it and his happiness is in eternal life. This life is not eternal. The perfection of yoga system means to get eternal life, blissful life and full of knowledge. That is perfection. So we have to execute any yoga system with that aim. Not that I attend some yoga class to reduce fat or to keep my body very fit for sense gratification. This is not the end of yoga system. But people are taught like that. "Oh, if you practice this yoga system." That you can do if you undergo any exercise process your body will be kept fit. There are so many system of bodily exercise, the system, this weight-lifting system, there are many sporting system, they also keep body very fit. They can digest foodstuff very nicely, they reduce fat. For this purpose there is no need of practicing yoga. The real purpose is here; that to realize that I am not this body. I want eternal happiness, I want complete knowledge, I want eternal life also. That is the ultimate end of yoga system. Go on.

**Devotee:**
"These are transcendental. Beyond both body and mind. Self-realization is sought by the path of knowledge, the practice of eightfold mysticism or by //bhakti-yoga.// In each of these processes one has to realize the constitutional position of the living entity, his relationship with God and the activities whereby he can reestablish the lost link and achieve the highest perfectional stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Following any of the above-mentioned three methods, one is sure to reach the supreme goal sooner or later. This was asserted by the Lord in the Second Chapter. Even a little endeavor on the transcendental path of //bhakti-yoga// is especially suitable for this age because it is the most direct method of God-realization. To be doubly assured, Arjuna is asking Lord Kṛṣṇa to confirm His former statement. One may sincerely adopt the path of self-realization. But the process of cultivation of knowledge and the practice of eightfold yoga system are generally very difficult for this age. Therefore in spite of one's earnest endeavor one may fail for many reasons. The primary reason is one's not being sufficiently serious about following the process. To pursue the transcendental path is more or less to declare war on the illusory energy."

**Prabhupāda:**
When we accept any self-realization process, it is practically declaring war against the illusory energy, //māyā.// So when there's a question of //māyā// or a question of fight or war there will be so many difficulty imposed by //māyā,// that is certain. Therefore there is a chance of failure. but one has to become very steady. Go on.

**Devotee:**
"Consequently whenever a person tries to escape the clutches of the illusory energy, she tries to defeat the practitioner by various allurements. A conditioned soul is already allured by the modes of material energy and there is every chance of being allured again while performing such transcendental practice. This is called //yogāc calita-mānasaḥ.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Calita-mānasaḥ. Calita-mānasaḥ// means diverting the mind from the practice of yoga. //Yogāc calita-mānasaḥ. Yogāt// means from the practice of yoga and //calita// means diversion. //Mānasaḥ// means mind. //Yogāc calita-mānasaḥ.// So there is every chance. Everyone has got experience. You're trying to read some book, concentration, but mind is not allowing, it is disturbed. So it is very important factor to control the mind. That is the real practice.

**Devotee:**
"One who is deviated from the transcendental path. Arjuna is inquisitive to know the results of deviation from the path of self-realization."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is very important question. That one may begin practicing any sort of yoga, either the eightfold yoga system of the //jñāna-yoga// system, means speculating philosophically, and the //bhakti-yoga// system, devotional service. But if one fails to complete the yoga system, what is the result. That is very important question and it is put by Arjuna and Kṛṣṇa will answer it. [break]

**Devotee:**
[6.44] "By virtue of the divine consciousness of his previous life, he automatically becomes attached to the yogic principles---even without seeking them. Such an inquisitive transcendentalist, striving for yoga, stands always above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures. But when the yogi..."

**Prabhupāda:**
No, let me explain this. "By virtue of divine consciousness." We are preparing this consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, divine consciousness. And the consciousness we go. Just like the flavor, the aroma of a rose flower is carried by the air and if the air passes through us we also experience the rose flavor. Similarly, when we die, this material body is finished. "Dust thou art, dust thou beist." This is made of five elements: earth, water, air, fire, ether. So the, so far earthy materials are concerned, that is mixed up. Somebody burns this body, somebody buries or somebody throws it for being eaten by the animals. The three system in the human society. Just like in India, Hindus, they burn the body. So the body is transformed into ashes---means earth. Ash means earth. Those who are burying the bodies of their forefathers, the body turns into dust, as the Christian //Bible// says, "dust thou art." This body is dust and again turns into dust. And those who are throwing for being eaten by the animals and birds, vultures, just like in India you have got the community, Parsee community. They do not burn, neither they bury. They throw and the vultures immediately comes and eat. Then the body turns into stool.

So either it will turn into ashes or into dust or into stool. This beautiful body, which you are soaping so nicely, it will turn into three stages, stool, ashes, or dust. So the finer elements means mind, intelligence and ego. That is altogether it is called consciousness. That will carry you, the spirit soul, small particle of spirit. That will be carried by these three finer elements: mind, intelligence and ego. And according to the, just like the flavor, if it is rose flavor aroma, you enjoy, "Oh it is very nice." And it is filthy flavor, passing through stool or any other filthy place and you say, "Oh, it is very bad smell." So this consciousness will carry you either in a stool smell or rose flavor according to your work, as you make your consciousness. So if you make your consciousness, train your consciousness into Kṛṣṇa, then it will carry you to Kṛṣṇa. This is not very difficult to understand. You cannot see the air but you can experience by smelling. "Oh the air is passing through like this." Similarly, these different kinds of body are developed according to the consciousness.

So if you have trained up your consciousness to the yogic principle, then you get a body, similar body. You get good chance, you get good parents, good family where you'll be allowed to practice this system and automatically you'll get chance again to revive your same consciousness in which you left your previous body. That is explained here. By virtue of divine consciousness. Therefore our present duty is how to make the consciousness divine. That should be our business. If you want divine life, if you want spiritual elevation back to Godhead, back to home, that means eternal life, blissful life full of knowledge, then we have to train ourselves in divine consciousness or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That you can very easily do by association. //Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ.// If you keep divine association, then your consciousness is made divine. And if you keep hellish association, demonic association, then your consciousness is trained up in that way.

So we have to train our consciousness divine. That is the duty of human form of life. If we make our consciousness divine, then we are preparing for next divine life. As there are different grades of life, so human form of life is a chance to make your next life completely divine. Completely divine means eternal, blissful and full of knowledge. So automatically by divine consciousness you try to contact the persons who are developing divine consciousness. So this is explained in this verse. Go on.

**Devotee:**
"When the yogi engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress being washed of all contaminations, then ultimately, after many, many births of practice, he attains the supreme goal."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So it is a question of practice. Just like a child born, he does not know how to smoke, how to drink, but by association he becomes a drunkard, a smoker, intoxication. By association. So it is a question of association only. //Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ.// If the association is good, our carrier is being spoiled because we are not keeping good association. So this is explained here, that: "But when the yogi engages himself with sincere endeavor in making further progress." Just like in business also, there are so many association, corporation. Because by becoming member of that corporation the particular type of business flourishes. They have got exchange. They can make exchange, bill of exchange, stock exchange. So association is so important. So if we become serious for developing divine consciousness, then this is the only association---we have established the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. Here simply the method how one can become divine conscious, that is taught. So this is a good chance. We invite everyone to join and the process is very simple. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and you'll feel. There is no difficult process. The children also can take part and actually they are taking part. You don't require any previous qualification. That you must have passed your master of degree examination or this or that. Whatever you are, you simply come and join this association and you become Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is the advantage of this society. It is clear. Please try to understand. Go on. Purport?

**Devotee:**
"A person born in a particular righteous, aristocratic or sacred family becomes conscious of his favorable condition for executing yoga practice. With determination, therefore, he begins his unfinished task, and thus he completely cleanses himself of all material contaminations. When he is finally free of all contaminations, he attains the supreme perfection, Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
It is, try to understand, that, the Supreme Lord, God is pure. And His kingdom is also pure. And anyone who wants to enter there, he must be pure. That is very natural. That if you want to enter into some particular society, you must qualify yourself. Qualification is to go back to home, back to Godhead, the qualification is that you should not be materially contaminated. And what is that material contamination? The material contamination is sense gratification. Unrestricted sense gratification. That is material contamination. So you have to make yourself free from material contamination. Then you become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God. That process of being freed or being washed of all material contamination, is yoga system. Yoga system does not mean that you sit down for fifteen minutes for so-called meditation and you continue all your material contamination. Just like if you want to be cured from a certain type of disease, you have to follow the regulation made by the physician. Similarly, in this chapter the process of yoga practice is recommended, how you have to do it. So that means if you execute these prescribed methods, then you become freed from material contamination. Then you are actually situated for linking up, for making connection with the Supreme. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Our method is directly to connect you. That is the special gift of Lord Caitanya. Immediately to contact him with Kṛṣṇa. Because ultimately you have to come to that point, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So here this method is that directly, immediately. And it is practical also. Those who have no qualification, they simply by coming in contact with the society they have become highly advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is practical. So in this age we have to give chance to the people, direct contact. No slow process method will help them because the life is very short, they are not very much fortunate and the association is very bad. Therefore, direct contact---//harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. Simply Kṛṣṇa is presented in the form of His transcendental name and you contact Him immediately by hearing. You have got natural instrument, hearing. You simply hear "Kṛṣṇa" and you become uncontaminated immediately. Go on.

**Devotee:**
"Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the perfect stage, being freed of all contaminations. This is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// After many, many births in execution of pious activities when one is completely freed from all contaminations and from all illusory dualities, one then becomes engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam.// The exact verse in the //Bhagavad-gītā// is //yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam. Pāpam// means sin. One who has completely ended sinful activities, //janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām:// persons who have simply executed pious activities. Such person becomes fixed up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness without any dualities. Because our mind is flickering, so dualities will always come. Whether I shall accept it or not. Whether I shall become Kṛṣṇa conscious or another conscious, these problems are always there. But if one is advanced by pious activities in the previous life, then he is fixed up steady, "I'll become Kṛṣṇa conscious." So this method, this chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa method, even in your previous life you did not act very piously or in this life, it doesn't matter. If you kindly take seriously this simple method, Hare Kṛṣṇa, chanting, you become immediately pure. But with determination that you'll not contact any more impious activities.

Just like in our society we make four restriction. Anyone who desires to be initiated in our society, we put four principles. No illicit sex life. We don't say that don't have sex life. No illicit sex life. You get yourself married and for children you can have sex life. Not for another purpose. So, no illicit sex life, no intoxication. Our students, they do not smoke even, they do not take tea even, coffee. So what to speak of other things, so they are pure. No gambling and no animal food. That's all. If you simply follow these four principles, then you become immediately uncontaminated. Immediately. Without any further endeavor. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so nice that as soon as you join you become immediately uncontaminated. But do not contaminate again. Therefore these restrictions. Because our contamination begins from these four kinds of bad habits. But if we check, then there is no question of contamination. As soon as I take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness I become free. Now if I become cautious not to accept these four principles, then I am free, I am continuing uncontaminated. This is the process. But if you think that because Kṛṣṇa consciousness makes me free, so let me indulge in all these four principles and I will get free after chanting. That is cheating. That will not be allowed. Once you are free, but don't do it again. But if you think "I shall do it and make myself free."

Just like in some religious process it is said that you commit all kinds of sins and go to the church and simply confess, you are free. So this doing and confessing, doing and confessing is going on. But here, no. If you are freed, that's all right. But don't do it again. That is the purpose of confession. Confession, if you confess that "I have done these sinful activities," so why should you do again? If you confess that it is sinful, pickpocketing is sinful, take for example. So by confessing you are freed, then why shall you do it again? It requires little intelligence. It does not mean that because by confessing I become freed, I shall go on continuing this and again confess and become freed. No. That's not good. If it is not good, you have confessed that it is not good, then you should not do it again. That is the purpose. Not that you do it and confess, do it and confess, do it and confess. This business is not good. So we should be careful, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, that these four principles, if you indulge in unrestricted, then you become contaminated. But if you take precaution in executing these four principles. We don't say that you don't have sex life. You have. But for this purpose, not for this purpose. Similarly you eat but you eat this way, not that way.

So defend, Kṛṣṇa also advised Arjuna to defend. So defend is also not prohibited provided it is for right cause. So in this way if we can come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately we become free from all contamination. And if we take precaution of these four principles, then our life is pure. And if we can continue this pure life till the time of death you are sure to be transferred to the kingdom of God. Go on. That is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā// you have already read: //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. By giving up this body, that person who is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he does not come back again to take part in this material world. This yogi who is coming to a good family, to a righteous family or rich aristocratic family, they are coming back. But if you are perfect Kṛṣṇa consciousness you are no more coming back. You are situated in the Goloka Vṛndāvana in the spiritual sky. So we should try not to come back again. Because if I come back again, suppose I have got very nice chance. I have got birth in a very good family, in rich family. But if I cannot utilize it properly, then again I degrade myself to other sort of life. So why should we take this risk. Better complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this life. It is very simple. It is not very difficult. Simply to keep yourself in thoughts of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. It is very simple thing. Then you are assured to your next birth in the spiritual sky in the kingdom of God or in the Goloka Vṛndāvana. Yes. [end]
