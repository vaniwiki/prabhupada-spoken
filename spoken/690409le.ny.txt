====== Śrīla Prabhupāda and Disciples Speak ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. So today you speak something, I shall hear. Yes. Any of you can speak something from //Śikṣāṣṭaka?// Yes? Stand up.

**Viṣṇujana:**
"Glory to Śrī Kṛṣṇa //saṅkīrtana,// which cleanses the heart of all the dust accumulated for years together. And thus the fire of conditional life, of repeated birth and death, is extinguished. Such //saṅkīrtana// movement gives the essence of all nectar of transcendental bliss and helps us to have a taste of that full nectarean for which always anxious we are." So this is the mercy you have given us, this //saṅkīrtana// movement, that every day, ten hours a day, we can chant the holy name of God right out on the street, and everyone who sees and hears is learning about Lord Caitanya, is learning about the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement and is practically engaged in devotion.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. Ṛṣi Kumāra, you can speak something? Yes.

**Ṛṣi Kumāra:**
In the Vedic literatures it is stated that there are 8,400,000 species of life that one can take in this material world. So we've come to this human form, taken this human body, and it's such a great opportunity for realizing the purpose of life. We're so fortunate that Prabhupāda has come to teach us this process of realizing our self in this human form. So take advantage of this causeless mercy which Kṛṣṇa has sent us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. Hm. There is a verse by Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, //vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam apāyayan mām anabhīpsum andhaṁ kṛpāmbudhir yas tam aham...// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. //Sanātanam... Kṛpāmbudhir yas sanātanaṁ prabhu tam aham āśrayaḥ.// Like that. Sanātana... Six Gosvāmīs, Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, Raghunātha Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, Jīva Gosvāmī. So Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, he was a very rich man's son and he was youngest. All the Gosvāmīns used to treat him as younger brother. So he's writing his realization, //vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam.// This //bhakti-yogam,// devotional service, is..., another name is //vairāgya-vidyā. Vairāgya-vidyā// means... //Vairāgya// means renunciation. We are now caught up by this material body, and we have to get out.

So this process of getting out is noncooperation. That is called //vairāgya-vidyā.// So Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī says that "I was unwilling to accept this //vairāgya-vidyā,// but He forced me to take it." And... //Apāyayan mām anabhīpsum andham:// "Because I was blind, I thought that this material world is everything. Therefore I was blind. And therefore I was unwilling also." People are unwilling to accept the Kṛṣṇa consciousness because they are blind. They do not see actual position of their life. That is the position [of] conditioned soul. They are busy simply for sense gratification. So //vairāgya-vidyā// means not sense gratification, but to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanam:// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]] to satisfy the senses of Kṛṣṇa. Material life means satisfying our own senses, and //vairāgya-vidyā,// or devotional service, means satisfying Kṛṣṇa's senses. That's all. What is the difference between material so-called love and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa love? The difference is, in the material world, both the parties, they are trying to satisfy their own senses. It doesn't matter. When a boy loves a girl or a girl loves a boy, the motive is his or her own sense satisfaction. But the //gopīs,// their view is... Not only //gopīs.// All the cowherds boys, Mother Yaśodā, Nanda Mahārāja, the Vṛndāvana party. So all of them---ready to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, when He was a boy, His father was arranging for Indra-//yajña.// Kṛṣṇa said, "My dear father, there is no need of arranging for Indra-//yajña.// Better you offer these materials to Govardhana Hill." The father answered, "My dear boy, if You want to offer some sacrifice to the Govardhana Hill, I shall arrange for another //yajña.// This is our custom. We are observing this traditionally. So let us perform this." Kṛṣṇa said, "No, there is no need." The old man immediately rejected, "All right. Kṛṣṇa, to satisfy Kṛṣṇa." The old tradition immediately gave up. And Indra saw, "Oh, this boy is so impudent. He has stopped my //yajña.// All right, I shall teach something."

So there was torrents of rain, heavy rain, for seven days in Vṛndāvana, and Kṛṣṇa took up that Govardhana Hill on the little finger of His left hand and kept it for seven days in this way. [referring to picture?] Where is that Govardhana Hill? Is that Govardhana Hill? No. Inside, yes. No, no. No, there is no need. Yes. So Kṛṣṇa is so powerful that even when He was seven years old He could raise the hill, Govardhana Hill, on the top of His little finger, left hand, like this. So we worship such kind of God. Yes. Who can... [chuckles] We don't want petty gods. You see. We want God like that. Yes. When He was on the lap of His mother and the Pūtanā came to kill Him by sucking her breast, so Kṛṣṇa sucked her breast and life both. This is Kṛṣṇa. God is not made, manufactured, that by meditation one becomes God. "First of all he was dog; now he has become God." It is not like that. God is God from the very beginning, always God. Whether He is a small baby or He's young man or... God never becomes old man.

So Kṛṣṇa showed all these demonstrations just to attract us. Just to let us know what is God. You are puzzled about God, you are speculating. Somebody is saying, "There is no God." Somebody is saying, "There is this, there is that." But here is actual God. So you see. And if you want God, then "Come on. I have come to take you back, back to home, back to Godhead." So this same thing is still going on. If you want to go to God, you can go. There is no hindrance. But if you want at all, then there is way, this //Bhagavad-gītā.// And the way is very simple. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Simply you become surrendered to Kṛṣṇa and always pray to Kṛṣṇa. Just like Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura prays, //hā hā prabhu nanda-suta, vṛṣabhānu-sutā-yuta:// "My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, the son of Mahārāja Nanda, now You are standing before me with Rādhārāṇī, the daughter of Vṛṣabhānu." //Hā hā prabhu nanda-suta, vṛṣabhānu-suta, karuṇā karoho ei-bāro:// "Many lives I have wasted in this material encagement. Life after life, I was frustrated and baffled. Now, this life I am dedicated unto You." //Hā hā prabhu nanda-suta, vṛṣabhānu, karuṇā karoho ei:// "Now You become merciful. You are already merciful, but due to my forgetfulness, rebellious condition of life, I did not surrender unto You. Now I have come to my senses." //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. "After many, many births, so I surrender unto You. Please give me Your protection." This much. That's all. There is no necessity. Of course, not in the beginning, but actually, one who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa fully, without any reservation, his life is perfect. That's all.

So keep this attitude of surrendering and then everything will come, perfection. And this remembrance also will be kept by chanting the //mantra,// Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes. Prabhati, Prabhati[?] should... Morning tune. Yes. [//kīrtana//] [end]
