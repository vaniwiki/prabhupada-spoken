====== Conversation Before Lecture ======

**Miss Rose:**
It's not in good order Swamiji.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Miss Rose:**
It's not in good order.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which order?

**Miss Rose:**
Well, my house where I live.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. I say that you purchase one house.

**Miss Rose:**
Participate in one house?

**Prabhupāda:**
Purchase.

**Devotee:**
Purchase. Buy.

**Miss Rose:**
Oh. Am I gonna dig gold?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, you have no money?

**Miss Rose:**
To buy a house? I wish I did. I'd take all of the disciples and put 'em all in one house.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You just make one down payment, and they will pay monthly.

**Miss Rose:**
Kṛṣṇa!

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Kṛṣṇa will help you.

**Miss Rose:**
Kṛṣṇa!

**Candanācārya:**
Sell your car!

**Miss Rose:**
I've got a bad back. I can't walk.

**Candanācārya:**
Your car helps your back?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, your car is so nice. If I would have remained here, I would ask you to donate this car to the society.

**Miss Rose:**
Can never tell what I do for [Prabhupāda chuckling] all my sisters and my brothers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Miss Rose:**
These are all my sisters and brothers, Swamiji. Right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. certainly. So don't worry. Kṛṣṇa will give you better place.

**Satsvarūpa:**
That was a disappointment because we almost, almost had it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No question of disappointment. In Los Angeles, we had so many disappointments. At last, we got very nice place. Now we are after bigger place.

**Candanācārya:**
Tell Swamiji about the church we want to get.

**Miss Rose:**
The church...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Then that article has worked adversely?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yeah. The real estate man said if it had only come out a week later, he said, "You'd be in."

**Prabhupāda:**
So publicity like this is not good for us, that people are thinking we are hippies.

**Miss Rose:**
Yes. That's true, Swamiji. Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
So then you should not give publicity. You must even in the beginning verify that we are not hippies. Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is not for hippies. In many places this is a notion, that we are hippies.

**Devotee:**
Montreal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
Montreal too, the same thing.

**Miss Rose:**
Yes, but a lot of hippies have gone back to... They've went to Florida, Swamiji. Thousands of hippies went back to Florida. They left Boston.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are, most of them, in Hawaii also.

**Miss Rose:**
Oh, there's some in Hawaii too?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Miss Rose:**
Oh.

**Candanācārya:**
Prabhupāda, I think he was worried because... [Break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...all right. We don't hate hippies. We have nothing... But these people misunderstand. That is... That is another thing. We welcome everyone. We have no such distinction.

**Miss Rose:**
Oh, yes, yes. Everyone can come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Never mind.

**Miss Rose:**
Kṛṣṇa's good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee:**
Kṛṣṇa wants a better place for us.

**Miss Rose:**
Kṛṣṇa wants a better place.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] And also it is a fact that many of our students have come from the hippies.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Almost all of them. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
So they are our best candidates. So you can advertise that "We are not hippies, but we are converting many hippies to the sane condition of life." That's a fact. They are searching after something better, but they have no leader.

**Miss Rose:**
Yes, that's true. That's it.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have no leader. Now, if they come to us seriously, they get the right thing. But that is also their defect. When we propose, "Come and take this Kṛṣṇa," they don't want. They want that marijuana.

**Candanācārya:**
Prabhupāda, my mother had the idea of going to rich parents who are very anxious about their children who've become hippies and saying that this movement...

**Prabhupāda:**
So you should write article that "We are not hippies, but we are converting hippies to the sane condition. So father, mothers, who are anxious for their children, let them send their children to us. We take care." In this way you make impression in the public mind.

**Candanācārya:**
And also they make donations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So our New Vrindaban scheme is there. Let them help and send their children. We make just opposite number of hippies. Yes.

**Miss Rose:**
Swamiji, but that has to advertised in papers...

**Prabhupāda:**
So why don't you do it? This is a service. You can do it.

**Miss Rose:**
Yes, right.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are acquainted with so many people. You are experienced.

**Miss Rose:**
But I mean so that people can read it. So they'll understand it's not hippies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You go to responsible men and see, that "This is a nice movement. Why don't you patronize it to save your country's from the hippies' falling down, confusion?" We are saving. Practically this society is giving the best service to your country. They should appreciate, but they should not misunderstand us. How we can be hippies? We completely... That is also said. How foolish man he is, that, er... In that article, Satsvarūpa, in that article, it is clearly stated that we are refusing all these things. How they conclude that we are hippies?

**Satsvarūpa:**
It wasn't a bad article.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh! What a nonsense he is!

**Candanācārya:**
He is worried that hippies come to the ceremonies to see us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Candanācārya:**
I think that's why he's worried about hippies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Candanācārya:**
Because he saw photographs that audience was hippies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So that we cannot cancel: "These hippies are not admitted." No. We admit everyone. We cannot say that "Such and such person cannot enter into our temple." We cannot say. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is welcome. And, if they do not come, how they'll converted?

**Miss Rose:**
I think that the confusion is...

**Prabhupāda:**
We cannot say, just like, in some hotels, that "Such and such persons are not admitted." No. We cannot. We admit everyone. Our mission is to elevate persons from down state of life to the highest state of life. So everyone is in down state. Lord Jesus Christ also said that "You do not hate the sinners, but hate sin." Is not that, Lord Jesus Christ said? So hippies may be sinners. We raise them to the pious life. But we say, "Don't do this. Don't do this sinful act. Don't take intoxication. Don't do this. Don't do this." We hate sin, not the sinners. Actually. If we hate sinners, then where is the possibility of preaching?

**Miss Rose:**
If the hippies would come, come, come...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Miss Rose:**
Then you can get them out of this hippie into Christian conscience. See.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is our mission.

**Miss Rose:**
Yes. I can understand that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. All right. Kṛṣṇa will see. So you just give service to Kṛṣṇa, impressing people that these Kṛṣṇa conscious people are not hippies.

**Miss Rose:**
Oh, yes! I told a lot of people. You know, Swamiji, the first time when I heard about 95 Glenville Avenue, the first time, a woman told me that, she says, "You know," she says, "gypsies, we have neighbors, gypsies on the street." "Gypsies! I haven't seen any gypsies." Well, I put my shoes. I went downstairs. I went to the door and I start reading. I says, "This is spiritual. This is beautiful. This is spiritual." I forgot right away. So she came to the door, Jadurani. She came to the door and she said, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," and she said, "Come in." I came in and she started talking to me and that's... I got started. So when I seen her, I said, "That's not gypsies. That's not gypsies." And I explained it to her. "Oh," she said, "I seen the curtains in the window," she said, "and I thought they were gypsies." "Oh, well," I explained it to her. "Oh," I says. I let her have it, there was no gypsies there. So she used to see me coming down to got to the temple. So nice, yeah? Do you like that place, Swamiji?

**Prabhupāda:**
Which place?

**Miss Rose:**
Where the disciples are now, on Glenville Avenue? Or do you think that you need another place?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, sometimes the, some children disturb. They broke...

**Miss Rose:**
No. Oh, I know they broke the windows. I know that. You know, Swamiji, it's very hard to find apartments, and, Swamiji, they're very expensive. $125, $135, $145 dollars a month, the apartments are. See. Yeah. [indistinct] And they're very, very hard to find. And sometimes I want to get out of there myself. Because, I mean, there is so many... It's really turning out to be kind of a bad, a lot of children there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let us see. As Kṛṣṇa desires. Begin //kīrtana.// Chant. [end]
