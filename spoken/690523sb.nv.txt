**[My dear Lord, and the spiritual energy of the Lord, kindly engage me in Your service. I am now embarrassed with this material service. Please engage me in Your service.]**

So sage Nārada is trying to enliven Vyāsadeva. Vyāsadeva was learned. Not ordinarily learned. He is the incarnation of God, Nārāyaṇa. He appeared for spreading Vedic knowledge. Therefore Nāradajī, it is stated here, //smayann iva. Smayann iva// means, //smayan// means smiling, that "Such a great personality also becomes morose." After giving so many contribution, literary contribution, still he was not happy. So it is wonderful... So therefore he was smiling. //Smayann iva. Devarṣiḥ prāha viprarṣiṁ vīṇā-pāṇiḥ smayann iva.// He said,

> jijñāsitam adhītaṁ ca
> brahma yat tat sanātanam
> tathāpi śocasy ātmānam
> akṛtārtha iva prabho
> [[books:sb:1:5:4|[SB 1.5.4]]]

//Jijñāsitam.// This is very important thing, //jijñāsitam.// This is the beginning of life actually. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// Inquisitiveness. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta// [SB 11.3.21]. One should search after a guru, //jijñāsu,// one who is inquisitive. That is actually life. Just like animals, they are not inquisitive. They are simply concerned with the four principles of bodily necessities. Eating... //Udaram, dākṣyaṁ kuṭumba-bharaṇam.// In this age, Kali-yuga, if one can eat sumptuously, he thinks that "All my interest is now fulfilled. I have eaten very nicely today." That's all. [chuckles] And //dākṣyaṁ kuṭumba-bharaṇam.// And if he can maintain a wife and three children, oh, he is Dakṣa Mahārāja. Dakṣa Mahārāja. This is the age of Kali. You see? If one can simply eat and if he's well-to-do, he can maintain...

And when I was in New York, one old lady, she used to come to my class. Not in Second Avenue. When I first started in 72nd Street. So she had a son. So I asked, "Why don't you get your son married?" "Oh, if he can maintain a wife, I have no objection." Just to maintain a wife is a great job in this age. //Dākṣyaṁ kuṭumba-bharaṇam.// And still we are very much proud that we are advancing. Even a bird maintains a wife, even a beast maintains wife. And human being hesitates to maintain a wife? You see? And they are advanced in civilization? Hm? It is a very horrible age.

Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that don't waste your time in any way. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. So people are not at all interested in spiritual life. No inquiry. No inquiry. But that is the life, that is human life. //Jijñāsitam. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta// [SB 11.3.21]. One must find out a person, guru, a spiritual master, and inquire from him the problems of life. Just like Sanātana Gosvāmī. You'll find in the teachings of Lord Caitanya, he inquired. He was a great minister, and he thought himself that "I am a most third-class man because I do not know what is the aim of my life." //Ke āmi kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya:// "Why I am put into this miserable condition of material existence? I don't want all these miserable conditions. Still, they are enforced upon me." So there should be inquiry. But the animal has no inquiry. Just like the goat is standing whole night. Just see. It has no power to inquire, "Oh, why you have put me into this condition?" That is animal life. "All right, suffering is there. All right, disease is there. That's all right. Death is there, all right. Old age is there, all right." This is animal life.

Therefore Nārada says, //jijñāsitam adhītaṁ ca.// "You are not a fool. You have inquired sufficiently, and you have studied." //Adhītaṁ ca.// So it is not that without studying, without inquiry one becomes elevated. No. //Jijñāsitam adhītaṁ ca brahma.// What about, inquiry? Brahman. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// Ordinary //jijñāsā,// "What is the news today?" this is not //jijñāsā. Jijñāsā// means //brahma-jijñāsā. Jijñāsitam adhītaṁ ca brahma yat tat sanātanam. Sanātanam// means eternal. We should inquire about our eternal life, eternal blissful life. That is our prerogative. So "You have done all these things." He had a spiritual master like Nārada, and he was himself Vyāsadeva. So everything was first class. But still, //tathāpi,// still, //śocasi,// "You are lamenting. You are morose. You are morose, you are unhappy just like you have //akṛtārtha,// you have done nothing." So we have to become //kṛtārtha. Kṛtārtha// means one who has finished his job, //kṛtārtha.// The Sanskrit words are very appropriate. People still have to learn so many things from this Vedic literature.

Then Vyāsadeva replies, //asty eva me sarvam idaṁ tvayoktam.// "My dear sir, my dear spiritual master, whatever you are saying, it is all right. I have studied sufficiently. I have inquired sufficiently. I know about Brahman, everything. I have written //Vedānta-sūtra;// still..." //Asty eva. Asty eva me sarvam idaṁ tvayoktam.// "Whatever you are saying, everything is there in me." //Tathāpi nātmā parituṣyate me.// "Still I don't find satisfaction." //Tan-mūlam avyaktam.// "And what is the cause? That is also I do not know." //Tan-mūlam avyaktam agādha-bodhaṁ pṛcchāmahe tvātma-bhavātma-bhūtam. Bhavātmā. Ātma-bhūtaṁ bhava.// "You are the son of Brahmā." Brahmā is called //ātma-bhūtam.// Brahmā is not born of ordinary father and mother. Brahmā is born of the Supreme Lord, Supreme //ātmā,// Nārāyaṇa, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. Therefore he is called Svayambhū. Brahmā's another name is Svayambhū. //Sa vai bhavān veda samasta-guhyam upāsito yat puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ.// Now here Nārada's qualification is that "Because you are a great devotee of the original Personality of Godhead, //puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ." Śāśvataṁ puruṣam ādyam.// Just like Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa, //śāśvataṁ puruṣam ādyam.// Just like we are singing now, //govindam ādi-puruṣam.// So //purāṇa-puruṣam. Purāṇa-puruṣam,// the oldest //puruṣa,// oldest being. The oldest being is Kṛṣṇa. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam// [Bs. 5.33]. These references are all the same, either you take //Vedānta-sūtra// or you, say, take //Brahma-sūtra// or you take //Brahma-saṁhitā// or //Bhāgavatam.// There is no contradiction, because the same truth is explained in different Vedic literature.

So [Sanskrit commentary:] //kiṁ ca yat sanātanaṁ nityaṁ paraṁ brahma ca tac ca tvayā jijñāsitaṁ vicaritam adhītam adhigataṁ prāptam cety arthaḥ. Ātma-bhavaḥ, avyaktam asphutam, he nārada. Tva tvaṁ pṛcchāmi. Ātma-bhavaḥ avyaktaṁ brahma tasya ātmano dehodbhutams tam.[?]// "So because you are directly from Brahmā, therefore I am asking you, what is this?" //Sa vai bhavān veda samasta-guhyam upāsito yat puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ. Puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ. Puruṣa,// the //puruṣa...// God is //puruṣa.// God is never female. This is another rascaldom. There are many rascals who think that God is female. "Kālī, Goddess Kālī is God." Goddess Kālī, how can be God? She is //śakti. Śakti.// Every Vedic scripture it is said that //parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ.// Everything is energy. So how God can be... That is the impersonalist. He can think of God, imagine, imagine. It is imagination. The Māyāvādī theory is that God..., there is no God. The impersonal, there is voidness. You can imagine any form. That's all. //Sādhakānāṁ hitārthāya brahmaṇo rūpaḥ kalpanaḥ.[?] Kalpanaḥ// means imagination.

So except the //sātvatas,// nobody knows what is God. //Sātvata// means Vaiṣṇava. Nobody knows what is God. They sometimes accept "This is God, this is God, this is God, this is God." No. God is the original Supreme Person, male, enjoyer. Male is called enjoyer, predominator. //Puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ. Parāvareśo manasaiva viśvaṁ sṛjaty avaty atti guṇair asaṅgaḥ.// And //para. Parāvaraḥ. Para// means transcendental, and //avara, avara// means this material, inferior. //Avara// means inferior. And //para// means superior. That is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā. Itas tu me... Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ buddhir mano eva ca, itas tu me...// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. //Aparā. Apareyam.// This material nature, consisting of earth, water, air, ether, mind, intelligence, ego: eight. This is //avara. Avara// means inferior. And there is another nature. //Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyaḥ// [[books:bg:8:20|[Bg. 8.20]]]. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// you'll find, there is another nature. That is //para. Para. Tasmāt. Tasmāt// means out of this //avara,// inferior nature, there is another, superior nature, //para.// The same thing is here also. //Parāvareśaḥ.// But Kṛṣṇa is //īśa,// the controller of both the energies, the spiritual energy and material energy. //Parāvareśaḥ.//

//Parāvareśo manasaiva viśvaṁ sṛjaty avati. Manasaiva,// "simply by thinking." Just like in the Bible it is said, "Let there be creation." Immediately there is creation. //Manasaiva.// We can compare just a very rich man, many assistants, many managers. Just like, take, in your country, Rockefeller or somebody like that. He thinks something to do, business. Simply he orders his secretary, "This should be done," it is done. Without his personal effort, immediately done. Because why? Because he has got superior energy or power. In the material world... Material world means this monetary strength he has got. So simply by his desire, the secretary arranges everything and everything is nicely done. But he is sitting in his room. If it is possible for a person who is little materially rich, just imagine how much it is possible by God, the Supreme. Simply by willing, everything will be done. He hasn't got to do anything. //Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate. Veda// also.

So He has nothing to do. So who is that God? That Kṛṣṇa. He has nothing to do. He is simply enjoying, playing His flute, and Rādhārāṇī is serving. Oh, He is not taking a sword and fighting. Why He should fight? He hasn't got to fight. Then one can say, "Then why He was in the battlefield?" Yes, battlefield He was. He was not to fight there. He was to see the fun, how the fight is going on. He was to give instruction. He was to give, deliver this //Bhagavad-gītā.// He was not fighting. That is God. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. He's instructing Arjuna, His friend, that "You fight." By His simple will everything would have been done, fighting would have been finished. He says that //nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin.// "I have already planned it. If you don't fight, don't think that these persons who have assembled here, they will go back home. They are already finished. That plan is already made. Simply you take the credit, that you are Kṛṣṇa's friend, you have won the battle. That's all. I am giving you this chance of taking the credit." This is God. God hasn't got [chuckling] to labor and meditate and push nose, and he becomes God. No. God is God. Simply by His will, God. Everything is God. So this bluffing, that by meditation one can become, by silent, becoming silent, one become God, this condition... God is not under any condition. Why God should be under condition?

So therefore it is said, //manasaiva viśvaṁ sṛjati.// That is God. Simply by willing, "Let there be creation." Simply that word is sufficient. Immediately perfect. //Pūrṇam idam. Pūrṇam idam// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśopaniṣad, Invocation]]]. Everything full. Just like see, every planet is complete. Complete. Whatever is needed, there is complete arrangement. Take, for example, in our planet. We require water. The sufficient water is stocked, and the water is evaporated by the sun, and it is stocked again on the hill, reservoir, and from there supply, whole year is being supplied by river, and again it is going to the reservoir. How complete it is. Everything you will find complete. //Pūrṇam idam,//

> pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idaṁ
> pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate
> pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya
> pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate
> [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]

So simply //manasaiva viśvaṁ sṛjaty avaty atti.// This creation, //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]], the whole creation by the will of the //purāṇaḥ puruṣaḥ,// the Supreme Lord, is coming into existence, manifested, again becoming nonmanifest. //Guṇair asaṅgaḥ.// How it is becoming manifested and nonmanifested? By the interaction of the three material modes of nature. But He is apart from that. //Guṇair asaṅgaḥ.//

> tvaṁ paryaṭann arka iva tri-lokīm

"So you are a devotee of such Personality of Godhead. You are recognized devotee. Therefore I request you to find out what is the defect in me that after inquiring, after doing so many books and literatures, I am not happy. So you..." The same thing, as Arjuna surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, that "The disturbance which I am feeling in this battlefield, that can be solved by You only. Therefore I am surrendering unto You as my spiritual master. No more friendly talks. And You just teach me." So this is the, I mean to say, eternal process. Even Vyāsadeva is surrendering to Nārada. Such a great scholar. Even Arjuna is surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. So why? Either you have to surrender to Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative. Then there is solution. Otherwise there is no solution.

> tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta
> jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam
> śābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ
> brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam
> [SB 11.3.21]

One who has taken shelter of the Supreme Lord, //upaśama,// finishing all, I mean to say, material desires... //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. "Vāsudeva is everything." //Sa mahātmā.// So we have to search out a //mahātmā,// a person who is simply a surrendered soul to Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, and we have to surrender unto him. This is called disciplic succession. Then our problems will be solved. Otherwise, even a personality like Vyāsadeva, he has problems. Even a personality like Arjuna, he has problems. So //antaś-caro vāyur ivātma-sākṣī parāvare brahmaṇi dharmato vrataiḥ. Vrataiḥ. Dṛḍha-vrata. Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.// Any person who has simply acted piety, //janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇāṁ te,// such person, //bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ.//

So to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, or to become a devotee, is not ordinary thing. One has to finish the business of all sinful reaction. //Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpam.// So long there will be //pāpam,// he'll be hesitating to surrender unto Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given us this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// that all //pāpas// will be finished. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. If one chants Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra offenselessly, just according to regulation, then he is //anta-gataṁ pāpam. Anta-gatam. Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.// [pause]

So Kṛṣṇa says, //yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.// One who has finished all sinful reaction. This can be done. But we have our ten kinds of offenses. //Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.// This Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// will finish all my sinful reaction, that is a fact. As soon as I chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, immediately my sinful reaction is finished. But that does not mean that "Because I chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, then let me, from morning to evening, let me do all kinds of sinful reaction and sinful activities, and I shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, everything will be finished." Just like in Christian religion there is a faith that confession, weekly confession. That is nice. When you confess your sinful activities before the higher authorities, before the representative of God, Lord Jesus Christ, or God, or Kṛṣṇa, your sinful activities are finished. That's all right. But that does not mean that you shall go again, and again commit sinful activities, and again come at the end of the week and finish your business. No. This is not meant. One should be conscious.

Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He accepted Jagāi-Mādhāi... They were very sinful. But He simply asked the condition that "From this day no more sinful activities. You accept this, then I accept you." They promised, "Yes. Whatever we have done, no more." That should be the... Confess, God can excuse, and that is not difficult job. God can excuse any amount of sinful activity, but after confessing, after being free, if I again commit sinful activities, oh, that is the greatest sin. That is the greatest sin. One should be ashamed of, that "I... God has excused me. Again I shall? So I am so shameless." But this business is going on. No. That should not be. //Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.//

So we should not think that because we are chanting we can act all kinds of sinful activities. No. The chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa will give you protection, but you should not take advantage of. But if by accident or by unintentionally if you commit some, by habit, that is also excused. That is also stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Api cet su-durācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. That is accidental. Not that willful sinful activities should be done and it should be neutralized by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// No. Then you are spoiling your time. That should not be done. So //yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpam.// So without being freed from sinful activities nobody can take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The method is easy. You can get out of sinful activities. But don't commit again. If you think that "I shall ignite fire and pour water again," then what is the use of? Simply waste of time. So that should not be done.

So, //parāvare brahmaṇi dharmato vrataiḥ.// So one should execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //dharmataḥ,// in right path, and //vrataiḥ. Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ.// Just like today, //ekādaśī-vrata. Vrataiḥ.// This //ekādaśī-vrata// is required. Just see. Here it is that "You have performed all the //vratas.//" The purpose of //ekādaśī-vrata// is that today we should not eat much usual food, grains. The actual prescription is fasting. //Nirjala-ekādaśī. Nirjala// means there are many devotees who does not take even water. Water, drinking water, according to //śāstra,// it is taking food... It is drinking of food or no food. We can take both ways. So sometimes drinking of water is excused as //upavāsa// also. But there are many devotees who even..., drink even a drop of water. Whole day and night they fast and observe //ekādaśī-vrata.// And the night is called //harivāsara. Harivāsara// means the whole night they would chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma... This is called //vrata. Dṛḍha-vrata. Dṛḍha-vrata.//

//Dṛḍha// means very firm, steady. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He has given us so many concession. But we should be... Because there are some concession, better we should not take advantage of the concession, but we should be very steady and strong in our conviction and perform devotional service strictly. That is nice. //Vrataiḥ. Dharmato vrataiḥ. Parāvare brahmaṇi dharmato vrataiḥ snātasya. Snātasya// means taking bath. Just like if you... Of course, in your country there is no such thing. But in India they take bath in the Ganges. Completely dip. Just like you sometimes take bath in the ocean. So //snātasya. Snātasya. Snātasya// means completely taking bath in //dharmato vrataiḥ.// Fresh, refreshed.

So, //me nyūnam alaṁ vicakṣva:// "So you can find out what is the defect in me. Why I am morose?" Then Nārada is replying now.

> bhavatānudita-prāyaṁ
> yaśo bhagavato 'malam
> yenaivāsau na tuṣyeta
> manye tad darśanaṁ khilam
> [[books:sb:1:5:8|[SB 1.5.8]]]

He immediately replies that //bhavatā anudita-prāyaṁ yaśo bhagavataḥ amalam.// "You have compiled, or you have," I mean to say, "given so many literatures, but in each and every literature... Just like there are //Purāṇas,// eighteen //Purāṇas,// and //Mahābhārata,// and //Vedas,// and //Brahma-sūtra.// You have given so many literatures. But," //bhavatānudita-prāyaṁ yaśo bhagavato 'malam,// "there is no incessant glorification of the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

Just like //Mahābhārata.// That's a great epic. But there are politics. So many politics, sociology, fight, this, that, but in the middle there is a little glories of God, //Bhagavad-gītā.// So the book is not full of the glories of the... Kṛṣṇa is there, but that is a partial representation. Now Nārada Muni says that "Not as sidelight. Completely you have to write one book simply glorifying the Supreme Lord. Then you'll be satisfied." Not sidelight. Completely. //Bhavatānudita-prāyam// [[books:sb:1:5:8|[SB 1.5.8]]]. Here it is said, //parāvareśa... Anudita-prāyam, anukta-prāyam.// A sidelight. People take... Just like, "All right, yes, we accept God. But we cannot devote our whole time for God. We shall go weekly once or fortnightly once, or one hour in a day, partial. Our business is another. We want to enjoy sense gratification, and we shall go to church or temple just to ask God to supply our ingredients of sense gratification: 'Oh God, give me this. Give me this. I am poor man. I am this. I am this. I am suffering. I have got some disease.' " But still //Bhagavad-gītā// says that they are //sukṛtina.// Because they go to temple or church asking God something, because they are accepting that "There is God who can satisfy our needs," therefore they are //sukṛtina.// But those who are //duṣkṛtina,// miscreants, they don't believe in God. Then where is the chance of asking God, "Please give me this, give me that"? Because they don't believe in God. Therefore they are //duṣkṛtina,// atheist. In comparison to such person, those who go to the temple or church, ask something from God, they are better. Because they are accepting. They have at least come to God. Now, gradually, they will be purified, and at a time they will say, //svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]], "No. No more. I have no demand." What demand? If one gets Kṛṣṇa, then what is the question of demand? He gets everything. Everything. There is no question of demand. So that stage is perfect. So, [reads commentary] //Anudita-prāyam anukta-prāyaṁ vimalaṁ bhagavad-yaśo vinā yenaiva dharmādi jñānenāsau bhagavān na tuṣyati[?]// Śrīdhara Svāmī gives note that if you become a rigid religious person, that does not mean [chuckling] God will be satisfied with you. That is preliminary stage. //Dharmārtha-kāma-mokṣa// [[books:sb:4:8:41|[SB 4.8.41]]]. If one religious man... But that is not the qualification. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was talking with Rāmānanda Rāya, He, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, inquired what is the aim of life and what is the procedure of achieving that aim. He prescribed this //varṇāśrama-dharma.// Because that is the beginning of actual human life, accepting four //varṇas// and four //āśramas.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately rejected, //eho bāhya āge kaha āra.// These are not very important things. Just see. The whole Vedic civilization is resting on the //varṇāśrama-dharma.//

> varṇāśramācāravatā
> puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān
> viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā
> nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]

That is the statement, that one who is rigidly performing the rules and regulation of these four //varṇas// and //āśramas... Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate.// Simply by following the rules and regulation, //varṇāśrama// system, one can worship Viṣṇu. //Viṣṇur ārādhya... Nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam.// There is no alternative to satisfy Him. That... This is an authorized statement. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //eho bāhya āge kaha āra,// "This is external. This is not very important thing. If you know something more, that you can say." //Eho bāhya āge kaha āra. Āge kaha āra.//

So to become a religious person, to become economically very well-to-do, or to become a salvationist, desiring to merge into the existence, to become one with God, these things are not, I mean to say, very satisfactory to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Bhaktas tu toṣa-bhagavān gaja-yuta pāya.[?]// If you want to satisfy the Supreme Lord, then you have to accept this path of devotional service. There is no second path. There is no second path. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also it is said that //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. If one wants to know the Absolute Truth, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in truth, not fictitiously, then //bhaktyā. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// means through devotional service. So here also it is said that //bhavatānudita-prāyaṁ yaśo bhagavato 'malam// [[books:sb:1:5:8|[SB 1.5.8]]], "You have not stated very nicely, in devotion, in love, about the transcendental glories of the Lord." //Yenaivāsau na tuṣyeta manye tad...// And if Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is not satisfied... //Yena eva asau na tuṣyeta. Asau bhagavān na tuṣyeta,// is not pleased, //manye tad darśanaṁ khilam.// That is insignificant. That means he hinted that "You are very much proud that you have written //Vedānta-sūtra.// You don't think by writing your //Vedānta-sūtra// God is pleased. Don't think so. It is clearly said //manye tad-darśanam.// "You have done wonderful work in writing //Vedānta-sūtra,// but I think," //tad darśanaṁ khilam,// "it is insignificant. It is no..." Because by philosophical speculation, by argument, this or that, it is all...

God is not satisfied because you are very erudite scholar. God is satisfied by the love of //gopīs.// They are not philosophers, they are not even //brāhmaṇas,// they are not even man. Ordinary village girls, but their devotion for Kṛṣṇa, oh, there is no comparison. There is no comparison. Therefore Lord Caitanya says, //ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-varge...// And Caitanya Mahāprabhu's life was to love Kṛṣṇa: //gopī-bhāva-rasāmṛtābdhi-laharī-kallola-magnau.// This is the Gosvāmīs. Simply they were trying to come to that stage on which //gopīs// loved Kṛṣṇa. //Gopī-bhāva-rasāmṛtābdhi-laharī-kallola-magnau muhuḥ.//

So that is the highest stage, how to love Kṛṣṇa without any motive, without any material profit, without any personal consideration. That, if we can reach that, then //yayātmā suprasīdati,// then we'll be satisfied. Otherwise there is no satisfaction. It is simply useless, waste of time. That's all.

Thank you very much. [end]
