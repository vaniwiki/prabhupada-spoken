====== Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said that this //Kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana//---Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare---//paraṁ vijayate:// "All glories." //Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam. Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam.// Because the //śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana// will increase the ocean of transcendental bliss. Now, here in this meeting we are present. I am an old man of seventy-four years old, and here is a child, one year old. So beginning from this child, //abala-vṛddha-vanita// [?], the Sanskrit word. Beginning from the child, woman, up to the old man, everyone can take part in this //saṅkīrtana// movement. Actually we can see practically that everyone can take part in it. This is such a nice yoga system. There is no need of any material qualification. But we don't neglect material qualification. We can dovetail material qualification to render service to Kṛṣṇa, and that will make our all material possessions, assets, successful. [child making noises, like //japa//] He is trying to...

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. He's reaching[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] He is seeing mother's. You see? Therefore such child, they are all fortunate child. You see? He is learning automatically how to chant, how to keep the beads. So //śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sañjāyate// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. It is very nice that you have got tendency for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and this is the duty of father and mother, to raise children in that Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that this child can be saved from further bondage of birth and death. //Bhāgavata// says that "One should not become father, one should not become mother, unless they are able to save the child from the impending mouth of death. And //hariṁ vinā na mṛtiṁ taranti:// "Without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, nobody can be saved from the cycle of birth and death." That is not possible. There are many Vedic versions. //Yāvan na prītir mayi vāsudeve na mucyate deha-yogena tāvat. Deha-yoga// means contacting this material body. We are not this material body, but we have contacted. Just like we contact some infectious disease, similarly, we have somehow or other contacted. //Deha-yogena.// And that is the cause of all our misery.

So //Bhāgavata// says, //yāvan na prītir mayi vāsudeve.// So long one does not develop this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no chance of getting out of this contact of material body. We can get very nice body or very bad body. That doesn't matter. We can get a dog's body, or we can get a demigod's body. We can live for five minutes. There are many insects and germs which live for five minutes, and there are living entities in Brahmaloka who live for five millions of years. All varieties of life there are within this universe. By Kṛṣṇa's creation, you will find, //aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān:// the bigger than the biggest and the smaller than the smallest. You will find. Just see in this New Vrindaban. There are big trees, also small, very insignificant, so small tree that you are trampling over it. So in the living condition there are so many varieties, 8,400,000's of species. But the problem is not to promote ourself from this small body to big body, from the ant's body to elephant's body. That is not our problem. Not to accept this material body---to have our spiritual body, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1]. Just like Kṛṣṇa has //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha,// Nārāyaṇa has got //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha.// So that is our problem.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness will give us that opportunity, and those who are //gṛhasthas,// family men, their duty is to raise their children to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness so that actually the child will have full advantage of having a nice parent, nice father and mother. So this New Vrindaban we have selected to grow a community of such nice father and mother. There is //sannyāsī// also, //brahmacārī, gṛhastha.// We have no such distinction. //Yei kṛṣṇa bhaje sei guru haya.// Anyone who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and full in the understanding of science of Kṛṣṇa, he can become a spiritual master, a teacher. So in this Vṛndāvana, New Vrindaban, you should live in such a way, ideal way, that people will learn that what is actually human life, what is human civilization, how, what is, it is meant for. That we have to teach to the world. So those who are conducting this institution, my request is that you develop this place in such a nice way. And you can practically see. If we train... Just this child is dancing. This child is trying to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa with beads. Simply they are to be instructed. They must have the association. Then there will be a new growth of population, not like cats and dogs, but actually demigods, //devatā.// Demigods means devotees of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. And //asura// means nondevotee. So there is enough population of //asura// in this world. And the people are not happy because //āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.// This demonic civilization is killing the human race. So it is the responsibility of the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness to save so many ignorant, innocent people. They have got this human form of life to end all miserable condition of material existence. They are being misguided simply just like animals. It is not a good civilization. So this place is out of contact. It is Kṛṣṇa's desire that here no man of ordinary interest will come here. It is in a very nice location. It is beyond the reach of the ordinary class of men. [laughter] Just like Howard's father said that "I'll never come here." [laughter]

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Hṛṣīkeśa's lawyer, he just walked up here two miles looking for his dog.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, his dog lost?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Yes. And he is all upset.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So it is Kṛṣṇa's grace. [laughter] He had some affection for the dog. Now he can turn his affection for Kṛṣṇa. The dog is lost. So... No, dog will not be lost. He will greet. The dog, they are very... They will soon smell and find out the way. Dog will never be lost.

So our Mr. D.D. [referring to Dvārakādhiṣa] is in //samādhi.// Let him take rest. You can take rest. Go. [laughs] Yes. You are feeling //samādhi,// Mr. Ekendra? No, you can go and take rest. Yes. You are very good. So these children, they are coming. I especially request Swami Kīrtanānanda to take care of them. And here is a nice, motherly girl, Satyabhāmā, and her husband. They are all... So take care of these children. If you can make one child Kṛṣṇa conscious, it is a great service. Kṛṣṇa will be very pleased. So, so many children will come. This place is nice. And Kṛṣṇa will give us all opportunity. So I will also come again, and I like this place. So... Because I have come to preaching work, so let me finish whatever little work is still remaining. I want to go once to London and Germany. Then I will entrust the whole thing to you. So let us cooperate in this movement very nicely, and here in this spot, New Vrindaban, the woman's business will be to take care of the children, cooking cleansing, and churning butter. [laughter] And those who have the knowledge of typing can help in typing also. No other hard work. That's all. This is for woman. And for men, hard work, field work, taking care of the cows, of the animals, to go to collect wood, to construct building. In this way cooperate. The girls who are here, they should prepare nice //prasādam// so that the boys, in time they can get their //prasādam,// timely. This is the duty. And they must be given timely breakfast, lunch //prasādam.// They will work hard. And the churning business is for the girls. That will keep your health very nice. Ma Yaśodā, the mother of Kṛṣṇa, just see how exalted she was. Materially, she was rich also. She had many maidservants. Still, she took pleasure in churning. You have seen the picture. Recently in Los Angeles they had the festival, //dadhi-maṇḍa...// What is called? Butter, butter ceremony. So people took part in churning, and there were twelve pounds of butter churned in the meeting. Yes. And they collected good amount by churning.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very nice. We churn butter and have festival and live nicely and dance, Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is very nice life. So just cooperate and try to improve. It will improve if you be sincere. Kṛṣṇa will send all help. And some day it will be actually replica of that Vṛndāvana. And our Kīrtanānanda Swami, he was in Vṛndāvana. He has got the ideas. Here is Keśighāṭa also. And try. Cooperatively you can do. Kṛṣṇa will help. So... And Jack and you... You have decided to remain here? Very nice. You have got very nice child. And now Mr. Ekendra is feeling //samādhi.// He can also take... [laughter] Let him take rest. You take rest. Ekendra? You take rest. Go. He is...

**Devotee:**
He says he wants to stay.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. You are feeling //samādhi.// Take rest. Yes. That will be nice. Then I shall call you again. No? All right. Let him stay. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Let us begin. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Do it like that, as I have done. Little, little. Yes. [devotees chanting //japa;// initiation ceremony beginning?]

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Three times. Now like this.

**Brahmānanda:**
Drink. Drink.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
And now once and throw.

**Prabhupāda:**
Throw it. Yes. That's all. You take. [end]
