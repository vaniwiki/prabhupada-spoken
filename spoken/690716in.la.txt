====== Lecture at Initiation Fire Sacrifice ======

**Prabhupāda:**
(devotees chanting responsively)

> ...pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato api vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bahya abhyantaraṁ śuciḥ
> śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu

The purport of this //mantra, namaḥ, namaḥ// means "I surrender," or "I become submissive," //namaḥ.// So one has to become submissive. //Apavitraḥ pavitro vā. Apavitraḥ// means contaminated. This material world is contamination, infection of the spirit soul. We are suffering... Just like in ordinary diseased condition we suffer on account of infection, similarly the..., one who is intelligent, he should understand that this conditional life is suffering. One should not be foolishly very optimistic, that "I am very well situated. I am enjoying life." This is ignorance. Nobody is enjoying life in this material world; everyone is suffering. //Saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka:// this world is just like blazing forest fire; so everyone is suffering, contaminated. This is the sign, symptoms of contamination, that suffering, threefold miseries-//ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika, ādhidaivika.// But as the animals, they suffer, but they do not understand, this is animal life. The animal is being taken to the slaughterhouse, but still he's happy. This is animal life. So when one cannot understand his sufferings of this material contamination, his life is animal life. He knows that he's suffering, but he's trying to cover the suffering by some nonsense means: by forgetfulness, by drinking, by intoxication, by this, by that. He's aware of his suffering, but he wants to cover his suffering in a nonsense way. Just like the rabbit. The rabbit, when he's in face to face of some ferocious animal, the rabbit closes the eyes. He thinks he is safe. Similarly, simply by trying to cover our sufferings by artificial means, that is not solution. That is ignorance. The suffering can be solved by enlightenment of spiritual life, spiritual bliss. That is the way. //Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam. Ānanda// means bliss, transcendental bliss. And there is ocean of transcendental bliss. If you want to dip into this ocean, there is chance for you. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// (//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12). //Vedānta-sūtra// says that we spirit soul, we are by nature full of bliss. That is our nature, //ānandamaya.// But we have been contaminated by this material affection. So one has to come out of it. That is the process of self-realization, liberation, whatever you call. The process is to come out of this contamination.

So this //mantra// suggests that either you are contaminated or not contaminated... It is not that... The Māyāvādī philosophers, they say that so long we are contaminated in the //māyā,// we can adopt any means of self-realization, and after self-realization, when we become liberated, we become one with the Supreme and there is no more any work. This is partially true. Partially true means when actually you realize yourself, then you have no material activities. That is the sign of self-realization. This is also stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

Self-realization, liberation, the sign is that he becomes joyful, //prasannātmā,// immediately. If you have actually realized yourself, simply by bluffing that "I am God, I am this, I am..." No. There are signs. If you are God, then you must be as joyful as God, as Kṛṣṇa. If you are suffering still and you are claiming that you are God, that is nonsense. You needn't become God. You, simply if you become in the light of God, you become joyful. Just like from the darkness of night, if you simply come to the sunshine, immediately your position is changed. It does not require that you have to become the sun. Simply by coming to the sunlight your purpose is fulfilled. So the sunlight and the sun is not different; they are one unit. But sunlight is not sun. That is knowledge. If we, if simply by coming you can come into the sunlight, if I think that I have become identical with the sun, that is nonsense. Sun, you cannot become identical with the sun. It is so powerful, the temperature is so high and great, that you cannot approach even sun. The scientists say even from so many millions of miles away, if a planet or somebody goes near the sun, immediately he will be burned into ashes. So this is false claim that //brahma-bhūtaḥ// means one becomes God. No. That means that you come to the light of God. That is also nice, to come to the light of God.

So //brahma-bhūtaḥ...// Anyway, if you realize yourself that you are not... That //brahma-bhūtaḥ// means simply to understand that I am not the material body. To be convinced firmly with all reasons and argument, firmly conviction, this is called faith. Faith is not flickering. One must be firmly convinced. So then you immediately become joyful. Just like if you are implicated with some undesirable affairs and if you, some way or other, your lawyer advises, "Oh, you are free from this implication. The law does not bind you," just like you feel pleasure, "Oh, I'm not in this implication?" "Yes," similarly, as soon as one is convinced that "I am not this material body," then immediately he becomes joyful. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. And what is that joyfulness? There is no lamentation and there is no hankering. If you have hankering, then you are not joyful. If you have lamentation, there is no hankering. If you have hankering, then you are not joyful. If you have lamentation, then you are not joyful. These are the signs. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// And if you are actually self-realized soul, in the light of God, then your treatment will be equal to all living entities. Not that "He is animal, he is man, he is black, he is white, he's this, he's Indian, he's American, he's Chinese." No. //Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// Everyone is spirit soul, son of God, part and parcel of God. This realization. //Prasannātmā.// He has no enemy. He becomes enemyless immediately, because he sees everyone part and parcel of God, everything energy of God, everything belongs to God, everything enjoyable by God, by Kṛṣṇa. In this way he sees in everything Kṛṣṇa, and nothing else. //Prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu...// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. That is the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām. Parām.// That is transcendental situation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to take one from the material concept of life, material consciousness, to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then he will be joyful. He will be no more hankering for anything material, neither he'll be sorry for any so-called material loss. And he'll be equal to everyone, universal brotherhood. So they do not know... They simply talk of these high sounds. But here is the process. If you adopt the process, then you come to the platform. It is open for everyone. So this //mantra// suggests that either you are in the material consciousness or not, //apavitraḥ pavitraḥ vā,// or in spiritual consciousness. It is not that when you are delivered from the material consciousness and come to the spiritual platform your service stops to Kṛṣṇa. That is not. Our service is eternal. We are serving here Kṛṣṇa, and after leaving this body, when you go directly to Kṛṣṇa, faced with..., the service is there. The service is the main means and the end. Not that this is simply means, and the end is something else. No. It is so nice, it is means and end, both. We are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa here, and when we go to Kṛṣṇa we shall chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, like that.

**Devotee:**
//Jaya.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
You see the pictures? They are also chanting.

> ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis
> tābhir ya eva nijarūpatayā kalābhiḥ
> goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.37]

This picture is the symbolic... //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.// There is a //rasa,// mellow---every //ānanda.// Just like if you take a nice fruit, mango, the taste is pleasing. That is called //rasa,// that taste. Anyway, anything enjoy, there is a //rasa. Rasa.// You love somebody, you kiss somebody, embrace somebody, there is a //rasa.// So this picture is //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.// Here we have got that taste of //rasa// in a perverted manner. But //cinmaya-rasa// means it continues. This Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa with the gopīs, they are enjoying, dancing, chanting. That is eternally; that is never stopped. It is not that they become old and there is no more enjoyment or they are separated or somebody, Kṛṣṇa goes somewhere and the Rādhārāṇī goes to somewhere. No. Everything is eternal. They are enjoying. That is the difference between this //rasa// and that //rasa.// This //rasa// is temporary. Your youthful enjoyment will not exist; it will be finished. Your American life will be finished. Your this life, that life, everything will be finished---and finished forever. Not that you are going to have it again. Therefore this is flashing. It is coming and going. But that life is eternal. That is //ānanda-cinmaya. Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. This //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa// is called //hladini-śakti,// Kṛṣṇa's pleasure potency. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate, na tasya karyaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. These are Vedic versions, that "The Supreme has nothing to do." Just like here if we enjoy in the hotel some dancing, and next morning I'll have to go into the garbage for bringing money for that dancing. I'll work, go underground to dig out garbage. It is not like that, that Kṛṣṇa has to go next morning to garbage. (laughter) You see? It is not that I'll have to acquire money by flattering somebody or working some in hell. No. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitā...// That is the expansion of His pleasure potency. Kṛṣṇa is Paraṁ Brahman. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. When Arjuna understood Kṛṣṇa, he says, confirms, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, You are Paraṁ Brahman, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead." This is understanding of //Gītā.// And after reading I understand that I am God. What is this nonsense? Where do you get this idea? Where it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā?// Simply bluffing, all these rascals, scholars, and so-called commentators. They're all rascals. They do not know what is //Bhagavad-gītā.// Here is //Bhagavad-gītā,// understanding Kṛṣṇa, accepting, Arjuna, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān śāśvataṁ puruṣam// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. The Supreme is //puruṣam.// He is not female. Just like some rascal thinks that He's Kālī, He's Durgā. No! Kālī, Durgā are His potencies. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva.// The Supreme has many kinds of potencies. Goddess Kālī is also one of the potencies, Durgā is also one of the potencies. Not that Durgā is the Absolute Truth. This is nonsense. That is stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā, sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir eka chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni bibharti durgā// [Bs. 5.44]. Durgā. What is that Durgā? Durgā is the material nature, very powerful. //Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktiḥ.// She has got the power of creating, maintaining and dissolving. She is so powerful. You have seen Durgā's picture. She has got ten hands. That's a long story, of course, Durgā, Caṇḍī. These are all described in the Vedic literatures. But she is not the absolute personality. //Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir eka chāyeva.// She is working simply just like shadow. As the shadow moves when the original substance moves, similarly, she is only working under the direction of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. She is the external potency. Similarly, Rādhārāṇī is a pleasure potency, and these gopīs are expansion of Rādhārāṇī, pleasure potency. So they are not ordinary girls, neither Kṛṣṇa is enjoying like us, that in the hotel at dance and in the morning the garbage. No. It is not like that. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis// [Bs. 5.37].

So when you enter into the Kṛṣṇa science you get so much volumes of transcendental knowledge, and we are trying to present before you this knowledge in so many ways, by cleansing your heart from this material contamination. And this initiation is the beginning of cleaning the contamination. Therefore this //mantra// suggests, //apavitraḥ pavitraḥ vā:// either you be contaminated or not contaminated. When one is not contaminated, he's relishing this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// by associating with Kṛṣṇa. Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī, he's also chanting. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is also chanting, but His chanting and my chanting, there is little difference. That chanting is on the transcendental platform, actually relishing with Kṛṣṇa. My chanting... In the beginning there are three stages: offensive stages, liberated stage, and relishing stage. So you will be initiated for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, there will be so many offenses. So we have to offend..., we have to defend ourself from the offenses. There are ten kinds of offenses. You'll get the list. So we shall try to avoid. Then our chanting will be purified. And when the chanting is purified, then immediately you are liberated. And after liberation? //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā:// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]] your life of devotional service actually begins. Then you relish reciprocation of love with Kṛṣṇa.

So everything can be attained simply by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Everything. The means is the end and the means is the whole. It is not that we accept something and give it up and again come to another stage. No. If you have got conviction, if you have got faith, if you are strenuous, immediately you are in the platform. //Apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā.// So any stage of life, //yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣam,// anyone who remembers Puṇḍarīkākṣam, Kṛṣṇa... (aside:) Sit like this. Yes. Puṇḍarīkākṣam. //Puṇḍarīka// means lotus; //akṣam// means eyes. Puṇḍarīkākṣam. //Yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa bahyābhyantara-śuciḥ.// Externally, internally, he becomes immediately purified. So keep on chanting, you keep yourself purified, //māyā// cannot touch you. //Māyā's// contamination will not touch you. Just like if you take vaccine, the infectious disease will not touch you. Similarly, if you keep yourself vaccinated with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the //māyā// has no power to touch you. And if you can keep, then you will be accustomed. Just like a child, when he learns walking, he requires little help. He may fall down, but that doesn't matter. He again stands up. Similarly, in the beginning there may be childlike falldown, but if you stick to the position, then one day you'll be able to walk freely, without any hamper. So this //mantra, apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthām,// any condition of life, you can simply remember Puṇḍarīkākṣam, Kṛṣṇa. As soon as you chant "Kṛṣṇa," you remember everything.

So this remembering is the whole thing. If you have got always within your heart Kṛṣṇa, by sound or by mental thoughts, by work, some way or other, by reading books, any way, if simply you keep your consciousness in Kṛṣṇa, then your life is successful. That's all. And in the //Bhagavad-gītā// such person who is keeping always Kṛṣṇa within himself, he's certified as the greatest of all yogis. //Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ,// "Of all the yogis," //mad-gatenāntarātmanā,// "simply who is keeping Me within his heart..."

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

"He's first-class yogi." You don't require to labor and pay somewhere some five dollars, ten dollars, and practice this gymnastic. No. It is not possible. And as soon as you come out, you'll again engage yourself in all nonsense activities. No. The first-class yoga system is to keep yourself always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then it is always, you are pure. No contamination of this material world can touch you, and you are first-class yogi. All right. (chants fire sacrifice prayers responsively with devotees) Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)
