====== Purport to Hari Hari Biphale ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//...biphale janama goṅāinu.// This is a song sung by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, a very stalwart //ācārya// in the line of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //sampradāya,// disciplic succession. He has sung many songs, important songs, and his songs are accepted as Vedic conclusion. [break] ...very authoritative songs. So he says, praying to Lord Kṛṣṇa, "My dear Lord," hari hari, "I have simply spoiled my life." //Hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu.// Why you have spoiled your life? He says, //manuṣya-janama pāiyā,// "I got this human form of life," //rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,// "but I did not care to worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Therefore I have spoiled my life." And how it is? It is exactly like one takes poison knowingly. If somebody takes poison unknowingly, there is excuse, but if somebody takes poison knowingly, it is suicidal. So he says that "I have committed suicide simply by not worshiping Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa in this human form of life."

Then he says, //golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.// This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, saṅkīrtana movement, is nothing material. It is directly imported from the spiritual kingdom known as Goloka Vṛndāvana. So //golokera prema-dhana.// And it is not ordinary song. It is just the treasure of love of Godhead. So... "But I have no attraction for this." //Rati nā janmilo kene tāy.// "I have no attraction for it. On the contrary," //viṣaya-biṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jwale,// "and because I did not accept it, therefore the blazing fire of the poison of material existence is constantly burning me." //Dibā-niśi hiyā jwale.// "Day and night, my heart is burning on account of this poisonous effect of material existence." And //taribare nā koinu upāy.// "But I did not seek any remedy for this." In other words, the remedy for this blazing fire of material existence is this //saṅkīrtana// movement. It is imported from the spiritual kingdom. And who has imported it? Or who has brought it?

Then he says, //brajendra-nandana jei, śaci-suta hoilo sei. Brajendra-nandana,// the son of King of Braja. That is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is known as son of Nanda Mahārāja. He was King of Brajabhūmi. So //brajendra-nandana jei,// the same personality who was formerly the son of Nanda Mahārāja has now appeared as the son of Mother Śacī. //Śacī-suta hoilo sei.// And //balarāma hoilo nitāi.// And Lord Balarāma has become Nityānanda. So these two brothers adventing, they are delivering all kinds of fallen souls. //Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo.// As many fallen souls there were within this world, they're delivering them simply by this chanting procession. //Hari-nāme uddhārilo,// simply by this chanting. How it is possible? Then he says, //tāra sākṣī jagāi// and //mādhāi.// The living example is the two brothers, Jagāi and Mādhāi. These Jagāi and Mādhāi, two brothers, they happened to be born in a //brāhmaṇa// family but they turned to be debauch number one. And... Of course, nowadays, in this age, their qualification is not considered debauch. Their debauchery was because they were drunkard and woman hunter. Therefore they were called debauch. And meat-eater also. So... But they became later on delivered by Lord Caitanya and Nityānanda. Great devotees.

So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's explanation says that in this age although people are drunkard, woman-hunter, meat-eater, and all..., gambler, all kinds of sinful actor, still, if they take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, they'll be delivered, undoubtedly. This is the blessings of Lord Caitanya. Then Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura prays, //hā hā prabhu nanda-suta, vṛṣabhānu-sutā-juta.// "My dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, You are son of King Nanda, and Your consort Rādhārāṇī is the daughter King Vṛṣabhānu. So You are together here standing." //Narottama dāsa kahe, nā ṭheliho rāṅgā pāy,// "Now I am surrendering unto You, please do not kick me away or push me away with Your lotus feet because I have no other shelter. I am just taking shelter unto Your lotus feet without having any other means. So please accept me and deliver me." This is the sum and substance of this song. [end]
