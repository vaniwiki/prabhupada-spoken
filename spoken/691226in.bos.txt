====== Initiation Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So this chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is purifying your existence. //Yasmād śuddhyed sattvam. Sattvam// means existence. You are existing, I am existing, God is existing eternally. The temporary existence that we see at the present moment, this is not our existence. This is our diseased condition, crazy condition. //Piśācī pāile yena mati-cchana haya. Piśācī// means ghost or witches. When one is haunted by ghost he becomes upset of his own consciousness and talks all kinds of nonsense. Similarly, when our existence is covered by the material ghost we talk so many nonsense: "I am this body, and anything in relationship with this body is mine. I am dying. I belong to this family. I belong to this community, nation, this, that, planet." These are all just like a man haunted by ghost speaks nonsense, these are all nonsense. And the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to cure this disease. //Śuddhyed sattvam,// existence. That is called //svarūpa,// real identification. //Mukti. Mukti// means... This word is very popular, //mukti,// liberation. What is that liberation? Liberation means to come to this platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is liberation. //Svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. //Mukti// is defined in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: muktir hitvānyathā rūpam. Muktir hitvā anyathā rūpam. Anyathā rūpam. Rūpam// means form. We are in a form which is not liberated form. Material form. This form which we have got just now, this form, when it will be finished, you'll never get this form. Another form. Another. Just like bubbles. Bubbles in the ocean, they come out. You cannot have the exact same bubbles, same measurement. No. That is going on. Similarly, this //rūpam// is //anyathā.// This is not our //rūpam,// our form. Therefore sometimes in Vedic literature it is stated, "formless." Formless does not mean has no form. Not this form. That is formless. But people with less intelligence, they think formless means there's no form. Formless means not this form. This is //anyathā rūpam.// This is different from our real form. So //mukti// means to give up this unreal form and accept your real form. Just like freedom from disease. Get free from the diseased condition and come to real healthy life.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for bringing men to the real life. Always remember this. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. It takes... Just like to cure a disease it takes little time. But if you take to the process of cure, then that is very good. In the //Bhagavad-gītā,// Bhagavān, the Personality of Godhead says,

> api cet su-durācāro
> bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
> sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ
> samyag vyavasito hi saḥ
> [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]

//Kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā śaśvac-chāntiṁ nigacchati.// Those who have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously, even there are some faults, still, they are saintly persons. That is the recommendation of Kṛṣṇa. Because that fault may be due to his past habits, but that is being stopped. Just like you make the switch off, no more electric current will act, but the fan still gives some rounds due to the past force. Similarly, a Kṛṣṇa consciousness person, even if he's found in fault, Kṛṣṇa says, "No." //Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. "He's saintly person, //sādhu.//" Why? Now, the process he has taken up, that will cure him in due course of time. //Śaṣvac-chāntiṁ nigacchati.// So these who have fortunately come to this platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness by association, by practice, this is the way. So stick to it. Don't go away. Even if you find some fault, don't go away from the association. Struggle, and Kṛṣṇa will help you.

So this initiation process means beginning of this life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And we shall try to be situated in our original consciousness. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. Real consciousness, as it is recommended by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that He identifies Himself as eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and this is liberation, and this is //mukti.// If you simply stick to this principle, //gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]], that "I am nothing except the eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa," then you are in the liberated platform. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice. You keep yourself. And for keeping yourself in that consciousness, the simple method is this chanting, Hare Kṛṣṇa. You keep yourself chanting as many hours, twenty-four hours. Why as many hours? Twenty-four hours. //Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]. Lord Caitanya says, "This is to be practiced twenty-four hours." And that you can do. It requires simply practice. Even in sleeping you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Even in sleeping. And there is no bar. In sleeping, in eating, in going to the toilet room, there is no restriction. You can go on, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." You see. That will keep you in your //svarūpa,// in your real identification, and you'll never be attacked by //māyā.// Just like if you keep yourself vaccinated and if the period... What is called? Active. Then there is no fear of being infected. That is practical. If you get yourself vaccinated of certain type of infection and you keep yourself active... Just like doctors, they go, treat patients suffering from infectious disease, but they keep themselves always unaffected. They know the remedial measures, antiseptic, prophylactic processes. So this prophylactic antiseptic process is //Kṛṣṇa-kīrtanam. Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-kīrtanam.// That is Lord Caitanya's blessing. //Paraṁ vijayate.// All glories to the //saṅkīrtana, śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtana. Kīrtana// means //Kṛṣṇa-kīrtana.// Not any other //kīrtana.// The Māyāvādī philosophers, they introduce so many other //kīrtanas.// No. //Kīrtana// means //Kṛṣṇa-kīrtana:// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma... Or any name glorifying the name of the Lord. That is //kīrtana.// But this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is especially recommended in this age, and Lord Caitanya personally chanted, so we should follow. Although every name of Kṛṣṇa is as potent as the name Kṛṣṇa... Viṣṇu name, or there are thousands and thousands of names... //Nāmnām akāri bahudhā. Bahudhā// means there is no counting. Innumerable names. And each name has the same potency like Kṛṣṇa. But this is recommended, especially, those who take advantage. This is one thing.

And other thing, to take precaution so that //māyā// may not attack you. You should be cautious also. And therefore we have to follow the four regulative principles: no illicit sex life and no meat-eating or nonvegetarian diet... We have no quarrel with vegetarian and nonvegetarian. We are after //Kṛṣṇa-prasādam.// If Kṛṣṇa accepts something beyond these vegetarian dishes, then we can accept also. But Kṛṣṇa says, "No. Give Me //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]." Kṛṣṇa can eat everything. He is God. But He says that "Give Me this." //Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam.// "Offer Me this flower, fruit, water. Like that." So we are after //Kṛṣṇa-prasādam.// That is our motto. We don't fight with vegetarian and non... We are not making propaganda... Just like there is vegetarian society. No. We have no business. Even if a man becomes vegetarian, what does he gain? In this material world, either vegetarian or nonvegetarian, they are on the same platform, birds of the same feather. You see? So that is not our propaganda. We are introducing //Kṛṣṇa-prasāda;// therefore we invite people to take nice //prasāda.// So these four principles we should follow. We shall not accept anything which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa. That is our position. And no illicit sex life, no gambling, no intoxication. We are already intoxicated, being haunted by the ghost of //māyā.// And further intoxication...? Do you think intoxication can be cured by intoxication? No. That is not possible. So these four rules you have to follow. And you keep to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then your life is sublime. Very simple thing. Very simple thing. But it is simple for the simple, but it is very hard for the crooked. Yes. So those who are going to be initiated, they should always remember these restrictive four rules and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa at least sixteen rounds, and eat //Bhagavat-prasādam, Kṛṣṇa-prasādam,// and be happy, dance. That's all. Is there any difficulty?

**Devotees:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughter] No difficulty. And people will write, "the bright-faced." Yes. They have to admit it. Because it is purifying. There is no impurity. Without being pure, how can you expect to reach God? This is all rascaldom. To keep oneself dirty, impure in mind, in body, in feeling, in character, and you want to go to God? Rascal. [laughter] Forget! There is no entrance for you to God.

> yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra-marutaḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair
> vedaiḥ sāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadair gāyanti yaṁ sāma-gāḥ
> dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yogino
> yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇā devāya tasmai namaḥ

God's position is that, that the yogis, they are trying to capture God by meditation. And demigods like Brahmā, Lord Śiva and others, they are offering Vedic prayers. And the //Sāma Veda// is always singing the glories of the Lord. The Lord is so exalted, so pure. So if you have to reach Kṛṣṇa, you must be pure, cent percent pure. And that is not very difficult. This //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and you become purified, purified, more, more, more, more. And day will come when you find that you are completely pure from all material contamination and you become eligible to enter into the kingdom of God, and that makes a solution of all problems.

So it is so nice. Always remember this, that "We have taken the best in the whole creation of the Lord, Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Do not try to adulterate it. Keep it pure, and your life will be successful. This is an opportunity, this human form of life, this particular type of tongue which you can use. In other type of tongues you can chew, you can taste the blood and the flesh, and so many things. But you cannot chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. But here is a tongue given by God. You can utilize it for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don't miss this opportunity. That chewing facility, tasting facility, you'll get even in cat's life, dog's life. But this chanting facility you'll not get. This is in this life, human form of life. So don't misuse it. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa regularly and be happy.

Thank you very much. [break]

> namaḥ apavitraḥ pavitraḥ vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gataḥ api vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa abhyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ
> śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu śrī viṣṇu

[devotees repeat] So //mantra// means... //Namaḥ. Nama// means surrender, to become submissive. //Namanta eva. Namanta eva.// That is the qualification. //Namaḥ.// When we utter this word //namaḥ,// means "I surrender." Anyone, I say //namaskāra, namaskāra// means the surrendering process: "I accept the surrendering process." So when we surrender to Kṛṣṇa or His representative, then //apavitraḥ. Apavitraḥ// means contaminated and //pavitraḥ// means purified. So one may be in contaminated stage or purified stage. It doesn't matter. One who... //Yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣam,// one who remembers Kṛṣṇa, the lotus-eyed... //Puṇḍarīkākṣam// means lotus-eyed Kṛṣṇa. So //bahya. Bahya// means externally, and //abhyantara,// internally. //Bahyābhyantara-śuciḥ. Śuciḥ// means purified. And another meaning of //śuciḥ// is //brāhmaṇa.// A //brāhmaṇa// means purified. So those who are going to be sacred-threaded today, they should remember that they are being accepted as //śuciḥ,// as //brāhmaṇa.// After chanting process for the six months or one year, it is supposed that he has already become purified. Now he should be recognized that he is purified. So this sacred thread means recognition. Sacred thread means one should understand... Just like one understands a man [is] learned by the degrees M.A., B.A., or Ph.D., similarly, when there is sacred thread, it is understood that he has undergone the purificatory process under superior management, or guidance of spiritual master. This is called //upanayana, upanayana,// in Sanskrit. //Upanayana:// bringing him more near. The initiation is the beginning of purification, and offering the sacred thread means bringing him more nearer. Therefore the principle is those who are ordinarily initiated, they should not touch the Deity. Only those who are in sacred thread, they should touch. This is the system.

But //Kṛṣṇa-kīrtana// is so nice that even without sacred thread, because he is regularly chanting, he is to be supposed to be purified. That is the recommendation given by Jīva Gosvāmī. Anyone who is chanting regularly Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra... Śvādo 'pi sadyaḥ savanāya kalpate. Śvādaḥ. Śvā// means dog, and //adaḥ, adaḥ// means eating. Dog-eaters. The dog-eaters are considered to be the lowest of the mankind. But in the //Bhāgavata// says that //śvādo 'pi sadyaḥ savanāya kalpate.// Even if he is dog-eater, but by this process he immediately becomes qualified to offer sacrifice. //Savanāya.// This fire sacrifice is called //savanāya.// And Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī gives notes on this line that a person born in the family of a //brāhmaṇa// awaits the sacred thread ceremony. But one who has become surely [?] purified by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// he immediately becomes a highly qualified //brāhmaṇa.// So don't misuse the opportunity obtained by you. Use it properly, and the life will be successful. So //apavitraḥ pavitro vā.// In any condition of life, anyone who remembers Kṛṣṇa, //Puṇḍarīkākṣam,// so both wise-externally and internally---he becomes purified, //śuci. Śuci// means pure. And there is a verse written by one Vaiṣṇava in Bengali. Not ordinary. He's Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura is one of the //ācāryas.// He has written //Caitanya-Bhāgavata.// As there is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata,// he has written //Caitanya-Bhāgavata.// Perhaps you have heard the name. So his opinion is, //muci haya śuci haya yadi kṛṣṇa bhaje. Muci// and //śuci,// just opposite. //Muci// means the most nasty cobbler. He eats everything and does all nonsense. He is called //muci. Muci// means cobbler. In India, when a cow or bull dies, these //muci// class are called to take away the carcass. So they take it away and they take out the skin and tan it for... This is the original system of shoe-making. And make some shoes and sell in the market. But not by killing cows. When it dies. So this business is done by the //muci// class. And they take the flesh also. After taking out the skin, the flesh they take. Therefore they are considered very low class, //muci.// And //śuci// means //brāhmaṇa.// So Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura says, //muci haya śuci haya.// A cobbler, //muci,// can become a //śuci, yadi kṛṣṇa bhaje,// if he's Kṛṣṇa conscious. That's all. If he's Kṛṣṇa conscious, never mind he is a cobbler, he becomes immediately //brāhmaṇa. Muci haya śuci haya yadi kṛṣṇa bhaje. Śuci haya muci haya yadi kṛṣṇa tyaje.// And even if he's born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, if he gives up Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he's immediately cobbler. So don't lose this opportunity. Always remember Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa. [laughter] Don't become cobbler. [break]

[leads devotees in prayers for fire sacrifice] Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [all chant //japa//] [break] [//kīrtana//] Now this flower has to be... You can offer //puṣpāñjali// to Guru Mahārāja. Yes. Get some pots. Yes. Get out all these flowers. [end]
