====== Śrī Īśopaniṣad Invocation Lecture ======

**Gargamuni:**
It's on page twelve, almost in the middle. The second paragraph. "The universe has its own time, fixed by the energy of the complete whole, and when that time is complete, this temporary manifestation will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everything in this material world, it has got a fixed time. And within that fixed time there are six kinds of changes. First birth, then growth, then to stay, then to produce by-product, then dwindling, then vanish. This is the law of material nature. This flower takes birth, just like a bud, then grows, then stays for two, three days, then it produces a seed, by-product, then dries up gradually, then finish. [aside:] You sit down like this. So this is called //ṣaḍ-vikāra,// six kinds of changes. So you cannot stop this by your so-called material science. No. This is //avidyā.// People are trying to save themselves, and sometimes talking foolishly that by scientific knowledge man will be immortal. You cannot stop the process of the material laws. Therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. The process of material nature, which is composed of three qualities---//sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa... Tri-guṇa.// Another meaning of //guṇa// is rope. Just like you have seen rope, they're twisted in three process. First of all thin rope, then three of them, they are rolled, then again three of them rolled, then again three. It becomes very strong. So these three qualities, //sattva, raja, tamo-guṇa,// they are mixed up. Again they produce some by-product, again mixed up, again mixed up. In this way eighty-one times they're twisted. So //guṇamayī māyā,// binding you more and more. So you cannot get out of this binding of this material world. Binding. So therefore it is called //apavarga.// This process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness means nullifying the //pavarga// process.

Yesterday I was explaining what is this //pavarga// to Gargamuni. This //pavarga// means the line of the alphabet //pa.// You know, those who have studied this //devanāgarī.// There are //devanāgarī// alphabets, //ka kha ga gha na ca cha ja jha na.// In this way five set, one line. Then come the fifth set, comes //pa pha va bha ma.// So this //pavarga// means //pa.// First of all //pa. Pa// means //parābhava,// defeat. Everyone is trying, struggling very hard to survive, but defeated. First //pavarga. Pa// means //parābhava.// And then //pha. Pha// means foaming. Just like horse, when working very hard, you'll find some foams coming out of the mouth, we sometimes also, when we are very tired after working very hard, the tongue becomes dry and some foam comes. So everyone is working very hard for sense gratification, but defeated. The //pa, pha,// and //va. Va// means this bondage. So first //pa,// second //pha,// the bondage third, then //va, bha. Bha// means beating, fearfulness. And then //ma. Ma// means //mrtyu,// or death. So this Kṛṣṇa conscious process is //apavarga, apa. A// means none. //Pavarga,// these are the symptoms of this material world. And when you add this word //a, apavarga,// that means it is nullified.

So... [aside:] You can sit down. This //apavarga-vartmani.// Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the path of //apavarga,// nullifying these //pavargas.//

//Satāṁ prasaṅgān.// This discussion, this is called //satāṁ prasaṅgān,// discussion. Just like there are many conferences, assembly, they have got different types of talks. Just like we were discussing last week, //śrotavyādīni rājendra...// [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]], //apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām.// Discussion. Those who are blind for self-realization, they do not take care, they have got many things to discuss. But so far Kṛṣṇa conscious people are concerned, their subject matter of discussion is one: //apavarga-vartmani,// the path of disintegration. How it is happen? //Satāṁ prasaṅgān.// When you form this society, Kṛṣṇa conscious society, and you discuss about this //apavarga// from the authoritative literature, just we are doing, then it becomes relishable. You cannot discuss all these thing with a storekeeper. That will be not relishable. //Satāṁ prasaṅgān,// amongst the devotees. If you take this //Īśopaniṣad// and you ask one butcher or a man like that, "Come on. We shall discuss," he'll throw away. The other day we were coming on this Venice Boulevard. Gargamuni gave one card to a boy. You remember? [laughs] He immediately threw away. They have no taste. So you cannot discuss all this transcendental knowledge with these demons. //Satāṁ prasaṅgān.// Therefore you have to discuss... Therefore we are opening so many centers, that people may take advantage of his society. Because anywhere else he'll not have the opportunity. His life is being spoiled. The modern civilization is like that. It is a killing civilization, //ātma-hā. Ātma-hano janāḥ.// All these people are killing themselves because they do not know what is life; simply like animal or living. The animal does not know what is life, but he is under the laws of nature, evolution, going on. But when you get this human form of life, there is responsibility. You have to chalk out. Here is a chance you can become Kṛṣṇa conscious and make your life solve all problems. If not, then again go to the cycle of birth and death again, 8,400,000. It will take many, many millions of years again to come back. Just like the sunshine you will see after twelve hours, twenty-four hours, morning. Everything is a process. Process. So if you lose this opportunity of elevating yourself, then again you come to the process. Nature's law is very strong. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. The sooner you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.// Such person is able to overcome this process of material nature.

So here it is said the universe has its own time, fixed by the energy of the complete whole. Universe is also big gigantic body, material body. That's all. Just like your body; everything is relative. Modern science, the law of relativity. An atom, a small particle, small ant, so it has got a relative life, you have got relative life. Similarly this gigantic body, it may be many millions of years this universe will exist, but it will not exist forever. That is a fact. Because it is very gigantic, therefore it may remain for some millions of years, but it will end. That is the law of nature. And when that time is complete, this temporary manifestation will be annihilated by the complete arrangement of the complete, the supreme complete. When your time will be complete, no more, sir, in this body. Nobody can check. The arrangement is so strong. You cannot say, "Let me remain." Actually it happens. When I was in India, Allahabad, one of our, an old friend, he was very rich man. So he was dying. So he was requesting the doctor, "Can you not give me at least four years to live? I have got some plan, you see. I could not finish it." You see. //Āśā-pāśa-śatair baddhāḥ.// This is demonic. Everyone thinks that "Oh, I have to do this. I have to do this." No. The doctors or doctors' fathers or his father, no scientist can check. "Oh, no, sir. No four years. Not even four minutes. You have to go immediately." This is the law. So before that moment comes, one should be very dexterous to realize Kṛṣṇa conscious. //Tūrṇam yateta. Tūrṇam// means very swiftly, very quickly you should realize Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Anu...// Next, before the death, next death comes, you must finish your business. That is intelligence. Otherwise defeat.

Thank you. [end]
