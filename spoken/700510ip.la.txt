====== Śrī Īśopaniṣad, Mantra 7 ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Now this verse, verse number 7,

> yasmin sarvāṇi bhūtāni
> ātmaivābhūd vijānataḥ
> tatra ko mohaḥ kaḥ śoka
> ekatvam anupaśyataḥ
>[[books:iso:7|[Īśo 7]]]

This is the perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Ekatvam anupaśyataḥ.// A Kṛṣṇa conscious person sees oneness; all living entities, they see one. Just like fire and the sparks, although there are different types of illuminating properties, the whole thing is seen as one. Similarly, these diversities in unity. Diversities means the expansion of different energies of Kṛṣṇa. That is diversity. Otherwise, the one: Kṛṣṇa, only Kṛṣṇa. //Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ tathaiva akhilaṁ jagat.// The whole universe, //parasya brahmaṇaḥ śakti... Parasya,// the Supreme Brahman, Parameśvara, //īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1], His energy.

The example is just like fire. Fire has got many energies, especially heat and light. Wherever there is fire, there is heat and there is light. Now this heat is not different from the fire, and the light is not different from the fire, but still heat and light is not fire. The... From the fire, there is heat. So if you are heated, if you are getting warmth from the fire, fireplace, that does not mean you are sitting on the fire. But at the same time, that warmth of the fire, the heat of the fire, is not different from the fire. In this way you have to understand the whole universe. Nothing is different from Kṛṣṇa, but still, Kṛṣṇa is not everywhere. This philosophy... Therefore this very word is used here, //vijānataḥ. Vijānataḥ// means one who knows, knower of things, how they are manifested. When one understands that things are manifested in this system exactly like the fire, heat and light... Fire is the original cause of heat and light. Similarly, whatever we see within this universe, within material world and spiritual world, the spiritual world is expansion of Kṛṣṇa's internal energy, and this material world is Kṛṣṇa's expansion of external energy, and we living entities, we are expansion of marginal energy. So three energies. He has got multi-energies. All the multi-energies grouped in three headings: //antaraṅga-śakti, bahiraṅga-śakti, taṭasthā-śakti. Antaraṅga-śakti// means internal energy, //bahiraṅga śakti// means external energy, and //taṭasthā-śakti// means these living entities. We are //śakti;// we are energy. We are not the energetic. The Māyāvādī philosopher says that because the energies are not outside Brahman, therefore they're all the same. This is monism. Our Vaiṣṇava philosophy is that energy [is] simultaneously one and different. When you perceive heat, we understand, "Oh, there is fire." But that does not mean that because I am getting some heat, I am on the fire. Try to understand this philosophy. Therefore here it is said //vijānataḥ.//

So their //ekatvam,// Māyāvāda philosophy's //ekatvam,// oneness, and our //ekatvam// of oneness---a little different. They say that the energy's false; the Brahman is real. //Brahmā satyaṁ jagan mithyā.// We say that because Brahman is truth, therefore His energy's also truth. That is the difference between Vaiṣṇava philosophy and Māyāvāda philosophy. We cannot say that energy is false. Energy is temporary; this external energy is temporary, not false. Although... Suppose we have got some trouble. There are so many kinds of troubles pertaining to the body, mind, external affairs. But that trouble comes and goes. But when the trouble is there, it is true. We feel the consequence. We cannot say it is false. The Māyāvādī philosophers say that it is false. But when he's troubled, why he's so much disturbed? So that is not false. Therefore this very word is used: //vijānataḥ,// "one who knows." Perfect knowledge must be there, //vijānataḥ.// When one is actual knower of the things, //tatra ko mohaḥ,// then there is no illusion. Illusion is for him who does not know things. But one who knows, there is no illusion. //Tatra ko mohaḥ kaḥ śoka.// No lamentation. When you are perfectly in conviction that there is nothing except Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa's energy, the same, then there is no //moha---moha// means illusion---and //śoka.//

Moha and //śoka,// this is also explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā: brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. We were very much anxious to get things which you haven't got. That is //kāṅkṣati,// hankering after. And when things are lost, we lament. But if we know that Kṛṣṇa is the central point, so anything received, gained, profited, that is Kṛṣṇa's desire. Kṛṣṇa has given; accept it. And if it is taken away by Kṛṣṇa, then what is the lamentation? Kṛṣṇa liked to take it away from me. Oh, why should I lament? Because //ekatvam,// the supreme one, He's the cause of all causes. He's taking; He's also giving. So when you have got something, engage it in Kṛṣṇa's service. And we have no, nothing to offer Kṛṣṇa, then whatever you get, //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]], Kṛṣṇa is satisfied in every way. This is the meaning of //vijānataḥ.// One must be in the full knowledge. Then there will be no more lamentation and no more hankering. That is the stage of spiritual platform.

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati ne kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu...
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

Then you can see everyone on the same platform, that everyone is a spiritual spark. //Na vijugupsate.// Then you do not say, "Oh, he's lower; he's higher. He's intelligent; he is fool." That is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā: paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. //Paṇḍitāḥ// means learned. He's //vijānataḥ,// one who knows. So in the Vedic literature you won't find something different in //Bhagavad-gītā// and some things different in //Īśopaniṣad// or something is different in the //Vedas.// No. They are the same things explained in different languages in different scriptures. But one has to know the art, how to understand them.

Thank you very much. [end]
