====== Śrī Īśopaniṣad, Mantra 8 ======

[Prabhupāda and devotees chant Invocation and verses 1–7]

**Prabhupāda:**
Again, from the beginning. [devotees repeat] Thank you very much. [break]

//Apāpa-viddham// [[books:iso:8|[Īśo 8]]]. This is most important part of this verse. No sin can pollute Kṛṣṇa. There is nothing sinful for Kṛṣṇa. How it is? The example is given generally, just like the sun. There is no contamination for the sun. There is no possibility of the sun being contaminated, or the sun being dark. This is a material thing. So how Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, He can be contaminated by any kind of sinful action? God is good. There cannot be any sinful action. Sometimes less intelligent class of men, they criticize Kṛṣṇa, "Why Kṛṣṇa did it?" Yes, Kṛṣṇa is God. He can do anything, whatever He likes. Your laws cannot restrict Kṛṣṇa. You may... For you there may be so many restrictive laws, but for Kṛṣṇa there is no restrictive law. He can surpass all restrictive regulations. This question was put to Parīkṣit Mahārāja after //rasa-līlā// that "Kṛṣṇa came to establish the principles of moral and religious life. How He enjoyed the company of so many young girls who were not...? They were wives of other persons. So how it is so?" So the answer was given that Kṛṣṇa cannot be contaminated. Rather, anything comes to Kṛṣṇa, even with contaminated mind, becomes purified. The same example: the sun cannot be contaminated, but anything contaminated, if you put into the sunshine, it becomes purified. So you approach Kṛṣṇa with any desire... //Akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā// [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]. The //gopīs...// Of course, that is not this material thing. Still, as young girls, they were captivated by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa. So they approached Kṛṣṇa with a view to accept Him as paramour. But actually, they became purified.

So some way or other, if we can develop our Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then immediately we become purified. That is the process. Kṛṣṇa gives chance to everyone. Just like Kaṁsa. Kaṁsa was thinking of Kṛṣṇa. He was also Kṛṣṇa conscious, always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, "Oh, how shall I find out Kṛṣṇa? I shall kill Him." That was his business. That is the asuric mentality. //Āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.// But he also became purified. He got salvation. The same example again: somehow or other, if you come to the sunlight, you become purified and you get warmth. Not that sun becomes contaminated by you. No. That is not possible. Sun is so powerful that even you are contaminated... You cannot contaminate the sun. //Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya// [SB 10.33.29]. When one is very powerful, there is no contamination. Therefore here it is said, //apāpa-viddhaṁ śuddham.// Always purified, Kṛṣṇa. This is also explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā// when Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa, //paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān:// "You are the supreme pure." //Pavitraṁ paramam.//

So same thing is here. The Vedic literature is not contradictory. Whatever you find in //Brahma-saṁhitā,// the same thing you'll find in //Īśopaniṣad,// the same thing you'll find //Bhagavad-gītā,// same thing you'll find in other Vedic literature. It is our misunderstanding that we, sometimes we cannot understand. Otherwise, it is always the same truth spoken everywhere.

Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant. [//kīrtana//] [end]
