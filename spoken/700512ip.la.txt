**Prabhupada:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare, Hare Rama Hare Rama... OM [Chanting of verses] This verse is little difficult, [chuckle] so chant and it will come, yes, //abhyāsa-yogena, abhyāsa-yogena,// Arjuna said that it is impossible for me, so Kṛṣṇa said, //abhyāsa-yogena. Abhyāsa-yogena// means practising repeated, //abhyāsa-yogena// so everything is possible by //abhyāsa-yoga.// Yoga, you have heard the name of yoga, practicing is also yoga. //abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā// [[books:bg:8:8|[Bg. 8.8]]], one who practice. One who practices continually and does not allow the mind to go anywhere he becomes successful. //Abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā...// [continues chanting verse, etc].

So this verse, you'll read what is important. "Such person must know in fact the greatest of all, who is unembodied, omniscient..." That is the distinction between God and ourself. We are embodied. This body is different from me; therefore when I leave this body, this body becomes "Dust thou art, dust thou..." That thou means this body. I am not dust. I am spirit soul. So Kṛṣṇa is not embodied. He has no difference between His body and His soul. His soul and body, the same. He does not change His body, because He hasn't got material body. And because He does not change body, He remembers everything. We change body; therefore we do not remember what had happened in our last birth. We have forgotten who was... Just like even in sleep, when we forget our body, we forget our all, I mean to say, environments. While sleeping or dreaming, you are in a dreamland. You don't remember even that you have got this body. Every day, every night, this is being experienced. Because this body, I'm not body. The body becomes tired. It sleeps or it is inactive. But as I am, I work, I dream, I go somewhere, I fly, or I go, I create another kingdom, another body, another environment. This we experience every day, every night. It is not difficult to understand. Similarly, in every life, we create a different environment. In this life I may think I am Indian. You may think you are American. Or next life, a different position. Next life, I may not be American, or I may not be Indian. And if I, even I, I become American, I may not be a man. I may be a cow or bull. Then I am sent to the slaughterhouse. You see? This is going on. This is the problem. Always changing bodies. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. It is serious position. We should very..., take this life very seriously, that "I'm changing my body life after life. I have no fixed position. I do not know where I am put within these 8,400,000 species of life. So I must make a solution." And that solution is... Kṛṣṇa says, //yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. //Mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam, nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ:// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]] "If anyone, some way or other, by developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he comes to Me, he hasn't got any more to go back and accept a material body." He gets the same body as Kṛṣṇa, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1].

So we should very seriously execute this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Without any deviation, very seriously. We should not be neglectful, that this is fashion or something imposed. No. This is the most important function. Human life is meant simply for developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He has no other business. But unfortunately we have created so many engagements so that we forget Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is called //māyā.// This is called //māyā.// We are forgetting our real business. We are engaged in different, so many businesses. Misleaders. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. The rascal, blind leaders are leading to hell. //Te 'pīśa tantryām uru-dāmni-baddhāḥ.// All of them are tied up by the stringent rules and regulations of the material nature. And they have become leader. They do not like any authority. This is called //māyā.// This is called //māyā.// They are being misled; still they are following that. This is called //māyā.//

So try, some way or other, you have come in contact with Kṛṣṇa. So catch Him very tightly. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.// If you catch very tightly Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, then //māyā// will not be able to do any harm.

Thank you very much. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
