====== Lecture [partially recorded] ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//...śikṣāṣṭaka. Śikṣa// means instruction, and //aṣṭaka// means eight. He has given us eight verses to understand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and I shall try to explain. Please hear attentively.

The first instruction is, the Lord says, //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. I think I have explained this several times. Again, repeatedly, just like we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa repeatedly. There is no, I mean to say, tiredsomeness. These boys, they can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// twenty-four hours, they will never get tired. They will dance and they will chant. And you also, if you try it you will never get tired. Because it is not material. In the material world if you chant anything, any favorite name for three, four, or ten times, you will get tired. Yes. That's a fact. But because it is not material, if you chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// you will never get tired. The more you chant, your heart will be cleansed from all material dirty things. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. And the problems of your life within this material world... These are simple words, but it requires lots of explanation. What is the problem of our life? That you do not know. The modern education never gives enlightenment what is the problem of life. That is indicated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that those who are educated, advancing in knowledge, they should know what is the problem of life. The problem of life is, as stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. One should always feel the inconvenience of taking birth, //janma; mṛtyu,// inconvenience of death; //jarā,// inconvenience of old age; and inconvenience of disease. //Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.//

So nobody is taking care. When they are diseased they think, "All right, I am diseased. Let me go to the doctor and he will give me some medicine, it will be cured." But he does not take seriously that "I did not want this disease. Why this disease is there? Is it not possible to make me free from the disease?" He never thinks. That means the intelligence is very low grade. Just like animal. Animal is suffering but it has no strength[?]. It is brought before the slaughterhouse. If the animal is seeing that another animal is being slaughtered before him, but still he is satisfied with a morsel of grass. He will stand there eating this grass. This is animal. [end]
