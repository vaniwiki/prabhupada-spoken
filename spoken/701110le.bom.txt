====== Lecture [partially recorded] ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...but //Vedas// indicate that He is the supreme eternal, //nityo nityānām.// There are many eternals, many millions and trillions of eternals, but He is the supreme eternal. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. He is the supreme living creature. He is also living. He is not dead.

**Devotee:**
//Haribol.//

**Prabhupāda:**
If He is not living, how this world is working? We have no eyes to see. //Bhagavad-gītā// says, //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]] "Under My superintendence." Background is God. Under His direction. In the Bible also it is said, "God created this." Yes. That's a fact. Not that there was, there might have been a chunk and it was spread like this and there was sun, there was... No. Actually //sa aikṣata.// In the //Vedas// also it is said, //sa aikṣata, sa// [indistinct]. So these are Vedic injunction. But this is fact, God created. So we have to open our eyes to see. That is //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. That is the process of cleansing your heart. If you cleanse your heart, then you will understand what Bible says, what //Veda// says. It requires to be purified. Just like a man suffering from jaundice, if you give him a piece of candy sugar, "Just taste it," he will say, "Oh, it is very bitter." But candy sugar is bitter? No. It is very sweet. And the medicine for jaundice disease is that sugar, that candy sugar. Modern science also prescribes, and it is prescribed in the Ayur Vedic medicine also. If he takes much quantity of this candy sugar water, then he becomes relieved from jaundice. And when he is relieved, then he says, "Oh, it is very sweet." The same thing. Same thing. So the modern disease of godless civilization, jaundice, can be cured by this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
