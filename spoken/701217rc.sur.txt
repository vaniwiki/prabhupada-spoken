====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the same...

**Guest [1] [Indian man]:**
Māyāvādīs may die like that, imagining... [Hindi] //Ara saba bhṛtya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They are after, inquiring after Brahmān, but nobody could give them. So they have got it. Now they are taking it. This is stage. [Hindi] That is the stage, //sannyāsa// stage. So these hippies, they are also giving up all work, that is //sannyāsa,// but there is no guide. There is no guide. And because they have no guide, therefore their intelligence is not being purified. Simply there is a propensity for renunciation, //tyāga.// But //tyāga...// [Hindi] After renunciation, what is the next stage, they do not know. That we are giving: "Yes, come here. Stand here." [laughs] Is it not?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes. Exactly.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are very successful. They are standing: "We don't want this." But they must stand. So they could not give the standing. But here is... Oh, here is standing. Therefore this movement is successful. They want some standing. And where is the standing? [Hindi] So unless you get a solid ground you cannot stand. You'll fall down.

**Guest [2] [Indian man]:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ. Kirāṭa-huṇāndhra-pulin...// Huh? [Hindi] [break] ...obeisance to guru. Then his guru, then his guru, up to Kṛṣṇa. [Hindi] //...paramparā// system. You cannot directly approach God. That is useless. You have no power to approach God directly. That is not possible. //Guru kṛṣṇa kṛpayā// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. [Hindi] Let them study this philosophy. We have got books, enough books. One cannot read all these books even throughout whole life. [break]

**Guest (2):**
I am going to...

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] You do actually work.

**Guest (2):**
So I can also accompany certain places like...

**Prabhupāda:**
You arrange. We can go there with all party. Now here in this part... You can get. This... Immediately we can go. From India...

**Guest (2):**
From India, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
We can go to Indonesia.

**Guest (2):**
At the end of March we can go there.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. You also come. Arrange like that. After finishing our program in Simla, let us go to Indonesia. You do it.

**Guest (2):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is a fact. At least at the present moment nobody can give better thing than what I am giving to the world. [Hindi]

**Guest (2):**
There are many things you can give us. I'll arrange the tour.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are present, a tourist program here?

**Guest (2):**
I was there. I...

**Prabhupāda:**
So this program...

**Guest (2):**
I wanted to join with the camp in the public but nobody was convenienced...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you could have informed him. You could come to the pal... Anyway, next, next, tomorrow also we'll have.

**Guest (2):**
I no way want to disturb...

**Hamsadutta:**
No, you won't disturb. You'll enhance us.

**Guest (2):**
Tomorrow I'll come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where you are staying here? [break] ...actually inquisitive, he'll capture it. It is not the question of... Japan. [break] ...personal ambition. It is service to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wants. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. So we are canvassing.

**Guest (2):**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That word, that //brahma-jijñāsā,// that is the position of the whole world. Yes, that is the position. They have enough seen about this material nonsense. Now that is the position. They want to know what is this Brahman.

**Guest (2):**
It is called Treta-yuga.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, this is not this //yuga.// This is called Kali-yuga. But... Then it will come, Satya-yuga. And that is long, long after, 400,000's of years after. [laughs] Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [end]
