====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.2.5–8 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> yasyāṅke śira ādhāya
> lokaḥ svapiti nirvṛtaḥ
> svayaṁ dharmam adharmaṁ vā
> na hi veda yathā paśuḥ

> sa kathaṁ nyarpitātmānaṁ
> kṛta-maitram acetanam
> visrambhaṇīyo bhūtānāṁ
> saghṛṇo dogdhum arhati
> [[books:sb:6:2:5-6|[SB 6.2.5-6]]]

[microphone moves] Is that all right? //Visvasena nitaram arpita ātmā yenārtham visrambhaṇīyo visva-saghṛṇiya visva-saniya saghṛṇasya.[?]//

> sa kathaṁ nyarpitātmānaṁ
> kṛta-maitram acetanam
> visrambhaṇīyo bhūtānāṁ
> saghṛṇo dogdhum arhati

So the Yamadūta is comparing the trustworthy government. Everything is discussed in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// but people do not take advantage of all these instructions. They mean... //Bhāgavatam// means that //rāsa-līlā,// that's all. So many nice instructions are there in different cantos. Actually, the Kṛṣṇa is described in the Tenth Canto, and other nine cantos are specially meant for purifying the heart and understanding real Kṛṣṇa, //tattvataḥ,// as it is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// They do not know. Those who take advantage of Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā// only as ordinary story, they do not know Kṛṣṇa //tattvataḥ.// But even though they do not know, because they are hearing about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, they are also becoming purified. But if they hear from authorized source, then the result will be //bhaktiṁ parāṁ bhagavati bhagavati pratilabhya.// They will be promoted to transcendental devotional platform, and the result will be that //hṛd-roga-kāmam apahinoti.//

Actually, by hearing about //rāsa-līlā// the result will be that one will be raised to the platform of transcendental service, and the disease of lust within the heart---that is material disease---that will be completely vanquished. //Hṛd-roga-kāmam apahinoti aciram. Aciram,// very soon, they will be able to eradicate the deep-rooted lusty desires in the heart of material existence. Material existence means lusty life. //Kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare.// Material life means simply to desire to enjoy. Of course, there is no enjoyment. That is... So if one hears //rāsa-līlā// from authoritative source, the result will be that he will be promoted to the transcendental platform of loving service to Kṛṣṇa. And the material disease, lusty desires, will be vanquished. But they do not hear from the authoritative source. Some professional reciters they hear; therefore they remain in the material existence of lusty affairs and sometimes they turn to be //sahajiyā.// When Kṛṣṇa had connection with so many women... You know that in Vṛndāvana, the "//yugala-bhajana//"---one becomes Kṛṣṇa and one becomes Rādhā. That is their theory. And so many things are going on. Therefore we instruct that first of all read the nine chapters very carefully, and then... There are so many nice instructions, but they do not hear about this nice instruction, //ajāmila-śraddhā caritra.// At least, picked up, some incidences, they should hear.

So,

> ayaṁ hi kṛta-nirveśo
> janma-koṭy-aṁhasām api
> yad vyājahāra vivaśo
> nāma svasty-ayanaṁ hareḥ
> [[books:sb:6:2:7|[SB 6.2.7]]]

The charge of Viṣṇudūtas for the Yamadūta was that they did not know whom to arrest and whom not to arrest. Therefore he was criticizing. Yamarāja is meant for arresting the criminals, sinful persons. But these Yamadūtas came to arrest Ajāmila, who was already relieved from all sinful actions simply by chanting "Nārāyaṇa." That was not known to them. So in order to criticize them, that "You do not know where to go and where not to go," they described in so many ways. Now they are positively saying that //ayaṁ hi kṛta-nirveśo janma-koṭy-aṁhasām api:// "Even though he committed sinful activity for millions of years, he is now free." //Ayaṁ hi kṛta-nirveśaḥ:// "He has completely counteracted all those sinful activities." How? //Yad vyājahāra vivaśo nāma svasty-ayanaṁ hareḥ.// So //vivaśaḥ:// "Somehow or other, he has chanted the holy name of Hari." //Asya pāpena daṇḍe kim artham akrośa kriyate tatrāhur ayaṁ hriyate:[?]// [commentary] "Why you are attempting to arrest this person as criminal?" Yamadūta, //yad yada vivaśi 'pi harer nāma vyājahāra uccaritavan:[?]// "There was no intention of chanting the holy name of Hari, but even though consciously or unconsciously he has chanted the holy name of Hari, therefore he is now free."

Now, we have to note this important thing, that the powerful //hari-nāma// is so strong that even one unconsciously or conscious... Sometimes they imitate: "Hare Kṛṣṇa." They have no intention to chant the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, but they imitate or criticize, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." That has also effect. That has also effect. Just like the Muhammadans during Caitanya Mahāprabhu's time, they sometimes used to criticize, "These Hindus are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa." So they were imitating. So gradually they also became devotees. //Yad vyājahāra vivaśo nāma svasty-ayanaṁ hareḥ. Vivaśi 'pi harer nāma vyājahāra uccaritavan na kevalam prāyaścitta. Mātram harer nāma api tu svasty-ayanaṁ makara-sādhanam api.[?]// So Śrīdhara Svāmī says that "This chanting of holy name of Nārāyaṇa, Hari, is not only counteracting his all sinful reactions, but he is now eligible to become liberated and being transferred to the spiritual world. Not only he has been freed from, but there is a reward for it." You see? //Eka hari-nāme yata pāpa hare, pāpī haya tata pāpa karibāre nare.[?]// A sinful man is very expert in committing sinful activities, but here is a statement that the holy name of Hari is so powerful that even an expert criminal cannot commit as much sinful activity as by once chanting the holy name of Hari, it can be counteracted. He is unable. The expert criminal is very advanced in committing sinful life, but //śāstra// says that he cannot commit so many sinful life. The one chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra is so powerful.

So one may be not bewildered. They may criticize that it's too much, but it is not too much. It is actual fact. Actual fact. That is //aparādha.// One who thinks like that, that //hari-nāma// has not so much power that it can counteract, they are offender. For them it is not possible. But one who believes in the words of the //śāstras,// as it is stated here, for him it is actually effective. //Artha-vāda.// Out of ten offenses, //artha-vāda,// one who comments like that, that is //artha-vāda,// and that is offense. So those who are cultivating this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// they should have firm faith in the statement of the //śāstras// that chanting of //harer nāma// is so powerful.

Now, it clearly says that //catur-akṣaram,// these four alphabet---//nā, rā, ya, ṇa//---four, //nā, rā, ya, ṇa,// that "Because he has uttered these four alphabets, Nārāyaṇa..." But he had no offense in chanting. He sincerely chanted offenseless chanting; therefore he became free immediately.

[commentary:] //Nanu karma syād guṇakaram harer nāmeti yuktam, yasya smṛtya ca nāmoktvā tapo-yajña-kriyādiṣu nūnaṁ taṁ pūrṇakaṁ yati sadyaḥ vande acyutam ity ādi-vacanam.[?]// So Śrīdhara Svāmī is quoting from //śāstras// that //baddha parikaratvena mokṣaya gamanam pratiti smṛte, na kevalaṁ prāyaścittaṁ harer nāma api tu satyayana...//[?] [etc.] This is a quotation from //smṛti-śāstra,// that //sakṛd uccaritaṁ yena hariti akṣara-dvayam.// If anyone simply chants these two alphabets, //ha, ri-hari//---then //baddha-parikaras tena mokṣaya gamanaṁ pratiti:// "Although he is a conditioned soul, his path for liberation is open." //Yasya smṛtya ca nāmoktvā tapa-yajña-kriyādiṣu, nūnaṁ taṁ pūrṇakaṁ yati sadyaḥ vande acyutam ity ādi-vacanam.[?]// There is another quotation, that //yasya smṛtya ca moktva tapo-yajña-kriyādiṣu.// These are pious activities: austerity and sacrifice, //tapas, yajña,// and //kriyā,// pious activities. Everything is done simply by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// There is no need of doing anything. Simply by chanting, one can achieve the result of //japa, yajña,// and other ritualistic performances prescribed in the Vedas. And this is specially advised to the //karma-kāṇḍīyas,// those who are very much fond of performing ritualistic ceremony. For them this instruction is specially meant, that if you chant simply Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// without any offense, then you'll get all the results of //japa, yajña,// and other ritualistic performances.

//Sakamtvena tapta-nivantakaṁ harer nāma katham syat tatrahuḥ etenaiva iti agho 'nya anyāyataḥ maghavat śabda...//[?] This light is not sufficient. [end]
