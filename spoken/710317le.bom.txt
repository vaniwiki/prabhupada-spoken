====== Lecture on Teachings of Lord Caitanya ======

**Prabhupāda:**
There are many //sat-saṅga// society, but in Europe and America, western countries, this is the only, and they have very kindly joined us. So to serve them is our first business. So, we are talking of teachings of Lord Caitanya to Sanātana //Gosvāmī.// Sanātana //Gosvāmī,// he was one of the very responsible minister in the [indistinct] government of Bengal. And as minister, he was a learned scholar both in Sanskrit and Arabic. So, he resigned his post as minister and wanted to join Lord Caitanya in his //saṅkīrtana// movement. He had some difficulties to get out of the responsible position. The Nawab, Hussain Shah was very much counting upon his assistance. Generally the Muhammadan kings, they were dependent on Hindu ministers. I have heard that in your this Bombay city, Aga Khan [?], his establishment for management were all Hindu officers. I do not know whether it is a fact. Is it a fact?

**Devotee:**
It's a fact.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They know that the Hindus can manage very intelligently. They're not extravagant. So, Sanātana //Gosvāmī// was favored by Lord Caitanya by instructing him for two months. He created two, three lieutenants for preaching His cult. One of them was Rūpa //Gosvāmī,// one of them was Sanātana //Gosvāmī,// the chief of the //Gosvāmīs.// And He talked with also Rāmānanda Raya, another stalwart. He was also statesman, he was governor of Madras on behalf of the then king of Orissa, Mahārāja Pratāparudra. He was very powerful king. The Muhammadans, the Pathans, they practically conquered all over India, but they could not enter Orissa. He was very strong king and in those days Madras was under the Orissa government. So, another responsible officer.... [aside:] Stop this. How it is happening? You can close these doors. So, he was another big officer, governor, he also joined Caitanya //Mahāprabhu.// And these two brothers, Rūpa //Gosvāmī// and Sanātana //Gosvāmī,// they were ministers in the government of Hussain Shah, they also joined. And Raghunātha dasa //Gosvāmī// he was also a big //zamindar,// landlord, so he also joined. And a big scholar, he also from Madras side, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa //Gosvāmī.// And Jīva //Gosvāmī,// he was also a very big scholar. He happened to be from Bengal. In this way Six //Gosvāmīs,// they were immediate disciples of Lord Caitanya and Lord Caitanya's instruction to them..., directly gave instruction to Rūpa //Gosvāmī// and Sanātana //Gosvāmī// and Rāmānanda Raya. So one of the //Gosvāmīs,// Sanātana //Gosvāmī,// the Caitanya //Mahāprabhu// is instructing at Benares. So his proposition was that some people, my neighborhood people or my dependents, government officers, they call me as a learned scholar, //paṇḍita.//

Of course, it is a system in India that a //brāhmaṇa// is addressed as a //paṇḍita// because he is supposed to become a learned scholar. //Brāhmaṇa's// business is to study Vedic literatures and teach others also //paṭhan pāṭhan.// He must be scholar and he must make others also scholar. Not that he is simply remains a scholar, no, that is bad. //Brāhmaṇa// is so liberal that he wants to make others also scholar. //Paṭhana, pāṭhana, yajana, yājana. Yajan// means worshiping the lord and //yājan// means helping others. Priest, you know, priestly business. Priest means he helps the householders how to become //Kṛṣṇa// conscious. //Purohita. Purohita// means one who does welfare activities for the householders. //Purohita. Yajana yājana, Paṭhana pāṭhana,// and //dāna pratigraha. Brāhmaṇa// business is to take charity from his disciples, followers, and again spend it for //Kṛṣṇa//'s service. So, these six kinds of business is for the //Brāhmaṇas// and they are suppose to be very learned, //paṇḍitajī. Brāhmaṇa's// position is //paṇḍita,// so he was called //paṇḍita.// And he was actually //paṇḍita// but he presented himself as a fool although he was learned. He presented himself, "My dear Lord, people say that I am very learned but actually I do not know what I am, where from I have come, why I am suffering."

First of all, we do not know that we are suffering in every step. Why we are using this fan? Because we are suffering. Because the excessive heat we cannot tolerate, suffering. Similarly, in the winter season this wind will be another suffering. We have closed the doors tightly so that air may not come. Now the air is counteracting suffering and in another season the same air will be suffering. So, the air is the cause of suffering and it is the so-called cause of happiness also. Actually we are simply suffering, that we do not know. But we get information from Lord //Kṛṣṇa// that this place is //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. It is a place for miseries. You cannot expect any happiness. That is our foolishness. That is our foolishness. We are trying to adjust things to become happy, but we are so foolish that we do not know there cannot be any happiness. This is called ignorance. This is called ignorance. Therefore //Bhāgavata// says //parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāta. Abodha-jāta,// every one of us born foolish. And we are acting in different ways to become happy, but we do not know that every step we are being defeated. We are fighting with the stringent laws of nature, struggle, but we are happy by some complacent thoughts that we have become happy, we are advanced. We are happy. We are becoming educated, we are advanced in science. But //Bhāgavata// says, "No, you are not advancing, you are simply being defeated, because you do not know how to get happiness. You are not trying for real happiness."

So, this ignorance is dissipated by the knowledge of the //Vedas.// Lord Caitanya therefore, has said, that //Kṛṣṇa// he will say, that because we are so foolish we have forgotten how to become happy, therefore //Kṛṣṇa// has made so many Vedic literatures. //Ataeva kṛṣṇa veda purāṇa korila.// So you should take advantage of these //Vedas.// Caitanya //Mahāprabhu// therefore says---we have already talked now---He says, //sādhu-śāstra-kṛpāya yadi kṛṣṇonmukha haya.// This is Bengali---I think you will understand---I will explain in English also. So, Caitanya //Mahāprabhu//'s proposal is: by the mercy of //sādhu,// holy man, or saintly person, or devotee... Who is a //sādhu?// We know this term //sādhu. Sādhu// means saintly person. But actually there are different kinds of //sādhus.// Generally people accept a //sādhu// when he is dressed with the saffron garment, but there are different types of //sādhus, mahātmā.// Some of them may be //jñānīs// who wants to merge into the Brahman effulgence. And another //sādhu// may be yogis, those who are trying to---the same ambition---to merge into the supreme by finding out in the heart. //Yoginaḥ, paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ. Dhyānāvasthita-manasā,// by meditation, meditative mind, //dhyānāvasthita-manasā dhiyāṁ paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ. Yoginaḥ,// they are trying to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead by meditative mind. That is yogi, and he is also //sādhu.// And //bhaktas.// Just like we have taken the path of devotional service to serve //Kṛṣṇa// at any cost. We don't think anything greater than the service of the Lord. That is the //bhakta's// position. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]], that is //bhakti.// Simply to serve //Kṛṣṇa// favorably. //Kṛṣṇa// conscious, always thinking of //Kṛṣṇa,// how He will be satisfied. Not thinking of //Kṛṣṇa,// how I shall kill Him. That is Kaṁsa's //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness. Kaṁsa was always thinking of //Kṛṣṇa,// but his business was to make plan how to kill //Kṛṣṇa.// Not that sort of //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness. Our //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness is //ānukūlyena,// favorable, how //Kṛṣṇa// will be satisfied. Although Kaṁsa's //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness helped him---he got liberation. //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness is so nice that if you become //Kṛṣṇa// conscious unfavorably, still you get the immediate profit being liberated. For which the //jñānīs// and //yogīs,// they are trying hundreds of years. //Kṛṣṇa// is so nice that if you simply think that, "I shall kill //Kṛṣṇa,// I shall kill //Kṛṣṇa.//"

There is a story in the //Bhaktamarg grantha// that one //paṇḍita// was reciting //Bhāgavata// and he was describing Śyāmasundara. Mother Yaśodā was decorating with all jewels very nicely to go with his cowherd boy friends, with the calves and cows. Śyāmasundara. And in the forest of //Vṛndāvana.// So, one thief was also hearing that //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So he thought it wise, "Why not go to //Vṛndāvana// and get all these ornaments from these boys? [laughter] They are all boys, so either I can kill them or somehow or other cheat them, get these ornaments." So, that's a long story [indistinct]. So, with that spirit he went to //Vṛndāvana// to find out Śyāmasundara to exploit Him, to take all the ornaments from Him. When he actually went to //Vṛndāvana,// he was finding out, "Where is Śyāmasundara? Where is Śyāmasundara?" Śyāmasundara came and, "Here I am." So, first of all he was [indistinct], "My dear boy, You give me all these ornaments I will give you nice thing." He said, "No, I cannot give you, my mother will be angry, no." [laughter] In this way then he decided that I shall take forcibly. In this way simply by the association of Śyāmasundara he became a devotee. That is the fact. Dhruva Mahārāja also went to worship Śyāmasundara, //Kṛṣṇa,// to get the kingdom of his father. He was insulted by his stepmother that, "You cannot sit down on the throne, or on the lap of your father, because you are not born from my womb." So he took it very seriously. He went to his mother, "My stepmother insulted me like this." So, his mother said, "My dear boy, yes, it is a fact because you are not born from my..." What it is called co-wifes?

**Devotee:**
Co-wife.

**Prabhupāda:**
".... womb. I'm unfortunate, you are born of my womb. So, so you cannot." Then, "I must have." The boy was very insistent, //kṣatriya// boy. "Then //Kṛṣṇa// helps you, then you can. Otherwise how, you cannot." Then he went to search out //Kṛṣṇa// in the jungle and he searched out. When he saw //Kṛṣṇa// he said, //svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]], no more I want it, no more I want it." This is the process. So, pure //bhakti// is without any desire, but even if you are filled up with desires, you go to //Kṛṣṇa.// Don't go to other demigods.

> mokṣa kāma udāra dhīḥ
> tivreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta puruṣaṁ param
> [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]

Even if you have desires, not that //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11], without any material desires. Generally we go to temple, to God, for some, for fulfilling some material desires. So, //śāstra// says even if you have got material desires, even if you are not //śuddha bhakta...// What to speak of //śuddha bhakta,// even if you are an enemy of //Kṛṣṇa,// somehow or other go to //Kṛṣṇa.// Go to the fire and you'll get warm. That is our propaganda. The //Gosvāmīs// recommend therefore, //yena tena prakāreṇa manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet.// Somehow or other you just try to become //Kṛṣṇa// conscious, then everything will be successful. That is our propaganda. Therefore Caitanya //Mahāprabhu// says, //sādhu, śāstra, kṛpāya.// A //sādhu// means devotee. That I was going to explain. A //sādhu,// there are different kinds of //sādhus,// but only the devotee, he is //sādhu.// It is explained by //Kṛṣṇa// himself, //api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. He is //sādhu.// Even if you find some defects in him due to his former habits, but he is simply engaged in //Kṛṣṇa//'s service, unflinching devotion, he is //sādhu.// He is //sādhu.// In spite of some defects. We must admit, even in fire there are some defects. Fire is so pure that anything impure you put into the fire, it becomes pure. Perhaps you know in our Hindu system if a one utensil becomes impure some time, you put it in the fire and it becomes pure. Is it not? Is it not?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Bengal this is the system.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, fire is considered to be pure. Therefore any ceremony is done before fire-god. So, //Kṛṣṇa// says that even fire is so pure, still there are some defect, there is smoke. So, if you want to find out defect, you'll find out in fire also. But that doesn't matter, fire is fire. Similarly, a devotee, an unflinching devotee, without any other desires, who is dedicated to the service of the Lord, he is //sādhu.// So we have to take shelter of such //sādhu. Ādau gurv-āśrayam.// And //sādhu// will instruct you. Not by whims, but through //śāstra.// He is //sādhu. Sādhu// will never speak to you anything which is not in the //śāstra. Sādhu, śāstra,// and guru. And guru is bona fide spiritual master who follows //sādhu// and //śāstra.// Who follows his bona fide spiritual master and who follows the instructions of //śāstra,// he is guru. //sādhu-śāstra-guru-vākya, tinete kariyā aikya.// Narottama dasa //Ṭhākura// says that you have to act by accommodating the instruction of //sādhu,// instruction of //śāstra.// And you have to distribute. Because Caitanya //Mahāprabhu// says that these ignorant people who are being defeated repeatedly, such persons, they are being entangled in this materialistic way of life, in this material world. //Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva.// He said, //kṛṣṇa bhuli' sei jīva anādi-bahirmukha// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]]. Anyone who has forgotten //Kṛṣṇa,// he is //anādi bahir mukha.// He is enamored by this external energy, material world. Just like in Bombay city everyone is working hard, very hard. Their mission is, "How I shall be able to construct a skyscraper building." That's all. Why they are working so hard? Their mission is that I must have a skyscraper house and good apartment and nice wife, nice children and bank balance, then happy. [chuckles] But he does not know how long these things will continue. Ten years, twenty years, fifty years, hundred years, then finished. Your skyscraper building, your nice wife, your apartment, your friends, everything that you have made[?], you do not know where you are going. That you do not know. There is risk. //Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran loke tyajaty// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]], at the time of death everything will be examined. What are you going to be next? You have to accept another body. So that body will be created in this life. //Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi// and that bodily structure will be formed at the time of your death. Just like if you leave this apartment, you'll have to go another apartment. So you have to select another apartment, good or bad. That will depend on your capacity, how much rent you are able to pay. Then you leave this apartment. Similarly, at the time of death by the superior arrangement, another apartment will be given to you, and immediately that is settled up, you leave this body and enter into that body. //Daiva-netreṇa, karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. That will be considered by your work. If your works are nice... That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā
> yānti mad-yājino 'pi mām
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

So if you have prepared your life for going to the higher planetary systems, in the moon planet or sun planet or..., there are so many hundreds and thousands and millions of planets up, and similarly down, and similarly in the middle. //Catur// [indistinct], fourteen worlds. So, //ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā// [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]. If you have developed //sattva-guṇa// then you will be allowed to go to the upper planets.

> ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā
> madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ
> jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā
> adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ
> [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]

So, we have to see from the //śāstras,// therefore //śāstras.// So this is the position. Caitanya //Mahāprabhu// explains that sometimes you are elevated to the //svarga-loka,// sometimes you are going to the //naraka-loka.// In this way it is going on, but this is not our good business. Now, suppose I am in this good apartment, say for six months, and next if I cannot pay the rent, I have no means, then I go, what is called? Jopri? [?] Eh? There are jopris [?] also in Bombay. So, not that because one is in Bombay, he is always in the skyscraper. He may be in jopri [?] also. So, everyone wants. So this is going on, [indistinct] //narake.// Sometimes in the heavenly planet, sometimes in the hellish planet, this is going on, but this business is not good. //Na sādhu manye.// Even if you get the body of the heavenly planet, what you get? There is also //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. You have to die there. Even Brahma dies. //Ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]. So this is the process going on. Therefore Caitanya //Mahāprabhu// says, //sādhu-śāstra-kṛpāya yadi kṛṣṇonmukha.// Our only business is how to become //Kṛṣṇa// conscious, how to become //Kṛṣṇa// conscious. That can be done simply by the mercy of //sādhu.// Therefore //sādhus'// business is, "Go from door to door and enlighten them." //Mahad-vicalanaṁ nṝṇāṁ gṛhiṇāṁ dīna-cetasām.// The //sādhu's// business is that he goes from door to door and tries to invoke //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness, dormant //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness. In everyone's heart there is //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness. It is in a sleeping state. Just like these European and American boys, unless there was //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness dormant, how it could be invoked? It is not sentiment. It was there. Our business was to, just to arouse. //Śravaṇādi-śuddha-citta koro ei udaya.//

> nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti sadhu kabhu naya
> śravaṇādi-śuddha-citta karaye udaya

This is the statement of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// The //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness is already there but by hearing and purifying yourself, that consciousness comes. Just like water. Water is very clean. When it rains from the clouds it is very clean, but as soon as it drops on the ground it becomes muddy. So that muddiness has to be cleansed then water will come out again clean. Similarly, our consciousness is clean, //Kṛṣṇa// conscious, actually, originally, but because it is contaminated with the muddy things of the material nature, it is cloudy. So, this process---Hare //Kṛṣṇa,// Hare //Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa,// Hare Hare---is the cleaning, clarifying process, of the consciousness. Clarifying process. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. If you take to this clarifying process, then it will be just like as clear as mirror and you will be able to see your face nicely, what I am. Then you'll understand that I don't belong to this material world, I belong to the spiritual world, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi;// and when you realize that, then if you can act yourself as Brahman, then your life is successful.

> brahma-bhutaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

That is beginning of devotional service. So //Kṛṣṇa,// Caitanya //Mahāprabhu, sādhu-śāstra-kṛpāya yadi kṛṣṇonmukha haya sei jīva nistare. Nistare// means he becomes delivered. If somehow or other he becomes //Kṛṣṇa// conscious, by the mercy of a //sādhu,// and by understanding the //śāstra,// if somehow or other he becomes lean to //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness, then he is eligible for being delivered from this miserable condition of material life. //Māyā tāhāre chāḍaya.// Then this illusion, //māyā,// releases our light here now. That is also stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī
> mama māyā duratyayā
> mām eva ye prapadyante
> māyām etaṁ taranti te
> [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]

This simple process that you surrender to //Kṛṣṇa// and //māyā// immediately gives you release, "Oh, no more. That's all right." [pause] Yes, any questions? So, this //Kṛṣṇa// consciousness movement is very scientific, authorized and practical, and very simple. You all take to this and be happy. That is our program. If you have got any question, you can ask. [pause] We shall hold class here in the morning at about half past five, six and in the evening at seven, after seven. Any questions? [pause] Then have //kīrtana.// [end]
