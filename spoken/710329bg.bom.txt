====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.3 ======

**Haṁsadūta:**
The following was a wedding and initiation at the Cross Maidan, evening of 29th March, 1971.

**Prabhupāda:**
//...yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa bāhyābhyantara-śuciḥ śrī-viṣṇu śrī-viṣṇu śrī-viṣṇu.// By chanting the holy name of Lord Viṣṇu, one becomes purified in whatever condition he may be. //Apavitraḥ pavitro vā,// either he is pure or impure, //sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā,// any condition of life, if he chants the holy name of Viṣṇu, then he becomes immediately purified internally and externally. [break]

...on the strength of chanting. This is the greatest offense. It is a fact that when one chants this //mantra,// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, immediately, his past sinful reaction of life immediately ceases. But if he thinks that "Because by chanting my sinful reactions are counteracted, therefore I may go on committing sinful activities, at the same time chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,//" this is called //nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.// One who is continuing sinful activities on the strength of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// that is the greatest offense. So out of the ten kinds of offenses, as explained by Subala Mahārāja, this is the most important item. One should not commit any sinful activity because he is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Go on. Next. [break]

...Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakācārya Aṣṭottara-śata Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Mahārāja Prabhupāda. He was creating more //brahmacārīs// and //sannyāsīs// for preaching work, but I am creating more //gṛhasthas// [applause], because in Europe and America the boys and girls intermingle so quickly and intimately that it is very difficult to keep one //brahmacārī.// So there is no need of artificial //brahmacārīs.// It is sanctioned. My Guru Mahārāja wanted to establish //daiva-varṇāśrama.// So married life is called //gṛhastha-āśrama.// It is as good as //sannyāsa-āśrama. Āśrama// means where there is //bhagavad-bhajana.// It doesn't matter whether one is //sannyāsī// or one is //gṛhastha// or a //brahmacārī.// The main principle is //bhagavad-bhajana.// But practically also, I may inform you that these married couples, they are helping me very much because... For practical example I may say that one of my Godbrothers, a //sannyāsī,// he was deputed to go to London for starting a temple, but three or four years he remained there, he could not execute the will; therefore he was called back. Now, I sent six married couples. All of them are present here. And they worked so nicely that within one year we started our London temple, and that is going on very nicely. [applause]

So it is not the question of a //brahmacārī, sannyāsī// or //gṛhastha.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,

> kibā vipra kibā nyāsī śūdra kene naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]

It doesn't matter whether he is a //sannyāsī// or //gṛhastha// or //brahmacārī.// One who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa and preaches all over the world, he is guru, spiritual master. It doesn't matter. So in Europe and America I am especially creating more //gṛhasthas,// families, so that they can take up this movement very seriously and preach, and I am glad to inform you that this process has become very successful. Thank you very much. [applause]

> om ajñāna-timirāndhasya jñānāñjana-śalākayā

**[I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, who with the torchlight of knowledge has opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance.]**

> śrī-caitanya-mano-'bhīṣṭaṁ sthāpitaṁ yena bhū-tale
> svayaṁ rūpaḥ kadā mahyaṁ dadāti sva-padāntikam

**[When will Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, who has established within this material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?]**

> śrī-rādhā-kṛṣṇa-pādān saha-gaṇa-lalitā-śrī-viśākhānvitāṁś ca

**[I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master and of all the other preceptors on the path of devotional service. I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiṣṇavas and unto the Six Gosvāmīs, including Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, Jīva Gosvāmī and their associates. I offer my respectful obeisances unto Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and all His devotees, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura. I then offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and all the gopīs, headed by Lalitā and Viśākhā.]**

> he kṛṣṇa karuṇā-sindho dīna-bandho jagat-pate
> gopeśa gopikā-kānta rādhā-kānta namo 'stu te

**[O my dear Kṛṣṇa, ocean of mercy, You are the friend of the distressed and the source of creation. You are the master of the cowherd men and the lover of the //gopīs,// especially Rādhārāṇī. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.]**

> vṛṣabhānu-sute devi praṇamāmi hari-priye

That's all right. Anyone? [break]

//...Gītā// Lord Kṛṣṇa says who can understand Him. By understanding Kṛṣṇa as it is stated in the Fourth Chapter---//janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ//---simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa, one becomes so much elevated that after quitting this body, material body, //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]], he never accepts again this material body. As I have already explained to you that our miserable conditioned life is this---that we have to accept every fifty years or sixty or utmost hundred years, we have to accept another body. We may make very good arrangement in this life, nice bungalow, good bank balance, nice family relationships, everything. But the thing is that we shall not be allowed to stay. //Aśāśvatam. Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. Therefore all our attempts to become very happy within this material world is futile. The intelligent man should know this, that "I want permanent settlement in my life, but that is not being done." Only intelligent man can understand because intelligent means to understand that we are all eternal. Why should we accept this temporary body? We must have our eternal body. That is possible. You can have your eternal body like Kṛṣṇa. At the present moment, although we are eternal, we have to accept a certain type of body which is not eternal. //Asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. //Asann api.// This body is temporary, but it is very miserable. It is always giving us trouble. That we should know. //Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]].

So in the human society there must be some program how to cultivate such knowledge which can give me relief from this repeated birth and death. That is perfect human society. Otherwise those who are being carried away by the waves of material nature like cats and dogs, that is not proper human society. Human society means which society is making advance in spiritual knowledge, the Aryans. The Aryans means those who are advanced in spiritual knowledge. They are called Aryans. //Ārya.// Kṛṣṇa says, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. There are 400,000 species of human beings, different types of human beings. //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. There are so many varieties, they are considered lowest, low-grade. They cannot realize what is the aim of life. //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ. Kirāta,// the black race. Sometimes it is interpreted: the Africans or the south part of our country. //Kirāta.// Huns. These Huns are supposed to be inhabitants of the northern region of Russia. Some of them migrated into Germany. //Kirāta, hūṇa, āndhra, pulinda, pulkaśa.// There are so many different names. Of course, if we research from history, from the world history, we can find out where there are. But there are varieties of human beings. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. All human beings are not of the same standard. There are different standards. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind, Kṛṣṇa is so powerful, that anyone out of this human society can be claimed to become a Vaiṣṇava. Anyone. That is the statement of Śukadeva Gosvāmī. //Kirāta-huṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ, ye 'nye ca pāpāḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. These names are mentioned, but there are many others whose names are not mentioned. //Ye 'nye ca pāpāḥ.// They are called //pāpāḥ. Pāpa// means very sinful life. //Yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ.// If such persons, such lower-grade persons even, they take shelter of a pure devotee, then they become purified. //Śudhyanti,// they become purified. How? //Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// That is the special prerogative power of Lord Viṣṇu. He can deliver anyone in any condition of life. //Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// That is extra, extraordinary, inconceivable power.

According to //smārta-vidhi,// unless one changes his body, he cannot be purified. That impression is going on in India, that unless one is born in Hindu family or born in //brāhmaṇa// family, //kṣatriya,// he cannot be accepted as //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// like that. But according to Vedic literature, that is not sanctioned. It is... To become a son of //brāhmaṇa// and to have the privilege of becoming a //brāhmaṇa,// certainly there is. Just like a boy born in a medical man's family, so he has got a chance, better chance, to become a medical man. Similarly, a boy born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, he has got better chance to become a //brāhmaṇa.// Or a boy born in //kṣatriya// family or //vaiśya// family, he has got better chance. But that does not mean simply by taking birth in a //brāhmaṇa// family or //kṣatriya// family, one becomes //kṣatriya// or //brāhmaṇa.// No. He has to acquire the qualities. That is stated in //Bhagavad-gītā. Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. And the qualification of //brāhmaṇa// is also stated there: //satyaṁ śamaḥ damaḥ śaucaṁ titikṣā ārjavam āstikyam, jñānaṁ vijñānaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam.// These are the characteristics of //brāhmaṇa.// Similarly, there are characteristics of //kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.//

So in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is not stated... At least... We are discussing //Bhagavad-gītā.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// at least, there is no such statement that a man becomes //brāhmaṇa// simply being born in a //brāhmaṇa// family or a man becomes //śūdra// simply by becoming born in a //śūdra// family. //Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.// This is also confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Śrī Nārada Muni instructs Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira:

> yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ
> puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam
> yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta
> tat tenaiva vinirdiśet
> [[books:sb:7:11:35|[SB 7.11.35]]]

Nārada Muni said that if the symptoms or characteristics of a certain status of social order is found in other family... For example, if a //śūdra-//born boy is inclined to accept brahmanism or Vedic culture, he should be given the chance. That is accepted in the //Pāñcarātriki-vidhi.// Just like these boys, European and American boys and girls, they are, according to our //śāstra,// they are less than //śūdras,// or you can call them //caṇḍālas.// But they are being elevated to the status of the //brāhmaṇa// qualities by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness process. It doesn't matter.

Our Sanātana Gosvāmī gives direction in the //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa// that one man can become a //brāhmaṇa// by the regular process of //dīkṣā. Dīkṣā,// this initiation, cannot be offered to a //śūdra. Dīkṣā// cannot be offered to a //śūdra.// But in this age, Kali-yuga, it is the statement of the //śāstras// that in the Kali-yuga most of the population are //śūdras. Kalau śūdrā sambhavāḥ.// How they can be initiated? This initiation is offered not according to the Vedic rules, because it is very difficult to find out a qualified //brāhmaṇa. Dīkṣā// is offered to a qualified //brāhmaṇa.// Therefore this //dīkṣā// is offered according to //Pāñcarātriki-vidhi.// That is recommended in this age. My spiritual master inaugurated this //Pāñcarātriki-vidhi,// and we are following his footsteps. Anyone who is inclined to devote his life for Kṛṣṇa, he should be accepted as //brāhmaṇa.//

Of course, he should be trained up. Not that these boys and girls are being initiated all of a sudden. They are trained up for six months, one year, then they are offered //hari-nāma.// And when they are qualified actually in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// at least sixteen rounds daily, when we see, one year at least, that he is doing his duties, following the regulative principles... All these boys and girls who are initiated, they will have to follow the regulative principles. No illicit sex life. Just like one couple is married because we don't allow to live..., to allow the boys and girls to live as friends. No. That is not allowed. All my students who came to me... Because it has become a system in their country, the young boys and girls they live as friends without parents taking care of their being married. That has become a system, regular system in Europe and America. And India also it is going to be introduced very soon. It is already introduced, and it will develop. And in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there is foretelling that in this age there will be no more marriage. Vedic marriage will be stopped. //Svīkāra eva ca udvāhe.// Simply by agreement, the marriage function will be performed. But as far as we are concerned, we are trying to establish //daiva-varṇāśrama,// as it is instructed by the Gosvāmīs, by //Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,// by our spiritual master. May not be very perfect, but we are trying our best to introduce this //daiva-varṇāśrama.//

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says... //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]], ...means not ordinary men. Those who are situated in this //daiva-varṇāśrama,// qualified //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra...// And we should note also that this division of //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,// and //śūdra,// is not that to make artificial competition and to become puffed-up with pride that "I am //brāhmaṇa.// You are //śūdra.//" No. It is a cooperation. Just like you have got cooperative society, similarly, these four divisions of social orders are cooperative society. The //brāhmaṇa// is considered to be the mouth of the social body. The //kṣatriya// is considered to be the army---arm or army, strength of the social body. The //vaiśyas// are considered to be the productive element of the body. And the //śūdras// are considered to be the working class. But the intelligent class, the //brāhmaṇas,// and the administrative class, the //kṣatriyas,// and the productive class, the //vaiśyas,// and the working class, the //śūdras,// they are equally important. If you take the whole body, you cannot say that the leg is unimportant than the head. Head is as important as the legs. But comparatively, because the head, the brain, gives direction, therefore it is more important as the legs. But comparatively, because the head, the brain, gives direction, therefore it is more important than the legs. But without leg, the brain also cannot work. Without hand, the brain also cannot work, simply by brain. Brain is of course most important. Similarly, in the social order, the //brāhmaṇas,// the intelligent class of men, are very important undoubtedly, but //śūdras// are not less important. They are also important. That is the system given by the Lord Himself.

//Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. To cooperate, to understand... It is also compared that the //brāhmaṇa// is the head of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the //virāṭ-puruṣa.// So //brāhmaṇa's// business is, because it is the head, to give direction to the society, to the spiritual society, //daiva-varṇāśrama,// how to conduct the life and occupation of the society. That is //brāhmaṇa's// business. The //kṣatriya's// business is to give protection to the society. And the //vaiśya's// business is to give food, productive. //Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. In this way there is a cooperative system, taking as part and parcel of the supreme body. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. So we should cooperate, but there must be these four classes of men. Not that simply //śūdras// and //vaiśyas.// At the present moment, there are few //vaiśyas// and mostly //śūdras. Rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. //Rajas-tamaḥ,// by the //rajo-guṇa,// the //kṣatriyas// are produced, and by //tamo-guṇa// the //śūdras// are produced. And //vaiśyas// are mixed up //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// So it doesn't matter in whatever //guṇa// or status of life we are. If all of us take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then our life is successful, mutual cooperation. So therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]].

Now, how to make perfect, perfection of life, //siddhi?// That is stated in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Anādi-bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli' gelā, ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa kailā// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]].[?] Because we have all forgotten Kṛṣṇa, that is our miserable condition of life. We are all forgotten about Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is teaching us personally. Five thousand years ago, He personally appeared and teaching us, we forgetful of Kṛṣṇa, the whole human society. Kṛṣṇa is teaching everyone. Don't think that Kṛṣṇa is teaching only in India and to the //brāhmaṇas// or the Hindus. Kṛṣṇa is for everyone. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is being accepted by everyone all over the world. It is our duty. Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore says it is the duty of all Indians to spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement for //para-upakāra,// all over the world. That is our business. So //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. The //siddhi// means when one takes to the //daiva-varṇāśrama// principles. That is stated in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa,//

> varṇāśramācāravatā
> puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān
> viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā
> nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]

The whole life should be engaged how to satisfy Viṣṇu or Kṛṣṇa. That is //varṇāśrama-dharma.// The four orders, social orders and spiritual orders---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// and //brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,// and //sannyāsa//---these orders are made for Kṛṣṇa realization. These Vedic principles are there to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]].

So Kṛṣṇa says that out of many thousands of human beings, species of 400,000's of species... //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. They come to the principle of this Vedic system of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// That is the process of //siddhi.// Without coming to this process of //varṇa// and //āśrama, cātur-varṇyam,// the human life is animal life, or less than animal life. That is not accepted as human society. Therefore it is necessary that all over the world this //varṇāśrama-dharma,// according to //Bhagavad-gītā,// must be established. I am therefore trying to get these boys and girls married. This is the system of //varṇāśrama-dharma.// And they are happy. These boys and girls who are married... Of course, there are //sannyāsīs// and //brahmacārīs.// My open order is... I get... I receive so many letters daily that "I wish to marry." Immediately I sanction, "Yes, you get yourself married." But one who is strict, one who can follow very rigidly the orders of //brahmacārī// and //sannyāsī,// they continue. Therefore you will find in our society there are //sannyāsīs,// there are //brahmacārīs,// there are //gṛhasthas,// there are //vānaprasthas,// like that. So no one is checked or hindered to make progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone is welcome.

So //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. //Siddhaye// means to enter into the institution of //daiva-varṇa// and //āśrama.// That is called //siddhi.// Otherwise animals. And //yatatām api siddhānām// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. Those who are engaged in the four orders or //varṇa// and //āśrama,// out of them, //yatatām api siddhānām.// Those who are actually in the position of a //brāhmaṇa,// actually in the position of a //kṣatriya, siddhānām...// They are called //siddha.// Actually following the rules and regulation of //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,// they are called //siddha. Kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ.// It is not that one has become a //brāhmaṇa,// qualified //brāhmaṇa,// because one has become qualified //kṣatriya,// he will understand Kṛṣṇa. It is not easy to understand Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He is coming personally and He is leaving behind Him this //Bhagavad-gītā// to understand Him. That is Kṛṣṇa's kindness. Otherwise, by so-called mental speculation, you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. It is not possible. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. If a person is very expert in exercising his senses, mental speculator, it is not that he will understand Kṛṣṇa. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi. Nāmādi// means His holy name, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Because name is the first. In our, this forgetful condition, our first business is to chant the holy name. Therefore //nāmādi.// To understand Kṛṣṇa we have to chant His holy name first, //ādi.// Then gradually, Kṛṣṇa's qualities, Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, Kṛṣṇa's entourage and everything will be revealed.

> ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi
> na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ
> sevonmukhe hi jihvādau
> svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]

If we take to this devotional service, then this chanting, this vibration of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, very simple method, if we accept this... Just like we have offered these boys this chanting process, and they have accepted it very humbly. And if they prosecute the routine work, gradually they will understand what is Kṛṣṇa. As you see the advanced students who are dancing in ecstasy, you can understand how much they have understood Kṛṣṇa. A simple method. And nobody is checked or barred: "You are not Hindu. You cannot chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." No. //Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]. It doesn't matter whether he is a Hindu or Muslim or Christian or this or that. One has to learn the science of Kṛṣṇa, //Bhagavad-gītā,// as it is. Then he becomes a spiritual master.

These boys, this boy and girl just now married, I am sending to Australia. The boy has come from Australia, the girl has come from Sweden. Now they are united. Now they are going to maintain our establishment there in Sydney. Just now I am sending them within two or three days. They will take care of the temple and they will preach also. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is expanding by their help. I am alone, but they are helping me. They are my gurus. I am not their guru, [applause] because they are helping me in executing my Guru Mahārāja's order. So it is very nice combination that somebody is going to Australia, somebody is going to Fiji Island, somebody is going to Hong Kong, somebody is going to Czechoslovakia. And we are also negotiating to go to Russia also. There is chance of going to China also. We are attempting. We have already sent two boys to Pakistan---one in Dacca and one in Karachi. [applause]

So these boys, these American boys, are helping me. I am very sorry that no Indians are coming forward for this... Of course, there are some, but very few. They should come forward, younger generation of India, they should join this movement and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. That is Indian's business. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,

> bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This //para-upakāra// business, welfare activities to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world, is the most important business at the present moment. It will unite everyone politically, socially, culturally, religiously, in every way. Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the center. That's a fact. It is making progress. And if we endeavor more and more, it will make more and more progress.

So Kṛṣṇa says therefore:

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

Therefore one who has understood Kṛṣṇa by this process of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra, svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ,// Kṛṣṇa reveals to them. //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart. As soon as one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Kṛṣṇa helps him. If he comes forward one step, Kṛṣṇa comes forward ten steps. But if you do not want Kṛṣṇa, that is a different business. But one who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness...

These boys and girls, they are simply engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Twenty-four hours they are simply hearing about Kṛṣṇa. Twenty-four hours. Not that fifteen minutes' meditation and twenty-three hours doing all nonsense. It is twenty-four hours meditation. Even in sleeping, meditation, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//

So //ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. If we simply speculate, our senses, it is not possible to understand. But if we take to this process, //sevonmukhe hi jihvādau... Jihvā,// this tongue, can be engaged in two processes. You can glorify Lord Kṛṣṇa. Simply glorify Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is so great, Kṛṣṇa is so kind, Kṛṣṇa is so beautiful, Kṛṣṇa is so opulent, Kṛṣṇa is so powerful. Why you make Kṛṣṇa as imperson? He has got so many qualities, transcendental qualities. What would you gain simply by saying that Kṛṣṇa is //nirākāra,// finish all business? No. Try to understand Kṛṣṇa, how much powerful He is, how much strong He is, how beautiful he is, how learned, wise He is, and hear from Him. The //śāstras// are there. Why you stop your business of Kṛṣṇa consciousness simply by saying that Kṛṣṇa is //nirākāra?// Kṛṣṇa is not //nirākāra.// How He can be //nirākāra? Sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Vigraha// means He has got transcendental form. If He hasn't got transcendental form, how these great //ācāryas// are worshiping Him---Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Lord Caitanya, and all the great //ācāryas?// Does it mean they are making a farce?

Kṛṣṇa has got //ākāra.// Kṛṣṇa therefore says, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. //Avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannaṁ manyante mām abuddhayaḥ// [[books:bg:7:24|[Bg. 7.24]]]. Kṛṣṇa has got transcendental form. He has got His abode. He is engaged there always.

Every description is there in the Vedic literatures. Therefore if we learn about Kṛṣṇa, being situated in the //daiva-varṇāśrama// or having acquired the real qualities of //brāhmaṇa,// higher or transcendental qualities... //Brāhmaṇa// qualities means //brahma jānāti iti brāhmaṇaḥ.// That is //nirākāra,// of course, but you have to transcend the position of //brāhmaṇa// and become a Vaiṣṇava. Then you will understand the Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's qualities, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [Brs. 1.2.234]. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. Those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, those who are not advanced in Kṛṣṇa science, for them, Kṛṣṇa is covered by the //yoga-māyā// curtain.

Kṛṣṇa is Śyāmasundara, but one who has advanced his love of Kṛṣṇa, //premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti,// he can see Kṛṣṇa every moment, everywhere. Anyone can elevate himself to that stage of seeing Kṛṣṇa every moment by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

So we have to understand Kṛṣṇa //tattvataḥ,// in truth, by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
