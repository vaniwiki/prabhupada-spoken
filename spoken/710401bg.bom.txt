====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.7 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> om ajñāna-timirāndhasya jñānāñjana-śalākayā
> cakṣur unmīlitaṁ yena tasmai śrī-gurave-namaḥ

**[I offer my respectful obeisances unto my spiritual master, who with the torchlight of knowledge has opened my eyes, which were blinded by the darkness of ignorance.]**

> śrī-caitanya-mano-'bhīṣṭaṁ sthāpitaṁ yena bhū-tale
> svayaṁ rūpaḥ kadā mahyaṁ dadāti sva-padāntikam

**[When will Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, who has established within this material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?]**

> vande 'haṁ śrī-guroḥ śrī-yuta-pada-kamalaṁ śrī-gurūn vaiṣṇavāṁś ca

**[I offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of my spiritual master and of all the other preceptors on the path of devotional service. I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiṣṇavas and unto the Six Gosvāmīs, including Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, Śrīla Sanātana Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, Jīva Gosvāmī and their associates. I offer my respectful obeisances unto Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and all His devotees, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura. I then offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and all the gopīs, headed by Lalitā and Viśākhā.]**

> he kṛṣṇa karuṇā-sindho dīna-bandho jagat-pate
> gopeśa gopikā-kānta rādhā-kānta namo 'stu te

**[O my dear Kṛṣṇa, ocean of mercy, You are the friend of the distressed and the source of creation. You are the master of the cowherd men and the lover of the //gopīs,// especially Rādhārāṇī. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.]**

> tapta-kāñcana-gaurāṅgi rādhe vṛndāvaneśvari
> vṛṣabhānu-sute devi praṇamāmi hari-priye

**[I offer my respects to Rādhārāṇī, whose bodily complexion is like molten gold and who is the Queen of Vṛndāvana. You are the daughter of King Vṛṣabhānu, and You are very dear to Lord Kṛṣṇa.]**

> vāñchā-kalpatarubhyaś ca kṛpā-sindhubhya eva ca
> patitānāṁ pāvanebhyo vaiṣṇavebhyo namo namaḥ

**[I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiṣṇava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls.]**

> śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda
> śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda

**[I offer my obeisances to Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Prabhu Nityānanda, Śrī Advaita, Gadādhara, Śrīvāsa and all others in the line of devotion.]**

> hare kṛṣṇa hare kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa kṛṣṇa hare hare
> hare rāma hare rāma rāma rāma hare hare

**[My dear Lord, and the spiritual energy of the Lord, kindly engage me in Your service. I am now embarrassed with this material service. Please engage me in Your service.]**

Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for your coming here and participating with our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So Kṛṣṇa says,

> mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat
> kiñcid asti dhanañjaya
> mayi sarvam idaṁ protaṁ
> sūtre maṇi-gaṇā iva
> [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]

So Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere because everything is resting on Him, on His energies. Just like in a big factory the proprietor may be out of the factory, but every worker is aware that "This factory belongs to such-and-such person." As this is possible to have always a consciousness of the proprietor of the factory by the worker, similarly, it is possible for everyone to become Kṛṣṇa conscious in every activity. That is the philosophy we are trying to preach all over the world. The //Bhagavad-gītā// philosophy is like that. //Yudhyasva mām anusmara// [[books:bg:8:7|[Bg. 8.7]]]. You have to... This world is so made that one has to work. Without working, nobody can even maintain his body and soul together. That you cannot avoid. But at the same time, we can remember Kṛṣṇa. That is... That depends only on practice and understanding, pure understanding.

So here Kṛṣṇa says that "There is nobody greater than Me." That is the verdict of all ancient Vedic literatures. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// also, the same thing is confirmed, that //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. There is a list of different incarnations of God. In that list Lord Buddha's name is also there. Lord Buddha's name is described: //kīkaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati. Buddho nāmnāñjana-sutaḥ kīkaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati.// In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// the Lord Buddha's name is mentioned as future incarnation. //Bhaviṣyati,// "will appear." //Kīkaṭeṣu,// "in the province of Gayā."So this is called //śāstra.// Because //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// was composed five thousand years ago and Lord Buddha appeared 2,600 years ago... Therefore five thousand years ago Lord Buddha's case was in the future. Therefore it is said //bhaviṣyati,// "He will appear." This is called //śāstra. Trikāla-jña. Śāstra// writers, they are not ordinary men. Just like Kṛṣṇa is speaking. He is not ordinary man. Nobody will be interested so much if //Bhagavad-gītā// was written by ordinary man. It was spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and it was recorded by His incarnation, Vyāsadeva. So it is transcendental literature. Ordinary literatures, they cannot be perfect because there are four defect: //bhrama-pramāda-karaṇāpāṭava-vipralipsā. Bhrama// means "to commit mistake." //Pramāda// means "illusion," and //vipralipsā// means "cheating," and //karaṇāpāṭava,// "inefficiency of the senses." So //śāstra// means above these defects. Where there is no such defect, that is //śāstra.// And you can understand how five thousand years ago Lord Buddha's appearance was predicted. Similarly, still there is prediction about //kalki-avatāra,// which will take place about four //lakhs// and 27,000 years hereafter. //Kalki-avatāra's// name, his father's name and where he will appear, everything is there. This is called //śāstra.//

So we have to understand Kṛṣṇa from the //śāstra.// Kṛṣṇa Himself speaking that //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya:// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]] "There is nobody else greater than Me." And when Arjuna understood //Bhagavad-gītā,// he also accepted Kṛṣṇa like that. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān:// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]] "You are Para-brahman." So Kṛṣṇa is Para-brahman. Brahman, we are all Brahman because we are part and parcels of Para-brahman, but we are not Para-brahman. We are subordinate Brahman. //Eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.// We are supported by Kṛṣṇa. We are supported by God. He is one, God is one. And the supported Brahmans, or living entities, they are innumerable, beyond the numerical strength. //Asaṅkhya.// Nobody can count how many living entities are there, but God is one.

So from the ancient literature we understand that //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. There are many incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, expansion of Kṛṣṇa, //svāṁśa// and //vibhinnāṁśa.// Some of the expansions are direct personal expansions, just like Lord Rāma, Nṛsiṁha-deva, Varāha. There are many. //Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan// [Bs. 5.39]. Kṛṣṇa is existing, expanding Himself in various forms like Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, and so many others. There are different kinds of incarnations, //avatāras---śaktyāveśāvatāra, guṇāvatāra, manvantarāvatāra, yugāvatāra.// Many incarnations. And in the //Bhāgavata// it is concluded that the Lord's incarnations are so numerous that you cannot count. Just like if you sit down on the bank of a river, you cannot keep an account of the waves, how many waves are passing, similarly, there is no account how many incarnations are coming out from Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa is above all. Here Kṛṣṇa personally says, and it is confirmed by all the sages, authorities, formerly by great sages like Nārada Muni, Vyāsadeva, Asita, Devala, and in the modern age by all the //ācāryas:// Śaṅkarācārya, Madhvācārya Rāmānujācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī---so many other //ācāryas//---Lord Caitanya. Everyone accepts that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. How can you deny? We have to be guided by the //ācāryas. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.// One who follows the principles of //ācāryas,// he knows the things as they are. That is the verdict.

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// also, we find: //ācāryopāsanam.// We have to follow the footprints, footsteps, of the //ācāryas,// because they can give us right direction. And one who does not follow the //ācāryas// and creates and manufactures his mental concoction, his version will not be accepted. There are many different commentaries on the //Bhagavad-gītā,// but not all of them are according to the direction of the //ācāryas.// You have to accept //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is under the direction of the //ācāryas.// They do not make any change. They explain how Kṛṣṇa is the greatest. Not that comment in a different way and deviate you that Kṛṣṇa is ordinary man.

So Kṛṣṇa, from Kṛṣṇa, the next expansion is Baladeva, //svayaṁ prakāśa.// And from Baladeva, there is //catur-vyūha:// Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha, Pradyumna. So again there is, from Saṅkarṣaṇa, there is Nārāyaṇa. From Nārāyaṇa, there is another expansion, the same: Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna, Aniruddha. And from that Saṅkarṣaṇa, there is //puruṣāvatāra,// Mahā-Viṣṇu. From Mahā-Viṣṇu, there is Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. From Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, there is Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. The Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is situated in everyone's heart. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. In this way, Kṛṣṇa is expanding in so many ways. By personal expansion, by the expansion of His energy, by the expansion of His differentiated parts and parcels. Just like we are. We living entities are //vibhinnāṁśa.// We are also expansions of Kṛṣṇa. So He is expanding Himself in so many ways. //Svāṁśa, vibhinnāṁśa,// and //śakti, taṭasthā-śakti, cit-śakti, antaraṅga-śakti, bahiraṅga-śakti.// So we have to understand Kṛṣṇa in that way. And if we study scrutinizingly all these literatures, we shall come to the conclusion that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And if there is any name of God, that is perfectly given in this word, //Kṛṣṇa,// "all-attractive." There are many diverse meaning of Kṛṣṇa given by the //ācāryas,// but on the whole, Kṛṣṇa is the actual name of God.

So how you have to... For ordinary man, how one can understand Kṛṣṇa, that He is all-pervading? He is all-pervading. He is everywhere. Now, how to appreciate that He is all-pervading? That direction is given by Kṛṣṇa Himself. If we follow the direction of Kṛṣṇa, how to appreciate Him, then naturally and surely we shall come to the point to understand Kṛṣṇa, although He is all-expansive. So Kṛṣṇa says,

> raso 'ham apsu kaunteya
> prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ
> praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu
> śabdaḥ khe pauruṣaṁ nṛṣu
> [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]

Just try to understand Kṛṣṇa by your daily experience. Kṛṣṇa says that "When you drink water and when you quench your thirst, when you feel the nice taste of water, that taste I am." Kṛṣṇa says. So you can understand Kṛṣṇa daily as soon as you drink water. Why one should say that there is no God? You just try to appreciate God according to the prescription given by God. Then you'll understand.

Just like a doctor gives you medicine and he gives you direction also that "You drink this medicine, take the bottle and take two drops or five drops," as he gives direction. Then gradually you understand that by taking that medicine, you are being cured, you are feeling in health. Similarly, this prescription given by Kṛṣṇa... This is meditation actually. When we meditate upon the taste of the water, that means we are meditating on Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa says //prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:// "I am the sunshine, moonshine." So who has not seen the sunshine? If you have seen sunshine and if you follow this prescription given by Kṛṣṇa, then early in the morning you'll see Kṛṣṇa. Why do you say that "I have not seen Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is not present before Me"? But you follow Kṛṣṇa's instruction, and He will be present. He is present; simply we have to purify our eyes and senses to understand Him. That is required. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu// [Bs. 5.38]. Suppose you have a beloved friend. As soon as you hear telephone call, "Who is it?" "I am this." "Oh." You immediately see him. Does it not? Immediately, by the sound. Why? Because you are known to him, you are in love with him. Similarly, in this way, if you develop your dormant love of Kṛṣṇa, you'll see Kṛṣṇa in every moment. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38].

It is not at all difficult to see Kṛṣṇa. Why do you say, "Can you show me God?" Why you are not seeing God? Here is God. So Kṛṣṇa says, //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. So who has not seen the sunshine? Who has not seen the moonshine? Simply to understand, one has to understand that what is this sunshine? The sunshine is the reflection of Kṛṣṇa's bodily effulgence. Just like what is this moonshine? This is reflection of the sunshine. Similarly, the sun is also reflection of the //brahma-jyotir.// And what is the //brahma-jyotir? Brahmajyoti// is Kṛṣṇa's bodily effulgence. Then why do you say that you have not seen Kṛṣṇa? There are many other instances. Kṛṣṇa is giving some of them. If you study, if you meditate upon them, then you will see Kṛṣṇa gradually. He will be revealed. He'll be present immediately. It is all revelation. Not that by your eyes you can see. But if you follow the prescription, the direction, you will see Kṛṣṇa daily, always, twenty-four hours.

So when one is elevated devotee, //mahā-bhāgavata//---he is called //mahā-bhāgavata//---he does not see anything but Kṛṣṇa. Everywhere he sees Kṛṣṇa. //Sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhe nā dekhe tāra mūrti// [[books:cc:madhya:8:274|[Cc. Madhya 8.274]]]. He is seeing on the seaside a great ocean, a great sea, but he is not seeing the sea, but he is seeing Kṛṣṇa. He's [seeing] Kṛṣṇa's energy, how Kṛṣṇa's energy is working, and it is producing such vast ocean and sea. He is thinking like that. That is meditation. Anywhere he goes, he simply thinks of Kṛṣṇa. //Sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhe nā dekhe tāra mūrti.// He does not see the material form of anything. //Sarvatra haya nija iṣṭa-deva-sphūrti.// Everywhere he sees Kṛṣṇa. This is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So one has to develop. How one can develop? This is the process: //śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte,// if you hear. And as you go on hearing, your dirty things on the heart becomes clear. This hearing process is so nice.

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛt satām
> [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]

If you simply hear about Kṛṣṇa. Just like we are speaking about Kṛṣṇa from this //Bhagavad-gītā.// So if you try to understand Kṛṣṇa as directed by Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa will also cooperate with you. Just like a teacher, when he sees that a student is very intelligent, he is following the direction, the teacher is more interest, takes more interest in that student. That is natural. If the teacher says, "My dear child, my dear boy, you write in this way," and if he tries, then the teacher takes more interest. Similarly, as soon as you will try to understand Kṛṣṇa according to the direction given by Him, Kṛṣṇa is within you, He will help you more and more. //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, "I give him special intelligence to understand."

So therefore our duty is to follow the instruction of Kṛṣṇa as it is given. So Kṛṣṇa says, //praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu.// The //oṁkāra, praṇava... oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ.// The Vedic //mantras, oṁ bhagavate vāsudevāya namaḥ.// This //oṁkāra,// this //praṇava,// is Kṛṣṇa. So anyone who is chanting the Vedic hymns, and as soon as he vibrates this sound, transcendental sound, //om,// here is Kṛṣṇa. So how we can avoid Kṛṣṇa? Simply we have to know. You have to purify your eyes. You have to purify your ears. You have to purify your hands. You have to purify your legs. In this way, when your senses are purified in every step, in every moment, you will see Kṛṣṇa, nothing but Kṛṣṇa. The purificatory process---just to purify the eyes. Kṛṣṇa is present before you in //arcā-mūrti, arcāvatāra,// nicely dressed by the devotees. //Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā.// It is the duty of the devotee to decorate the //śrī-vigraha,// the form, transcendental form of Kṛṣṇa very nicely so that thousands of people may come in the temple and see Kṛṣṇa. And as you go on seeing Kṛṣṇa and your eyes become purified, then you will see Kṛṣṇa, how nice Kṛṣṇa is. Just like when Caitanya Mahāprabhu entered the Jagannātha temple, as soon as He saw Kṛṣṇa, immediately He fainted because His eyes were prepared to see Kṛṣṇa.

So we have to prepare our eyes to see. We have to prepare our ears to hear about Kṛṣṇa. In this way we can see Kṛṣṇa. And this is the process, how to... Just like we use our tongue. That is one of our senses. So Kṛṣṇa says that //raso 'ham apsu kaunteya// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. Everyone drinks water. So he tastes it, relishes the taste of the water. So as soon as he relishes the taste of the water, according to the direction of //Bhagavad-gītā,// he can see Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, by the tongue you can eat //bhagavat-prasādam,// the foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as you taste the foodstuff offered to Kṛṣṇa, you immediately remember Kṛṣṇa, how nicely Kṛṣṇa has taken this foodstuff. So by the tongue you can begin. Simply by eating //kṛṣṇa-prasādam,// without reading any Vedic literature, without reading even //Bhagavad-gītā,// if you simply think of Kṛṣṇa, "How nicely Kṛṣṇa has tasted this foodstuff," you become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

So to become Kṛṣṇa conscious is not very difficult job. Simply you have to follow the direction. That's all. But if you manufacture your own meaning, commentation on //Bhagavad-gītā,// then you are deviated. You are lost. //Śrama eva hi kevalam// [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]. Then such kind of reading //Bhagavad-gītā// is simply waste of time and energy. That's all. Therefore those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, who are not hearing from Kṛṣṇa conscious personalities, they are simply wasting time. The so-called reading of //Bhagavad-gītā,// lecture on //Bhagavad-gītā,// without Kṛṣṇa... God, kingdom of God without God. We want kingdom of God, peace and prosperity, but without God. There must not be God. That is our secular government. We want kingdom of God, but without God. That is not possible. If you give up God or God's relationship, there is no question of kingdom of God or peace and prosperity.

Then Kṛṣṇa says, //praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu śabdaḥ khe pauruṣaṁ nṛṣu.// When one man is famous... //Yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ mama tejo 'ṁśa-sambhavam.// Anything extraordinary, if you find Kṛṣṇa is the most extraordinary personality, but even within this world, if you find some great leader, great politician, great scientist, great businessman... There are so many. And he is very famous. So you should know that this fame and name of this person is due to Kṛṣṇa's mercy. You see Kṛṣṇa there. Nobody can be greater than any other friend unless he is specially bestowed the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ mama tejo 'ṁśa-sambhavam.// A little portion of Kṛṣṇa's mercy is there. Kṛṣṇa is most opulent. //Aiśvaryasya samagrasya.// You can claim that you are proprietor of ten //crores// of rupees or other can claim that "I am proprietor of fifty //crores// of rupees," and other can claim hundred //crores// of rupees, but nobody can claim that "I am the proprietor of all the money that is available within this material world." Nobody can say that. Even Brahmā cannot say. But Kṛṣṇa, oh, His description is that //samagrasya aiśvaryasya:// "All the wealth that is conceivable, He is the proprietor." So any wealthy person, any rich person you see within this material world, it should be understood that a portion of Kṛṣṇa's money has been taken by him. That's all. Nobody can claim that "I am the proprietor of all the money that is here in this material world." That is not possible. So if that man also thinks that "Whatever money I have got, it is Kṛṣṇa's money, Kṛṣṇa's mercy, Kṛṣṇa has mercifully given me this money," then what is his next duty? He should spend it for Kṛṣṇa. That is the proper utilization of money. Similarly, if one is famous, he should utilize his fame for Kṛṣṇa's service. Suppose I am trying to spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, but if a very famous man tries for it, it will be very quickly spread. That is the utilization of his fame. If a scientist, if he proves Kṛṣṇa's supremacy by scientific law, then his knowledge in science is perfect.

So everyone who possesses anything, if he knows that it is the gift of Kṛṣṇa and it should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa, then his life is successful.

> ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā
> varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ
> svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya
> saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam
> [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]

//Saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam.// It doesn't matter what you are. You may be an engineer, you may be a lawyer, you may be a businessman. Whatever you are, it doesn't matter. But try to satisfy Kṛṣṇa by your profession, by you occupation. Then you are successful. //Saṁsiddhi.// It doesn't matter what you are doing. It doesn't require that you have to give up your profession as a lawyer and join us as a //sannyāsī// and dance. if you cannot do that... Everyone can do that, but if you think that you cannot do this, then utilize your profession for Kṛṣṇa's service. Then you become perfect.

So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a necessity for the members of this Society; it is the necessity of everyone throughout the whole world, without any discrimination. One has to take this advantage to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, to understand Kṛṣṇa in this way. Then the result will be sublime. //Yo jānāti tattvataḥ. Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ.// Just like anyone who understands that the taste of the water is Kṛṣṇa's energy, the sunshine is Kṛṣṇa's energy, the moonshine is Kṛṣṇa's energy, the Vedic //mantras,// that is also to please Kṛṣṇa... And the sound vibrated in the sky, or anywhere, the sound element is Kṛṣṇa. And the energy or the name, fame, opulence of big men of this world, that is also Kṛṣṇa. In this way, if we study Kṛṣṇa, then we know Him gradually. And as soon as we understand Him, //janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ:// "One who understands in truth," //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]], "immediately he becomes liberated, so much so that after quitting this body he comes to Me."

So what is the difficulty? Even in your ordinary life you can study Kṛṣṇa, you can understand Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa will help you. As soon as you begin studying Kṛṣṇa, understanding Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa will help you from within. Kṛṣṇa is with you. Kṛṣṇa is not far away. He is so kind that He is sitting in your heart as your friend just to help you, how you become liberated from this material contamination. Why you do not take this advantage? Every sane man should take advantage of this instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā,// but rightly, as it is said. Then anywhere he may be, it doesn't matter, he is a liberated person.

> īhā yasya harer dāsye
> karmaṇā manasā girā
> nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu
> jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate

Anyone who is trying to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and being Kṛṣṇa conscious he is trying to serve Kṛṣṇa sincerely... He may be situated anywhere. It does not matter, he is Indian or Hindu or Mussulman or Christian or this or that. Simply if he thinks of Kṛṣṇa always in the process as described here, he becomes liberated.

So you can become liberated at your home. Simply you have to think of Kṛṣṇa. The //gopīs// were so elevated devotees. What was their function? The only function was that they were always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Lord Caitanya therefore recommends, //ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇā yā kalpitā.// These //vraja-vadhūs,// name... [end]
