====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.16 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> ...śrī-gurave namaḥ

**[When will Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī Prabhupāda, who has established within this material world the mission to fulfill the desire of Lord Caitanya, give me shelter under his lotus feet?]**

I offer my respectful obeisances unto Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, Śrī Nityānanda Prabhu, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and all His devotees, headed by Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura. I then offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī and all the gopīs, headed by Lalitā and Viśākhā.]**

**[O my dear Kṛṣṇa, ocean of mercy, You are the friend of the distressed and the source of creation. You are the master of the cowherd men and the lover of the //gopīs,// especially Rādhārāṇī. I offer my respectful obeisances unto You.]**

**[My dear Lord, and the spiritual energy of the Lord, kindly engage me in Your service. I am now embarrassed with this material service. Please engage me in Your service.]**

Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for your coming here and participating in this great movement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we have been discussing yesterday that //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. So miscreant, sinful life cannot help us in making progress. That we have repeatedly discussed, that we have to refrain from sinful activities. As we have stated several times, //yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam.// So the pillars of sinful life are four. They are, according to //śāstra,// that //striya-sūnā-pāna-dyūta yatra pāpāś catur-vidhā// [[books:sb:1:17:38|[SB 1.17.38]]]. Four kinds of sinful activities, they are considered the pillars of sinful life. What is that? Illicit sex life. In the human society, anywhere, everywhere, there is a system, civilized method of system, of sex life, which is called married life. This married life is just like a license for sex life. In the //śāstra// it is said, //loke vyavāyāmiṣa-madya-sevā nityā hi jantor na hi tatra codanā.// Those who are conditioned souls, this eating, sleeping, mating, these are the necessities of the body. In the spiritual world, these three things, four things, are conspicuous by absence. There is no necessity of eating there, no sleeping, no mating, no defense. That is spiritual life.

So in order to advance in spiritual life, we have to voluntarily decrease these demands of the body. That is called //tapasya.// In our country especially, many great saintly persons, sages, even kings, voluntarily they would give up these demands of the body, not that artificially increasing these demands of the body. That will not help us in spiritual life. So this //strī-saṅga,// or association with woman, that is a demand of the body. //Loke vyavāyāmiṣa-madya-sevā. Āmiṣa// means nonvegetarian foods. Eating flesh, fish, eggs, these are called //āmiṣa.// And //madya// means wine, liquor. So all the conditioned souls, they have got a natural inclination for sex life, intoxication, and eating fish, eat... They have got a natural inclination. Even ants, they have got all these inclinations. Expert psychologists and medical men, they have studied that even the ant, it has got also the same propensities. //Loke vyavāyāmiṣa-madya-sevā.// So when there is legalized, or marriage under religious principle, it is to be understood a sort of concession.

In the //Purāṇas...// There are //tāmasika-purāṇas// where it is recommended that if you want to eat flesh, then you can get a goat and sacrifice before Goddess Kālī and you can eat that. The purpose is that if a conditioned soul has got the natural tendencies, then why they are mentioned in the //śāstras?// The idea is... Just like Lord Buddha. Lord Buddha, his mission was to stop animal killing. //Ahiṁsā paramo dharmaḥ.// Lord Buddha appeared, being compassionate with the poor animals. //Sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam.// There is a description of Lord Buddha's activities by a Vaiṣṇava poet, Jayadeva Gosvāmī. He says, praying to Lord Buddha,

> nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātaṁ
> sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam
> keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare

Lord Buddha appeared to stop this animal killing. But because in the //Purāṇas// there are sometimes regulative principle of killing animal, therefore he had to deny the authority of //Vedas,// because those who are after killing animals, they will find some clue that "Here in the //Vedas// the animal-killing is sometimes recommended." But that animal-killing is not a, I mean to say, instigation that "You go on killing animals." You can understand by a nice example. Just like the government opens liquor shop. It does not mean the government is encouraging to drink liquor. It is not like that. The idea is that if government does not allow some drunkards to drink, they will create havoc. They will distill illicit distillation of liquor. To check them, the government opens liquor shop with very, very great, high price. The cost... If the cost is one rupee, government excise department charges sixty rupees.

So the idea is not to encourage, but to restrict. The idea is prohibition, at least in our country. Similarly, when there is allowance for sex life or meat-eating or drinking in the //śāstras,// they are not meant for instigating that "You go on with this business as much as you can." No. Actually they are meant for restriction. Therefore, for spiritual advancement of life, one has to know these basic knowledge, how we have to lead our life in order to make advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We have therefore these restrictions, that nobody can have illicit sex life; nobody can eat meat and fish or eggs, like that; nobody can touch any kinds of intoxication, including smoking cigarettes and drinking tea---they are also intoxicants; and nobody can indulge in gambling. So these things are necessary.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna. Sukṛti. Sukṛti// means those who are living pious life, and these are the basic principles of living pious life; no illicit sex life... Sex life is required, but there is already in the //śāstra// a license: "You can have sex life with your religiously married wife. Not otherwise." Actually, married sex life is not required, but it is just like license. The same thing, that there is no necessity of drinking wine, but those who are habituated, those who want to drink, for them, government opens, under so many restrictions, a liquor shop. The //śāstra// also gives us this license. The Gosvāmīs of Vṛndāvana, they were ideal saintly persons. About them it is said, //nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau.// They conquered over the necessities of this body, which is called //viṣaya.// Conquering over sleeping, conquering over sex life, and conquering over eating, these things are required. Pious life means gradually decreasing the unnecessary bodily demands. That is pious life. That is the sum and substance. Because Kṛṣṇa says here that //catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtinaḥ:// "Those who are living pious life." And those who are not living pious lives, they are called //duṣkṛtina,// sinful life.

So by indulging in sinful life it is not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is, Kṛṣṇa also says in various places in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// I have repeatedly informed you, //yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpam.// One who is completely free from all sinful life... //Janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.// This is //puṇya-karma,// not to indulge in illicit sex life, not to indulge in nonvegetarian diet, not to indulge in gambling, and not to indulge in intoxicants. So //catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna ārto arthārthī jñānī jijñāsuḥ.// Four kinds of men who are actually leading pious life, such persons... [applause] Hare Kṛṣṇa. Such persons, when they are distressed... //Ārta// means distressed. We have go so many distresses in this material life: //tri-tāpa,// three kinds of distresses, pertaining to the body, pertaining to the mind, distresses offered by other living entities. //Adhibhautika, adhyātmika, adhidaivika.// We are always in distress; that is a fact. But there is a covering influence of //māyā// that even in distressed condition, we think that we are happy. That is covering influence of //māyā.//

So //ārto arthārthī. Arthārthī. Ārta// and //arthārthī,// these two qualities are alleged to belong to the //gṛhasthas.// And //jñānī// or //jijñāsuḥ,// these qualities are supposed to be belonging to the //tyāgīs.// The //bhogīs...// The //gṛhasthas// are called //bhogīs,// and the //tyāgīs// are //brahmacārīs// and //sannyāsīs.// So //jñānī,// when he makes searching after God, there is no question of being put into distressed condition or in need of money. They are searching after God for God's sake, what is the nature of God. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// They are inquiring, inquisitive about Brahman, what is the nature of Brahman. They are called //jñānī.// And //jijñāsuḥ,// they are also within the category of the //jñānīs.// So the //jñānīs// and the //jijñāsuḥ,// inquisitive, they are better than the //ārta// and the //arthārthī. Ārta// means distress, and //arthārthī// means those who are in need of money. So even being //ārta// or even being distressed and in need of money, we approach Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa says //mām.// Not any other demigods. //Catur-vidhā bhajante mām. Mām// means, Kṛṣṇa says, //mām// means Kṛṣṇa. So four kinds of men, those who are leading pious life, //sukṛtino 'rjuna...// Because they have no other alternative than to approach God for mitigating their distress. Actually our inventions or so many distressed mitigating instruments... Just like medicine. Take for example. When a man is diseased, generally the counterpart is physician and good medicine. But //śāstra// says that actually they are not counteracting agents, because it is found that a man suffering from certain type of disease, although attended by the first-class physician and although offered first-class medicine, he dies. Why? Because there is no sanction of the Supreme Lord.

So our counteracting method, even though they are very efficient, still, unless it is sanctioned by Guru and God, they will not be effective. There are many such examples. Some years ago, perhaps you know, in America, they started one very strong and stout ship. It was known... I think it was named //Titanic.// So it was guaranteed that it will never be drowned; it is so well-looking. And all the important men of America started in that ship for the first time, and after few miles immediately it was drowned. So in spite of all scientific protection, in spite of all good brains behind the manufacture of this //Titanic// ship, it was drowned. So in this way we have to study that this //ārta// and //arthārthī,// because they are, their background is //sukṛtina,// pious activities, they know that without God's help we cannot mitigate any of our distressed condition or needy condition. Therefore the //ārta// and //arthārthī// whose background is pious life, they approach God: "Kṛṣṇa, please help me," although it is not pure devotion.

Pure devotion is without any desire for material benefits. Just like it is enjoined in the //śāstras, samyak śubha-kriyā matiḥ pramāṇam.// The chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// should not be taken as a mitigating agent for our distressed condition. No pure devotee will desire for any material benefit by worshiping Kṛṣṇa or chanting His holy name. That is also considered as one of the offenses of ten kinds of offense. //Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.// But in spite... Even they are not pure devotees... Purity of devotion, it takes time. But still, in the //śāstra// it is recommended that even if you have some material desires... //Akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]. //Akāma// and //sarva-kāma. Sarva-kāma,// those who are //ārtas,// always in distressed condition, or //mokṣa-kāma... Mokṣa-kāma// means those who are desiring after liberation. They are also demanding something. Those who are //mokṣa-kāmī,// they are also demanding something. The //siddhi-kāmīs,// they are also demanding something. But the pure devotee does not demand anything. That is pure...

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

That sample of pure devotion is found in Vṛndāvana amongst the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. And Kṛṣṇa was present. He was demonstrating His transcendental pastimes of Vṛndāvana. These //gopīs// and the cowherds boys, they were the best examples of becoming pure devotees.

So Kṛṣṇa says that //catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna.// So Arjuna also said, //paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān. Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. When Arjuna understood the //Bhagavad-gītā,// he understood Kṛṣṇa also. And he said, "Kṛṣṇa, You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead." //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. "You are the supreme shelter," //paraṁ dhāma. Pavitram.// This word is there, //pavitra.// So without being //pavitra,// without being pious, without being free from contamination of material activities, nobody can approach Kṛṣṇa. That's a fact. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He orders that "Even if you have got some //kāmanam,// some desire, material desire, still, you can take shelter upon Me." //Sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. "You do not take shelter of anything else. Simply depend on Me." //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.// "You haven't got to depend on anything else. I will give you protection." So we have to take faith in the words of Kṛṣṇa and put our complete faith and devotion at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. That will make us happy and make progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in order to achieve the highest goal of life, back to Godhead, back to home. //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]].

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement purely based on the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is not a manufactured thing. As you are hearing for so many days, our basic principle is the //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is not that we have manufactured something, as there are so many manufactured processes. So if we actually take Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously, as it is assured in the //Bhagavad-gītā// by the Supreme Lord, Kṛṣṇa, we are sure to achieve the result without any doubt. Kṛṣṇa assures, //mā śucaḥ:// "Don't be doubtful. Simply surrender unto Me. I shall take care of you." The whole //Bhagavad-gītā// is taught in that way. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. //Ahaṁ hi sarva-yajñānāṁ bhoktā ca prabhur eva ca.// In this way, in //Bhagavad-gītā// we'll find, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. Kṛṣṇa is the Absolute Personality of Godhead. So His instructions are there.

So our request on behalf of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, that from... Of course, as far as possible, we have tried to convince you during this eight-days' function, but if you also cooperate with us, //taj-joṣaṇād āśv apavarga-vartmani,// then the result will be very quick. Simply if you go back home, hearing all these instructions of Kṛṣṇa, that will not help. Of course, any sane man will think over this. That is recommended in the //śāstra.// Through good association, by hearing from the devotees, one becomes purified, one becomes thoughtful about Kṛṣṇa. But he practically applies in his life the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, then he makes progress in spiritual life or towards the ultimate goal of life, to go back to home, back to Godhead. It is not a function that there is no planet as Kṛṣṇaloka. No. There is. From //Bhagavad-gītā// you have understood. There is another nature. Besides this material nature, there is another nature, which is called //sanātana-dhāma. Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyaḥ// [[books:bg:8:20|[Bg. 8.20]]]. And there are innumerable planets, they are called Vaikuṇṭhalokas, as much as there are innumerable planets within this material world.

So these are all facts. If you believe //śāstra,// if you have got faith in the //śāstra,// then you have to take this path of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in order to transfer yourself to the spiritual world. There is a spiritual world. Because we are spirit soul, without being transferred to the spiritual world we cannot have real happiness or real enjoyment. That is a fact. All these informations are there very explicitly. You do not try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// by malinterpretation or malcommentary. Try to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, and you will benefit. That is our request. Of course, we are finishing this ceremony today here, but if opportunity is there, we can continue the study of //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, and if Kṛṣṇa gives us opportunity, we shall try to serve you again, more and more.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [applause] [end]
