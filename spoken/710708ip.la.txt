====== Śrī Īśopaniṣad Lecture [partially recorded] ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Sings along with Govindam Prayers... Then recites Sri Isopanisad verses 1–12 with response from devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Page.

**Devotee:**
Page fourteen in the middle, almost the middle of the first paragraph. The Vedas are not known like that the Vedic knowledge was originally imparted into the heart of Brahma the first created living being and Brahma in his term disseminated the knowledge to his sons and disciples who have continued the process down thorough history.

**Prabhupāda:**
Formerly the spiritual master, the disciplic succession, there are two ways. One is called //śaukra// and another is called //sautra. Śaukra// means succession from the seminal. Just like son. Son is born by the semina, and the disciple is born by Vedic knowledge. So the one familywise is called //śaukra. Śukra// means semina, coming from the //śukra,// and the other is //sautra,// by hearing. So spiritual master... In India still there are //gotras. Gotras// means coming from that great sage. Just like our family belongs to the //Gautama gotra.// Gautama Ṛṣi, from him the familywise //gotra,// and similarly disciplic succession is also //gotra.// There is no difference between //putra// and //chatra. Putra// means son, and //chatra// means disciple. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita said, //putrāṁś ca śiṣyāṁś ca;// they are equally treated. Both of them equally eligible for hereditary rites from the person, either he is son or disciple. So Brahmā distributed knowledge to some... Practically everyone was his son because he was the first living creature. So later on, disciples also, son's son. So in this way Brahmā distributed this Vedic knowledge, some to the sons, some to the... Vyāsadeva also, he distributed knowledge, some to his sons, some to his disciples. That is explained in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So that is the process of disseminating Vedic knowledge. Then?

**Karandhara:**
[reading:]"The Lord being //pūrṇam,// or all-perfect, there is no chance of His being subjected to the laws of material nature, while the living entities and the inanimate objects are all controlled by the laws of nature and thus ultimately by the potency of the Lord. The //Īśopaniṣad// is a part of the //Yajur Veda.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
There are four //Vedas---Sāma Veda, Yajur Veda, Ṛg Veda,// and //Atharva Veda.// Originally there was one //Veda,// but later on, Vyāsadeva divided them into four. So //Yajur Veda// is one of the //Vedas,// and the //Īśopaniṣad// is stated there. All the //Upaniṣads// are stated in the different kinds of //Vedas.// Therefore //Upaniṣad// is accepted as Vedic study. Go on.

**Karandhara:**
"The //Īśopaniṣad// is a part of the //Yajur Veda,// and as such, it contains information as to the proprietorship of all things that exist within the universe."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like evidence. Evidence... [aside:] Now you can sit down. Evidence, whenever we want to give evidence... Just like in law court, the evidence, you have to cite the section or the preamble of the laws. Similarly, in our human civilization this evidence is //Vedas.// If you find something stated in the //Vedas,// that you have to accept. That's all. Axiomatic truth. And because the //Vedas// were particularly studied by the //brāhmaṇas,// high-class qualified //brāhmaṇas,// therefore they are also accepted as authority. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was at Purī, the king of that place, Mahārāja Pratāparudra, he inquired from Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, "Oh, what is your opinion about this Caitanya who has come here?" He said that "He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." So the king immediately accepted it. King said, "Oh, He is Supreme Personality of Godhead?" So he accepted immediately, just like... There is no question of experimenting. Because an authority like Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya is stating, a //brāhmaṇa// and... He was very learned scholar. You know Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's name. So because he said that "He is Supreme Personality..." He did not ask any storekeeper, but he asked a learned //brāhmaṇa// who knows things. So similarly, we have to accept in that way. In each and every case, if we want to research, it is not possible, because our senses are blunt senses. What you can do? //Acintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet.// The //śāstra// says that "Things which are beyond your conception, beyond your mental speculation"---//avāṅ-manasā gocaraḥ//---"neither you can express by words, neither you can think of." //Avāṅ-manasā gocaraḥ.//

So such things it is useless, try to understand by arguments. That is simply nonsense. You can, of course, inquire, but that inquiry is not challenge. If you inquire from your spiritual master by challenge, then it is your misfortune. You have to inquire from the spiritual master---that is indicated-//sevayā,// by service, by making him satisfied. //Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā// [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]. First of all you have to surrender, and then you have to please him by service. //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ.// If you can please him, then naturally Kṛṣṇa is pleased upon you. That is the injunction. So this //praśna...// First of all you should find out somebody where you can surrender. If there is duplicity in surrender, that is useless. First of all see whether you can surrender there; then accept him spiritual master and then please him by your service and inquiry. That is Vedic principle.

Thank you very much. [end]
