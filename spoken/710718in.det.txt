====== Initiations ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Beads. Give me beads. [chants //japa//] Where is that //tulasī// plant? Today's not very hot. Warm... It is all right. [Chants //japa,// devotee chants purificatory //mantras.// More //japa.// Devotee chants //mantra// again. Prabhupāda corrects his pronunciation. More //japa.// Jagadīśa gives lecture while Prabhupāda chants //japa.// Then more //japa.//] The ten offenses, explain. [Jagadīśa explains ten offenses from book] Give them chairs. Some ladies are standing.

**Jagadīśa:**
[continues lecture on offenses] ...the mind will be controlled. And we can fix the mind of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet. The mind will be wavering here and there, but if we control the lower self...

**Prabhupāda:**
Or, in other words, when you fix up your mind in Kṛṣṇa, then senses will be automatically controlled. This way is difficult. That way is easy. You fix up your mind... //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, he was a emperor, but he was a great devotee. How? He always fixed up his mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. //Vacāṁsi. Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor. Kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor,// on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, he fixed up his mind. //Vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.// The next is the tongue. Mind fixed up, then the next sense is, important sense, is the tongue. Next to the mind, tongue should be controlled. How? By chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and eating Kṛṣṇa //prasādam.// Then other senses will be automatically controlled. [continues chanting //japa//]

**Jagadīśa:**
[continues lecture] We must know the goal. We must know by intelligence...

**Prabhupāda:**
That verse is not quoted there? //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.// Leg should be engaged to go to the temple of Kṛṣṇa. Hand should be engaged for cleansing the temple. Nose should be engaged for smelling //tulasī// which is offered to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Ear should be engaged for hearing about Kṛṣṇa. Eyes should be engaged for seeing Kṛṣṇa beautifully dressed. These things are... In this way the temple worship means all these senses being engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, mind and senses. Then they can, cannot do any harm. They're already engaged. They cannot have any other engagement. And if you keep vacant the mind and the senses, then //māyā// will capture. Then eye will go to see the cinema and tongue will go to the restaurant, for rooster[?] [cocktails?], what is called? These things will be engaged. Yes. [continues //japa//]

**Jagadīśa:**
[continues lecture] So we must always try to fix our mind on Kṛṣṇa's activities, Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhavauṣadhi śrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt.// Kṛṣṇa's pastimes are described as the medicine of the disease //bhava. Bhava// means repeated birth and death. This is a disease. So //bhavauṣadhi.// The medicine, panacea, for curing this disease, //bhavauṣadhi.// At the same time, //śrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt:// it is very pleasing to hear, and very enlightening to the heart. Kṛṣṇa's name is so nice, Kṛṣṇa's pastime is so nice, that it is very pleasing, very satisfying, at the same time, it is the medicine for the disease of repeated birth and death. [continues //japa//]

**Jagadīśa:**
One of the qualities of...

**Prabhupāda:**
The more you become free from material harassment, the more you make advance in spiritual life, or the more you make advance in spiritual life, the more you become detached to the material life. These are the tests. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. //Bhakti,// devotional life, spiritual life, the test is that //viraktir anyatra. Anyatra// means beyond, without Kṛṣṇa, everything becomes detestful. The example is given just like a hungry man, when he's eating, as he's eating so he's feeling satisfaction and no hunger, proportionately. And at one time it will come, he'll say, "No, I don't want any more. I am completely satisfied." //Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]]. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. He said, "I am now completely satisfied. I have, I haven't got to ask anything, benediction." That is the progress and ultimate goal of //bhakti.// As soon as one is saturated with //bhakti,// he has no more demand, no more attraction for this material world. Not... Kṛṣṇa attraction means decreasing attraction for the material world. Go on. [chants //japa//] One can test his advancement for spiritual life, how he is being detached to the material life. That's all. It is not to be taken certificate from others. Just like when you eat, you haven't got to take certificate from others. You'll feel, "Yes, I'm satisfied." That's all. You don't require, while eating nicely, you don't require to take certificate: "Am I eating nicely?" You'll know yourself. [//japa//] Another example is given: the candy. Candy, when a man is suffering from jaundice disease, if you give him candy, he'll taste it bitter. That means more one is materially suffering, he'll not be interested to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But the example is this: The candy is the only medicine for jaundice. So we have to give him candy by force. And as he cure, as he cures, he'll say, "Oh, candy's very nice. Candy's sweet." So in the beginning we have to force. We have to give the medicine just like horse is given medicine. Three men required to induce medicine to the mouth of the horse. So this is our duty, to inject Hare Kṛṣṇa medicine just like pushing medicine in the throat of a horse. By force. [//japa//] [devotees chant prayers] Then neck, neck beads. Let them... [devotees continue prayers; devotee begins lecture again] Go on. I shall distribute this. Who is the...?

**Jagadīśa:**
Should I go on?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [Jagadīśa continues lecture] [break] Ātmārāma dāsa. //Ātmārāma// means who is satisfied with self-realization. Next. Purañjana was a great king, devotee, in the history. [devotees coming up, taking initiation.] Aprākṛta. //Aprākṛta// means transcendental. Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then, next? There are different stages of understanding. First understanding is direct perception, //pratyakṣa.// In Sanskrit word it is called //pratyakṣa,// direct understanding. That tenth-class understanding, that is not actually understanding, direct perception. But people are giving stress that "I want to see. I want to touch." This is called //pratyakṣa.// Then next is //parokṣa,// hearing from authorities. Then //aparokṣa,// realizing. Then //adhokṣaja// means beyond the perception of the senses. Then //aprākṛta,// transcendental. These are the stages for going to the //aprākṛta,// transcendental stage. From direct perception, then, //pratyakṣa, parokṣa,// to take instruction from others. Then realization. Then beyond these senses. Then //aprākṛta,// transcendental. So Kṛṣṇa is //aprākṛta.// Kṛṣṇa cannot be understood by direct sense perception. Gradually you have to rise to the //aprākṛta// stage, which is called //Vāsudeva// stage, beyond this material understanding. That will take time. You have to practice that. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Come on.

Hiraṇyagarbha. Hiraṇyagarbha is Lord Brahmā's name. Or Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu's name. Generally Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu's. Hiraṇyagarbha dāsa. That's all right.

Then, next. Where is...? No neck bead? How is that? Where is neck bead? Huh? Oh, these things are not good. It must be well equipped. Otherwise, what is the meaning of initiation? Give... No neck bead? Go on. First of all get neck beads. Who is next? You have got neck beads? That's all right. Viśvakarmā. Viśvakarmā is the engineer of this universe. Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// You know what are the rules and regulations? That's right.

Next? Come on. Dineśvara. Dineśvara is the name of sun, sun-god. Come on. We are all //dāsa,// not the person. When you call "Kṛṣṇa," "Kṛṣṇa" means Kṛṣṇa dāsa. When you call Dineśvara, Dineśvara, means Dineśvara's servant. Our position is always servant. //Dāsa-anudāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. Servant of the servant, servant of the servant, the more, the more you become on the lower status of servant, our position is greater. This is...

Come on. Next. You arranged for offering this sacrifice? You arranged? What is name? Mahā? Mahāvīra. Eh? M, h, r. Mahāvīra. Mahāvīra is the name of Hanumān, the servant of Lord Rāmacandra. He was very strong. He could raise even the hills for service of the Lord. Mahāvīra. //Mahā// means great, and //vīra// means hero.

Come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don't laugh. Then... Bahiṣmatī, one of the daughters of Manu. Come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa. You know, what are the rules? Tell me. Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

Come on. Next. Who's this? Oh, all right. Then how many still remaining? All right. [chants //japa//] First of all grains mixed up. [more //japa//] Come on. Take your. Come on. Whose beads are lying on the floor there? Whose beads? Oh, you never put it in the floor. When there is no bag, you put like this. Mahāyajñi, Mahāyajñi is a name of Lord Śiva. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Take. [more //japa//]

Uttamaśloka. Uttamaśloka means Kṛṣṇa who is chanted with best verses. Come on. [more //japa,// devotees chant prayers]. You keep it. You keep it. [prayers continued] So where is that, he has come? Waiting. I'm going just now. [more prayers, //japa//]

Bhagavatī. Goddess Durgā's name. Goddess Durgā, external energy of Kṛṣṇa. [more //japa,// prayers] Tapasvinī: who performs great austerity. Svarga dāsī. [Prabhupāda leaves, devotees continue prayers] [end]
