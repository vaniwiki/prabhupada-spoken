====== Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā, Verse 33 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam
> ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca
> vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.33]

So //advaita. Advaita// means without duality. //Advaita acyuta,// Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's expansion. Kṛṣṇa's expansion: Baladeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha, Pradyumna. Then Nārāyaṇa, then Mahā-Viṣṇu, Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu-innumerable expansions. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. Each and every form, Kṛṣṇa's, they are without any duality. Just like I and my photograph, that is my expansion, but it is not one; it is dual. What service you can take from me, you cannot take the service from the photograph. Therefore it is not //advaita;// it is //dvaita,// duality. You may have millions of photographs, but each one of them, they're different. But Kṛṣṇa, He has got millions of forms, they're one. That is the difference. //Advaitam acyutam. Acyutam// means one who does not fall down. Because he has expanded in so many forms, it does not mean the potency of Kṛṣṇa has decreased. The same thing you chant in the //Īśopaniṣad: pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. Kṛṣṇa is so full, //pūrṇa. Pūrṇa// means complete. If you take complete Kṛṣṇa from Kṛṣṇa, still, He is Kṛṣṇa. That you cannot understand in the materialistic condition, because if I have got one rupee or one dollar, if I take that one dollar, then it becomes zero. But Kṛṣṇa is so complete you go on taking Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, still, Kṛṣṇa is complete. //Advaita acyuta. Acyuta// means does not diminish or does not fall.

//Advaitam acyutam anādi. Anādi// means which has no beginning. Because we have got this material body we have got a beginning. You may ask somebody, "What is your birthday?" That means beginning. Anything material, it has got a beginning and end. Anything which has got beginning has got end also, and change also. So Kṛṣṇa has no beginning, there is no end, and there is no change. Try to understand. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. //Ananta// means unlimited. Unlimited forms, Kṛṣṇa. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam.// He's the original, oldest person. Because //ādyaṁ,// original. Just like if you find out in your family who is the original man, so as far as you can count, you go a hundred years, two hundred years back, find out who is the origin of your family members, so that man must be //Purāṇa. Purāṇa// means very old. Kṛṣṇa, being the original person, //ādi-puruṣam... Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ. Ādi// means original. So you do not think that he might have become very, very old. Because our material conception... Sometimes we paint picture: "God is the original person. Then He must be very old. He must have grown so much white, gray hairs." No. The Vedic knowledge says, //advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam// [Bs. 5.33]. The oldest man, but //nava-yauvanaṁ ca,// always just like a young man, sixteen to twenty years old. That is called //nava-yauvana.// When a man or woman comes to sixteen years, that is the beginning of youthful life. So sixteen to twenty years, this is very nice---in full energy. And that is the time for growth, intelligence. Unfortunately, we spoil this period, so we become less intelligent, life becomes shorter. If we spoil this period, then our life will be shortened. And if we keep this period complete celibacy, //brahmacārī,// then you can live up to hundred years. So this period is very nice. It is called //nava-yauvana,// just new youthful life. So Kṛṣṇa you'll find all new, always new youthful. You'll never find Kṛṣṇa's picture as old. //Nava-yauvanaṁ ca.//

Then again, it is said, //vedeṣu durlabha.// [aside:] What is that sound? //Vedeṣu durlabham. Vede// means in the Vedic literature, if you make research work how Kṛṣṇa is, then it will be very difficult. Then you come to the impersonal only. //Vedeṣu durlabham.// You have to go beyond the //Vedas.// What is that? //Vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau// [Bs. 5.33]. Kṛṣṇa is available through His confidential devotee. Not that if anyone has studied very nicely all Vedic literatures he'll understand Kṛṣṇa. No. Maybe, but it is very difficult. Kṛṣṇa can be delivered by His devotee, //ātma-bhaktau.// Therefore you have to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa's devotee. That is //paramparā// system. If you want to understand Kṛṣṇa, if you want to have Kṛṣṇa... Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung a very nice song. He's praying to a Vaiṣṇava, //vaiṣṇava ṭhākura tomāra kukkura bhuliyā jānaha more:// "Sir, Vaiṣṇava, you are Ṭhākura. You are as good as Kṛṣṇa, or God. Kindly accept me as your dog." //Vaiṣṇava ṭhākura tomāra kukkura bhuliyā jāna... Kukkura// means dog. Just like dog follows the master very faithfully. We have to learn something from the dog. The dog also is a teacher: how to become faithful to the master. That teaching we can have even from the dog. He is very satisfied. Whatever food you give, he'll not protest. Still, he'll remain faithful. There are so many good qualifications of a dog. So therefore Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, //vaiṣṇava ṭhākura tomāra kukkura bhuliyā jānaha more:// "Kindly accept me as your dog. I shall serve you faithfully." Why? //Kṛṣṇa se tomāra kṛṣṇa dite pāra:// "Because Kṛṣṇa is yours, you can deliver Kṛṣṇa." Very nice song. "Kṛṣṇa is yours. By your devotional service, you have made Kṛṣṇa your property; so you can deliver Kṛṣṇa to me. Therefore I want to follow you as faithfully as a dog." //Vedeṣu durlabham.// This is confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā: vedeṣu durlabha.// If you study independently all the //Vedas... Veda// is the source of knowledge. So //vedeṣu durlabha,// it will be difficult. But if we approach Kṛṣṇa's devotee, then it will be very easy. //Vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau.//

This is the next //śloka.// The record is //aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti// [Bs. 5.32]. Next //śloka// is this, //advaitam acyutam anādim.// You can repeat. //Advaita.// I say, you say. [devotees repeat:]

Thank you very much. [end]
