====== Initiations ======

**Aravinda:**
Mamatā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mamatā.

**Mamatā:**
Mamatā?

**Prabhupāda:**
M-a-m-a-t-a. Mamatā devī, "one who is very affectionate to everyone." Come on. You know the rules and regulation? What are those?

**Mamatā:**
No meat-eating, no taking of intoxicants, no illicit sex, and no gambling.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. How many rounds you will chant?

**Mamatā:**
Sixteen good rounds every morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Come on, next. [break] Ādi-pati. Ādi-pati means king. So you should be king. What is the business of king?

**Ādi-pati:**
To rule.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where you shall rule? You cannot say?

**Ādi-pati:**
What is the rule?

**Trivikrama:**
Where.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where you will rule? You will rule over your senses. (laughter) Come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa. You know how to rule?

**Ādi-pati:**
Everyone.

**Prabhupāda:**
The rules. You do not know the four rules?

**Ādi-pati:**
Oh, the rules. No meat-eating...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is the ruling.

**Ādi-pati:**
No illicit sex, no gambling...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, if you... Then you become king. Come on, next.

**Aravinda:**
Prācī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Prācī, yes. Prācī means one of the directions. Come on. You know the rules and regulations? (//japa//)

**Aravinda:**
Puru dāsa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Puru dāsa. There was a very powerful king. His name was Puru. He was a devotee. The same thing, to become ruler of the senses. Come on. We are all ruled by the senses. Senses dictate and we follow. This is the general condition, and we have to become ruler of the senses. Then it is successful. Generally people are ruled by the senses. My sense says, "Please take me to the cinema," the eyes. I immediately go and stand there three hours for the ticket. You see? So I am ruled by the senses. And when you will be strong enough, the eyes will say, "Please take me to the cinema," and you will say, "No, you cannot go to the cinema." Then you are ruler. So one is //go-dāsa. Go-dāsa// means servant of the senses. And one is //gosvāmī,// master of the senses. That is the difference between //gosvāmī// and //go-dāsa. Go// means senses. When we are servant of the senses, then we are in the material world. And when we are master of the senses, then we are in the spiritual world. Come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa. You have got. All right.

**Aravinda:**
Indriyāṇi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Indriyāṇi. Indriyāṇi, the queen of Lord Indra. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Come on. You know the rules and regulations? Thank you.

**Aravinda:**
Pratīci.

**Prabhupāda:**
Pratīci, one of the directions. You are also. Come on. (//japa//---break)

**Trivikrama:**
Bimali.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Trivikrama:**
Bimali, B-i-m-a-l-i.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bimalā, Bimalā. Bimalā means spotless, where there is no dirty things. You know the rules and regulations? Yes. If you follow the rules and regulation, then there will be no dirt. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (devotees chant //japa//) //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. Our, this process is simply to make the mind dirtyless. We are... Our mind is full of dirty things, so this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa means //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam,// cleansing the heart. And as soon as one is cleansed of the heart, that pure consciousness comes. Then he is liberated. //Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.// All problems solved immediately. Due to misunderstanding of our position we have created so many dirty things. (doorbell rings) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Is there somebody?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Door. (pause) Maṇḍaleśvara.

**Prabhupāda:**
Maṇḍeleśvara. Maṇḍaleśvara means a leader, leader of a group. He is called //maṇḍaleśvara.// Not ordinary rogues' group but Vaiṣṇava group. Hare Kṛṣṇa. There are different kinds of groups.

**Viṣṇujana:**
Naradevī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Naradevī. Naradevī means queen, like Queen Victoria. Is that all right? (laughter-girl offers obeisances) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Queen Victoria was very popular in British Empire. Yes.

**Trivikrama:**
Hṛṣīkeśa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hṛṣīkeśa. Hṛṣīkeśa means the same thing, master of the senses. //Hṛṣīka// means senses, and //hṛṣīka-īśa..., īśa// means ruler or master. So actually //hṛṣīkeśa// means Kṛṣṇa. He is the master of the senses. And //bhakti// means //hṛṣīka..., hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. Our //hṛṣīkeśa// means if we be under the control of Hṛṣīkeśa, then these senses now being used for other purposes, //upādhi,// designations... Just like one is very busy in his national work. Means he is giving service to a designation, falsely thinking that "I am this body," "This body is American," "This body is Indian," "This body is this." So under this false impression he is giving service. This is one stage. And when we are freed from this, all these false impressions, and give service to Kṛṣṇa, that is our perfect stage. So Hṛṣīkeśa means Hṛṣīkeśa dāsa, to become the servant of the Hṛṣīkeśa. Kṛṣṇa is Hṛṣīkeśa, so your name is Hṛṣīkeśa dāsa. Come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa. All right.

**Devotee:**
All glories to you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)
