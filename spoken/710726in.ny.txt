**Aravinda:**

**Aravinda:**

**Prabhupāda:**

**Aravinda:**
Viṣṇugadā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Viṣṇu?

**Aravinda:**
Viṣṇugadā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Viṣṇugadā. You know Viṣṇu has got the club? //Śaṅkha cakra gadā padma. Gadā,// the club. So you are that. You have to punish all the demons.

**Aravinda:**
Mahendra.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mahendra. Mahā-indra. Mahā-indra is the heavenly king. //Yas tu indra-gopa-mahā indra.// There are two kinds of //indra.// One is a small insect which is called indra-gopa, and beginning from this //indra// up to the //mahā-indra,// the king of heaven, they are all under the reaction of fruitive activities. //Yas tv indra-gopa-mahendra-mahā-sva-karma-phala-bhājanam āta...// Everyone is enjoying and suffering the result of his fruitive activities. //Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām// [Bs. 5.54]. But those who are in devotional service, they have no reaction of their work because they do not work for themselves. They are for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore there is no reaction. So Mahendra means the greatest king within this universe. So because he is representative of Kṛṣṇa, therefore we accept him as one of the devotees. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (aside:) Don't take this. (end)
