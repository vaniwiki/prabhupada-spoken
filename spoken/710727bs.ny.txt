====== Śrī Brahma-saṁhitā, Verse 33 ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// This verse, //aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛtti-manti// [Bs. 5.32], we have explained. Next verse is //advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. There are thirty-six verses in this record. You have chanted only three verses, three or four. So the next verse is,

> advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam
> ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca
> vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.33]

Kṛṣṇa, He has got multiforms. We are also Kṛṣṇa's forms, //vibhinnāṁśa.// There are two categories of forms, Kṛṣṇa's: //viṣṇu-tattva// and //jīva-tattva. Viṣṇu-tattva,// a Kṛṣṇa person, and //jīva-tattva,// separated personalities. So the //jīvas,// they are also Kṛṣṇa's forms, //vibhinnāṁśa.// They are called //vibhinnāṁśa.// Just imagine the living entities, innumerable forms there are. That is conditioned living entities. Whatever we see within this material world, that is only a fragment part of all the living entities. The major portion of the living entities, they are in the spiritual world. They are called //nitya-mukta,// ever-liberated. And we, in this material world, we are //nitya-baddha,// ever-conditioned. Besides that, Kṛṣṇa has got Viṣṇu //tattva// form, personal. Viṣṇu //tattva// form means that one form is as powerful as the other form. In the //vibhinnāṁśa// form, we are not as powerful as Kṛṣṇa. But there are forms of Kṛṣṇa who are as powerful as Kṛṣṇa. //Dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya// [Bs. 5.46]. Just like you take this candle and you light on another candle, another candle---but all these candles are of the same power, although the original candle is there. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and there are innumerable other forms of Godhead also. But they are as good as Kṛṣṇa. //Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. The potency of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is so great that if another Godhead is expanded, both of them are of the same potency. Therefore it is //advaita acyuta. Acyuta// means who never falls. Living entities, although they are forms of Kṛṣṇa, they fall down. Just like our present condition is fallen condition. We are in the matter. But the personal expansions, they never fall in the matter. Therefore another name of God, or Kṛṣṇa, is //Acyuta. Acyuta// means never falls.

//Advaita acyuta anādi.// Our beginning is from God, but God has no beginning. //Anādi. Advaita acyuta anādi ananta-rūpam,// although the forms are many millions and trillions. //Advaita acyuta anādi ananta-rūpam, ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam. Ādyam,// original. Therefore the oldest person. Kṛṣṇa, God is the original person; therefore the oldest person. Still //nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// But still He's always youth, youthful. //Vedeṣu durlabha.// To search out Kṛṣṇa by academic education, by mental speculation, by pursuits of different types of knowledge is not possible. //Advaita acyuta anādi ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam nava-yauvanam, vedeṣu durlabha.// You cannot find out Kṛṣṇa by simply academic education. //Adurlabha ātma-bhaktau.// But He is available from His devotee. If you approach a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he can deliver you Kṛṣṇa like anything: "Here is Kṛṣṇa. Take." Kṛṣṇa is so nice. He becomes a doll in the hands of devotee. He agrees. Just like before Mother Yaśodā He was trembling. Mother Yaśodā showed Him the cane.

So this is Kṛṣṇa's merciful pastime, that He becomes very easily available to the devotees. Otherwise it is very difficult to find out where is Kṛṣṇa, how is Kṛṣṇa. So our process is therefore to go through the devotees, not directly. Directly one cannot understand what Kṛṣṇa... //Vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi// [Bs. 5.33]. We worship Govinda, the original Personality of Godhead. That is our business.

Now you can begin. (end)
