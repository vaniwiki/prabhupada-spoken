====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.1 ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is my spectacles?

Lord Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, speaking about the topmost form of yoga system. In the Sixth Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā// He has explained the general //haṭha-yoga// system. Please remember that we are preaching this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement on the authority of //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is nothing manufactured. [dog barking] [pause] Whose dog? He may go away. So this //bhakti-yoga// system is authorized, and if you want to know about God, then you have to adopt this //bhakti-yoga// system. Because in the Sixth Chapter of //Bhagavad-gītā// it is concluded... [break] ...he who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa within himself.

When Kṛṣṇa recommended the yoga system, //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// system... //Aṣṭāṅga// means eightfolded different states of elevation: //yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, samādhi,// like that. //Dhyāna, dhāraṇā.// So the first step of yoga system, as recommended by Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority, is one has to select a very secluded place and sacred place. The //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// meditation cannot be performed in a fashionable city. It is not possible. One has to first of all select a nice place, sacred place. In India, therefore, those who are very serious to practice yoga system, they go to Himalaya, Haridwar. That is also Himalaya. Very secluded place. They remain there alone, and very restricted process of eating, sleeping. There is no question of mating. So those rules and regulations are very strict, and unless you follow, simply if you make a show of gymnastic, that is not perfection of yoga. Yoga means //indriya-saṁyama,// to control the senses. If you allow your senses unrestrictedly and if you make a show of yoga practice, that is not successful. It will never be successful.

So you have to select a nice place, sacred place. Then you have to sit right angular and you have to close your eyes half, not full, and see on the tip of your nose. You cannot change your //āsana.// There are so many rules and regulations which is not possible at the present moment. What to speak of at the present moment, even five thousand years ago, when circumstances of the world was different... And a personality like Arjuna, who was talking with Kṛṣṇa face to face... Just imagine what is his position. Arjuna belonged to the royal family. He was a great warrior and intimate friend of Kṛṣṇa and constantly living with Him. He, after hearing this process of yoga, //aṣṭāṅga-yoga,// he said, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me." He flatly said, admitted that "For me, these rules and regulation and practice and controlling the mind is not possible." He flatly denied.

So we have to think, five thousand years ago a personality like Arjuna, he expressed his inability to practice this //aṣṭāṅga-yoga// system, and what to speak of us? Therefore the conclusion is that in this age when people are very short-living... At least, in India the average duration of life is thirty-five years. In your country it may be more than that, but actually, as your grandfather lived for one hundred years, you cannot live. The things are changing. Especially the duration of life will be reduced. There are prediction in the //śāstras.// In this age the duration of life, people's sentiment for becoming merciful, brain substance, in so many ways they are being reduced. They are not so powerful. So the duration of age is very small. We are always disturbed, and practically we have no knowledge about spiritual science. For example, that in this university... Not only in this university---there are hundreds and thousands of universities all over the world---there is no department of knowledge where the science of the soul is taught.

Actually, we are all spirit souls. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// we understand,

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
> tathā dehāntara-prāptir
> dhīras tatra na muhyati
> [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]

We are transmigrating from one body to another, exactly like in our present life. Just like all of us present here, we had a body, a small baby body. Where is that body? That body is gone. So far I am an old man. I remember that I was a small baby. I still remember when I was about six months old I was lying down on the lap of my eldest sister, and she was knitting, and I was lying down and playing. I remember. So it is possible for everyone to remember that "I had a small body, then that I had a boy's body, then I had a youthful body. Now I am in this body." So where are those bodies? The body's now gone. It is a different body. That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. Similarly, when I give up this body, then I'll have to accept another body.

It is very simple to understand. As I have changed so many bodies, not only childhood, babyhood, boyhood, youthhood. According to medical science we are changing body every second imperceptibly. So this process, that the soul is permanent... Just like I remember my babyhood body or childhood body. I am the same person, soul, but I have changed so many bodies. Similarly, when ultimately I shall change this body, I shall have to accept another body. This simple formula is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Everyone can think on it. And there must be some scientific research. Recently I got one letter from a doctor in Toronto. He suggested there is body..., there is soul. I had some correspondence with him. Actually this is a fact. The soul is there. There are so many proofs. Not only in the Vedic literature, but even ordinary experience. The soul is there, and the soul is transmigrating from one body to another. This is going on, but unfortunately there is no serious study on the subject matter or department of knowledge in the universities. This is not very good.

Actually, this human form of life is meant for researching this: //athāto brahma jijñāsā.// The //Vedānta-sūtra// says. This human form of life is meant for searching out about Brahman, or the spirit, Absolute Truth. So the yoga system means that //brahma-jijñāsā,// to search out the Brahman principle within this material body. Matter and spirit. So that searching out, as recommended in the //Bhagavad-gītā// by Kṛṣṇa Himself... And Arjuna said that "The system You are recommending, or the //haṭha-yoga// system, is not possible for me." But Kṛṣṇa assured him that Arjuna was the greatest of all yogis. He, I mean to say, pacified him by saying that "Don't bother because you are unable to practice //haṭha-yoga// system, you are not a yogi. You are the best yogi. You are the best yogi." Why? He gave this formula, that //yoginām api sarveṣām:// [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]] "Of all different types of yogis..." There are //haṭha-yogī, jñāna-yogī, dhyāna-yogī, bhakti-yogī,// many, //karma-yogī.// There are many yogis. But Kṛṣṇa said, "Of all the yogis, the one yogi who is constantly thinking of Me within himself..." //Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā. Mad-gata.// Kṛṣṇa says //mad-gata.// Means "simply upon Me, Kṛṣṇa." //Antar-ātmanā,// "within the heart." //Sa me yuktatamaḥ:// "He is the first-class yogi."

Now who can think of Kṛṣṇa always within himself? That is also very easy to understand. If you love somebody, then you can think of him always within yourself. Otherwise it is not possible. If you love somebody, then naturally you'll think of him always. That is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā://

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.38]

//Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena.// One who has developed love of God, or Kṛṣṇa... When I speak of Kṛṣṇa, you should understand "God." //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena// [Bs. 5.38]. Another name of Kṛṣṇa is Śyāmasundara. He is blackish like the cloud, but very beautiful; therefore His name is Śyāmasundara. So in this verse of //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is said that the //santaḥ,// saintly person, who has developed love for Śyāmasundara, Kṛṣṇa... //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva// [Bs. 5.38]. //Sadaiva// means always, constantly. //Santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu. Hṛdayeṣu// means within the heart. Actually, when one comes to the point of //samādhi// in yoga system, he thinks of Viṣṇu form of the Lord within the heart without any stopping. That is called //samādhi.// He is absorbed in the thought of Viṣṇu within the heart.

So Kṛṣṇa, Śyāmasundara, is the original Viṣṇu. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. //Sarvasya// means including Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara. Everyone. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ.// So He is the original Viṣṇu. According to //śāstra,// Vedic literature, He is original Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa, then His first expansion is Baladeva. Baladeva expansion: Saṅkarṣaṇa. Saṅkarṣaṇa expansion: Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa expansion: Viṣṇu, Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī, Kṣīrodakaśāyī. These are statements. So Kṛṣṇa is the original Viṣṇu, Śyāmasundara.

So this is the perfect system. //Mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā.// "Anyone who is thinking of Kṛṣṇa always within himself, he is first-class yogi." If you want perfection in yoga system, don't be satisfied only by practicing a course of //āsana.// You have to go further. Actually, the perfection of yoga system means when you are in //samādhi,// always thinking of the Viṣṇu form of the Lord within your heart, without being disturbed. Therefore the yogis go in a secluded place, and in //samādhi// they... Controlling all the senses and the mind. You have to control the mind, control the senses, and concentrate everything on the form of Viṣṇu. That is called perfection of yoga. And after that, there are other //siddhis, aṣṭa-siddhi-aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti.//

So actually this yoga system is very, very difficult. It may be possible by some solitary man, but for the general mass of people it is not possible. The general mass of people, that is recommended in the //śāstra// that

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

There is no other alternative. //Nāsty eva, nāsty eva.// There is no other alternative, no other alternative, no other alternative. Three times. Three times means yoga, //jñāna,// and //arcana.// Yoga system as it was recommended in the //Satya-yuga, kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇum,// that is yoga---always in meditation of Viṣṇu. That is called yoga. //Kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ// [SB 12.3.52]. And in the Tretā-yuga, by performing great sacrifices, //yajñas.// And in the Dvāpara-yuga, by temple worship. //Kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt:// in the Kali-yuga, this age...

The present age is called Kali-yuga. Kali-yuga means the age of quarrel and disagreement. Nobody agrees with any other man. Everyone has got his own theory; everyone has got his own philosophy. So therefore it is called Kali-yuga. And if I don't agree with you, you fight with me. Therefore it is called Kali-yuga. So this is the only method recommended in this age: //kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt.// Simply by chanting the holy name of God, one can attain perfect self-realization, which was attained by the yoga system in the Satya-yuga, which was attained in the Tretā-yuga by performing great sacrifices, and which was performed in the Dvāpara-yuga by large-scale temple worship. That thing can be attained by the simple method //hari-kīrtanāt. Hari// means the Supreme Personality of Godhead; //kīrtanāt//---by glorifying Him. This is the method recommended in the //śāstras.// And Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, five hundred years ago, He appeared in a town which is known as Navadvīpa. It is about sixty miles northern side of Calcutta. People still go there. We have got our temple, center there. It is also a sacred pilgrimage. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared there, and He started this //saṅkīrtana// movement, mass //saṅkīrtana// movement, without any discrimination. And He predicted that this //saṅkīrtana// movement would be spread all over the world and the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// would be chanted in every village, town on the surface of the globe.

So in pursuance of the order of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, following His footsteps, we are trying to introduce this //saṅkīrtana// movement, Hare Kṛṣṇa, and it is coming out very successful. Everywhere. I am especially preaching in the foreign countries. All over Europe, America, Japan, Canada, Australia, I am traveling. Malaysia. And anywhere I have introduced this //saṅkīrtana// movement---we have got different centers, about sixty centers---they have been received with great pleasure. Just like you saw these boys and girls. I have not imported them from India, but they have taken this movement very seriously, and they will take it, because it appeals to the soul directly. We have got different status of our life. Bodily concept of life, mental concept of life, intellectual concept of life and spiritual concept of life. So actually we are concerned with the spiritual concept of life, //athāto brahma jijñāsā.// If you are allured by the bodily concept of life, then we are no better than these dogs and..., cats and dogs. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13]. If we accept that "I am this body," then we are no better than the cats and dogs, because their concept of life is like that.

When we understand that "I am not this body...," As Kṛṣṇa wanted to impress upon Arjuna in the beginning of His teaching of //Bhagavad-gītā:// "First of all try to understand what you are. Why you are lamenting in the bodily concept of life? You have to fight. Certainly you have to fight with your brothers and brother-in-laws and nephews, other side. And you are lamenting. But first of all understand whether you are body or not." That is the beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā.// He tried to make him understood that you are not body. So these instructions were not for Arjuna. For everyone. We have to first of all learn that "I am not this body. I am spirit soul." //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// That is Vedic instruction. And as soon as you come to this point, if you are firmly convinced that you are not this body, that is called //brahma-bhūta// [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]] stage, Brahman realization stage. That is knowledge, real knowledge. Knowledge, advancement of knowledge for eating, sleeping, mating, that is animal knowledge. The animals also, the dog also knows how to eat, how to sleep, how to mate and how to defend. So if our education is only on these points... The dog is eating according to his nature, but we are also eating in a nice plate, nicely cooked food in a nice table, but the principle is eating. That is not advancement, that "I am eating in a better plate in a better place than the dog; therefore I am advanced." But you are eating, that's all. Similarly sleeping. You may sleep in a very nice apartment, six story building or 102nd story building; a dog is lying on the street. But when he sleeps and when you sleep, there is no difference. You cannot know whether you are sleeping in a skyscraper building or on the ground, because you are dreaming something else which has taken you from your bed. You have forgotten that "My body is lying there on the bed, and now I am flying in the air," dreaming. So this sleeping method, if you improve, that is not advancement of civilization. Similarly mating. The dog has no social custom. Whenever there is another she-dog, he mates on the street, and you may do very silent in a secret place, but the mating is there. But people are learning how to mate like dog. So in this way defending. A dog has also his defending measures. He has got teeth and nails. He can defend himself. And you might have atom bombs. But the measure is defending. That's all.

Therefore //śāstra// says that human life is not meant only for these four principles of life, bodily demands. There is another thing. That another thing is //brahma-jijñāsā. Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// A human being should be inquisitive to learn what is Absolute Truth. So that education is lacking. Therefore without this //brahma-jijñāsā// education, //brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.// According to Vedic civilization, a //brāhmaṇa// is learned. //Paṇḍita.// A //brāhmaṇa// is called //paṇḍita// because //brāhmaṇa// means one who knows Brahman. //Brahma jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.// Therefore he is called //paṇḍita.// In India the //brāhmaṇa// is addressed as //paṇḍita. Paṇḍita// means a //brāhmaṇa// is expected to know Brahman; therefore he is //brāhmaṇa.// Not by birth. //Brahma jānāti. Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ.// By birth everyone is //śūdra,// fourth-class man. //Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ.// And when he's reformed by the purificatory process...

There are //daśa-vidha-saṁskāra,// ten kinds of purificatory process. When one undergoes all these processes and at last comes to the spiritual master who gives him sacred thread as recognition of his second birth... //Dvija. Dvija// means second birth. One birth by the father and mother, and the other birth is by the spiritual master and Vedic knowledge. That is called second birth. //Saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ.// At that time he is given chance to study and understand what is //Vedas. Veda-pāṭhād bhaved vipraḥ.// By studying very nicely all the //Vedas,// one becomes //vipra.// Then, when he actually realizes what is Brahman and his relationship with Him, then he becomes a brāhmaṇa. And above that situation, when from Brahman understanding, impersonal Brahman understanding, he comes to the platform of understanding Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he becomes a Vaiṣṇava. This is the process. That is the perfectional process. Kṛṣṇa therefore says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ.// "Anyone who knows Me in truth," what happens to him? //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti:// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]] "Such persons, after giving up this body, do not come back again in this material world to accept a material body." Then what happens to him? //Mām eti:// "He comes to Me, back to home, back to Godhead."

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is directly giving people how to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ. Tattvataḥ,// in truth. So we are giving Kṛṣṇa knowledge based on this authorized scripture, //Bhagavad-gītā, Vedas. Vedas// means knowledge. And what is the... Vedānta means the ultimate end of knowledge. What is that end of knowledge? That is Kṛṣṇa. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. By all the //Vedas,// the ultimate conclusion should be Kṛṣṇa. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. This conclusion comes after many, many births. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān.// After culturing knowledge for many, many births, when actually one becomes wise, then //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate,// he surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa. How he surrenders? Because he knows, //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti:// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]] Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa is everything. Whatever we see, it is simply a manifestation of the energy of Vāsudeva. One must be convinced on this fact, and then he becomes a devotee. //Prapadyate.// Kṛṣṇa therefore advises that you understand or not understand, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]] "Simply surrender unto Me."

So what Kṛṣṇa taught in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// we are teaching the same thing without any different manufactured ideas. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And it is open to everyone. The process is very simple. We have got our center here. If you want to take advantage of this movement, you are welcome. You'll be happy.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [applause]
