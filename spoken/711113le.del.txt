====== Pandal Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for your kindly coming here and participating in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So I may inform our friends that His Excellency Mr. Jain is a devotee of Lord Rāmacandra. I was talking with him. So we are so pleased that you are associating with devotees.

> 'sādhu-saṅga', 'sādhu-saṅga'-sarva-śāstre kaya
> lava-mātra sādhu saṅge sarva siddhi haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:54|[Cc. Madhya 22.54]]]

The human life is meant for composing an association where devotees may take part, //sādhu-saṅga.// In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, //mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimuktes// [[books:sb:5:5:2|[SB 5.5.2]]]. //Mahat-seva. Mahat// means whose mind has been broadened, not crippled. Cripple-minded man thinks in terms of personal interest or society's interest or community's interest, nation's interest, or international interest. Even international interest is cripple-minded, because there are many planets. If we expand ourself from self-interest to family interest, from family interest to community interest, similarly, even you expand to the international interest, it is imperfect unless your interest is expanded up to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the Vedic injunction in the //Ṛg Veda, oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ.// Those who are advanced in knowledge, their aim is, their interest is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Viṣṇu. //Tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padam.// But people do not know what is his self-interest. That is indicated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇu.// Everyone should be self-interest. But in this material world, being illusioned, being bewildered by the material energy, we are thinking our self-interest in terms of our particular type of education. Somebody is thinking that "Simply I have to maintain my body somehow or other." Little expanded, thinking interest of society, you go on. But they do not know that the self-interest must expand to Lord Viṣṇu. And that is explained by Prahlāda Mahārāja.

We are discussing this verse, that

> yathā hi puruṣasya iha
> viṣṇoḥ pādopasarpaṇam
> yad eṣa sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> priya ātmeśvaraḥ suhṛt

//Priya ātmeśvaraḥ suhṛt, viṣṇoḥ, viṣṇoḥ pādopasarpaṇam.// Our self-interest must reach up to the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu. That is perfection. Otherwise whatever interest we create, that is temporary interest and it will be finished and I shall create another interest. That knowledge is lacking in the modern civilization. We are interested in nationalism. That is very good. But we do not know what nationalism was in my past life and what nationalism will be there in my next life. That we do not. Therefore, Prahlāda Mahārāja says that interest should be to the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu as it is indicated, directed by the //Vedas, tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padam.// Unfortunately, somehow or other we have forgotten that interest. That is explained by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //anādi bahir-mukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela ataeva māyā tāra golay badhila//[?]. We do not know when we have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, our self-interest. And because we have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, therefore //māyā,// the illusory energy of Kṛṣṇa, has caught up us. //Ataeva māyā tāra golay badhila//[?].

So you are existing in this conditioned state of life fully under the control of //māyā. Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā,// that is stated in the //Śrīmad... Bhagavad-gītā. Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe.//

> īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati 
> bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
> yantrārūḍhāni māyayā
> [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]

Just try to understand. We are given a kind of machine, //yantra,// this body, a particular type of machine. Actually it is machine. It is a physiological machine. But the machine has developed by //māyā prakṛti// because I wanted it. //Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā. Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati. Īśvaraḥ,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramātmā feature, //antaryāmī,// He is situated in everyone's heart---in my heart, in dog's heart, in demigod's heart, everyone. Not only in the heart of the living entity, but He is within the atom. That information we get from the //Brahma-saṁhitā,//

> eko 'py asau racayituṁ jagad-aṇḍa-koṭiṁ
> yac chaktir asti jagad-aṇḍa-cayā yad-antaḥ
> aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.35]

//Eko 'py asau racayitum.// One partial expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa, Govinda. The prime factor is Govinda. So in order to create this material world, He has expanded Himself by His one portion, which is known as Viṣṇu-tattva, Mahā-Viṣṇu. The Mahā-Viṣṇu is described,

> yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya
> jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ
> viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣo
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.48]

We are getting this information from Lord Brahmā, the creator of this particular universe, very authoritative statement by his realization. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in the beginning, the description of the Lord is given, //janmādy asya yataḥ, tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. So, first of all He gave instruction, the Lord, //janmādy asya yataḥ,// from whom everything is emanating. Lord Brahmā is also emanating from Him. //Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye.// So how Lord Brahmā got Vedic instruction? That is answered, //hṛdā. Hṛdā// means through the heart. So the Lord is situated in everyone's heart---in the heart of the Brahmā or in the heart of the ant. Not only in the heart but also within the atom. //Aṇḍāntara-sthaṁ paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham. Paramāṇu// means atom. So we do not know how many //paramāṇus,// atoms, are there. That is impossible to count. Even if you are able to count how many //paramāṇus// or atoms are there, still you cannot know what is the limit of God's expansions and qualities. So that God, Kṛṣṇa, is Vāsudeva, all-expansive. So He is sitting in everyone's heart and He is giving opportunity, everyone, whatever he wants to do. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. He is situated there, and He is so kind that the living entity, whatever he is wanting, the Lord is giving him. So this body is also given by God. It is made by the material nature, but it is given by God. //Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni.// Just like we take a vehicle and travel. Similarly, we are wanting to do something, it doesn't matter what, and Kṛṣṇa as Supersoul, who is sitting within my heart, He is asking this material nature that "You give him such-and-such body so that he can enjoy whatever he likes." So therefore we are getting different types of body, and there are 8,400,000 species of life.

So this body, if you like, you can get the body of a human being, or you can get the body of a tiger, or you can get the body of demigod, or you can get the body of Lord Brahmā, or you can get the body of the microbic germ in the stool. This will depend on your work. This is going on. There are innumerable planets, there are innumerable universes, and the living entities are all innumerable, and they are getting innumerable types of bodies, and every account is kept. Now just imagine what is the government of Kṛṣṇa. And this is being managed, //ekāṁśena sthito jagat// [[books:bg:10:42|[Bg. 10.42]]]. This whole worldly affair is being managed by one Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. This information we get from the //śāstras.//

So our position at the present moment is we are desiring something. We know, every one of us know we have got different desires. Not that everyone has got the same desire. Why you have got different desires? And that different desires means different consciousness. That is also described in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> vyavasāyātmikā buddhir
> ekeha kuru-nandana
> bahu-śākhā hy anantāś ca
> buddhayo 'vyavasāyinām
> [[books:bg:2:41|[Bg. 2.41]]]

Those who are not fixed up, they have got different desires. And because they have got different desires, they are getting different types of body. And because they are getting different types of body, they are rolling on, wandering in different situation, in different planets. But one who has come to the right conclusion of life, he is called //vyavasāyātmikā buddhir eka. Eka// means that Lord Viṣṇu. When our desire will becomes fixed up in Lord Viṣṇu, then our life is perfect. But that we do not know. Therefore, //bahu-śākhā anantāś ca buddhi avyavasāyinām.// Because our mind, because our desire, is not fixed up in Lord Viṣṇu, we are manufacturing different desires, because mind's business is concoction, accepting something, rejecting something. This is going on. But by intelligence we come to a certain conclusion. So one who is above the activities of the mind, //manaso parā buddhi,// one who has learned how to use his intelligence, that art is called //buddhi-yogam.// Yoga on the platform of intelligence. First of all in the beginning, our platform is sensuous. //Indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur// [[books:bg:3:42|[Bg. 3.42]]]. Material life means sensuous life. But those who are little above, they are on the mental platform---poetry, philosophy, mental speculation. Above this there is intelligence. That intellectual life required. That means we have to transcend the position of the sensuous life, we have to transcend the position of concocted mental speculation, we have to come to the intellectual platform. That intellectual platform is called //brahma-jijñāsā. Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// Just like Sanātana Gosvāmī, when he approached Lord Caitanya, he very intellectually asked Lord Caitanya, //'ke āmi' kene more jāpe tāpa-traya:// "Who am I? Why I am suffering these three kinds of material miserable condition of life?" This is intellectual platform. This is intellectual path. And when we exercise this intellectual path of our life, that is called //buddhi-yogam. Buddhi-yogam.// Therefore, in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said, //kṛṣṇa ye bhaje se baḍa catura.// The most intellectual person can become Kṛṣṇa conscious, not ordinary man. Why? Kṛṣṇa also confirms this in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> bahūnāṁ janmanām ante
> jñānavān māṁ prapadyate
> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti
> sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ
> [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]

He is most intellectual, //mahātmā,// whose intelligence has been broadened so that he has understood Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, as everything. //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ.// Very rare.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, although it appears to be very easy, but it is actually it is very difficult. But by the mercy of Lord Caitanya, it has been made easy. Otherwise it is not very easy. It is made easy in this way, that Kṛṣṇa says,

> bahūnāṁ janmanām ant
> jñānavān māṁ prapadyate
> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti
> sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ

//Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. The thing which is achieved after many, many births of intellectual activities, Lord Caitanya says, "Now this is the point. You catch up this." Kṛṣṇa also says, "You catch up this. Why should you wait for many, many births?" If it is a fact that after many, many births of intellectual exercises you have come to the point of surrendering unto Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa says the most confidential part of knowledge is that "You surrender immediately unto Me."

So those who are actually intelligent, they take this opportunity and surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa. It is very easy if one accepts easily, but it is very difficult if one does not accept it easily. Otherwise it is very easy. Kṛṣṇa is canvassing that "You surrender unto Me." //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. That is Kṛṣṇa is giving us the intelligence, //buddhi-yogam.// And if you surrender, then Kṛṣṇa says, assures,

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te
> [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]

//Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām. Satata// means twenty-four hours. Not that I meditate for fifteen minutes and do all nonsense twenty-four hours. No. //Satata-yuktānām.// One should be engaged twenty-four hours in the business of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is possible. It is not that it is impossible. You can engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness twenty-four hours without any cessation, but you have to know how to do it. That is being taught in //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// But you can do it. And as soon as you take to it, //teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. Kṛṣṇa should be worshiped with //prīti,// love, not officially. Of course, in the beginning, we have to be officially. In the beginning, we have to act by the direction of the spiritual master, by the direction of the //śāstras.// But when you practice it by the direction of guru and //śāstra, sādhu guru śāstra vā,// then gradually you become attached to it.

As I have explained several times, this attachment stage can be achieved under certain process. As //Bhagavad-gītā,// Bhagavān, says,

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

Kṛṣṇa is teaching how you can develop your attachment for Kṛṣṇa in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// We have to take it. We have to understand it. So as soon as we develop this attachment, //teṣāṁ satata-yuk...// Attachment means just like you have got a lover or something lovable object; you cannot live without it. You are always searching, "Where is my lovable object? Where is my..." That is called attachment. That attachment as taught by Lord Caitanya, He says, //śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.// This is the final stage of attachment. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching us that "I am feeling everything vacant." Why? "Being separated from Govinda." //Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.// This is the highest stage of attachment. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching people how to become attached to Kṛṣṇa instead of //māyā.// We are attached to //māyā.// We have created so many things just arrangement for forgetting Kṛṣṇa. Anything we make here for sense enjoyment... [end]
