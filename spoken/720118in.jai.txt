====== Sannyāsa Initiation of Tamal Kṛṣṇa ======

**Devotee:**
Evening, January 18th, Jaipur.

**Prabhupāda:**
[recites with Tamal Kṛṣṇa and devotees repeating]

//parātma, niṣṭhā, adhyā, sitāṁ, pūrva, tamair, mahadbhiḥ; ahaṁ, tariṣyāmi, duranta, pāraṁ, tamo, mukunda, aṅghri, niṣe, vayaiva. etāṁ, sam āsthāya, parātma, niṣṭhām, adhyāsitāṁ, pūrva, tamair, mahadbhiḥ; ahaṁ, tariṣyāmi, duranta, pāraṁ, tamo, mukundāṅghri, niṣe, vayaiva. etāṁ, sam āsthāya, parātma, niṣṭhām, adhyāsitāṁ, pūrva, tamair, mahadbhiḥ, ahaṁ, tariṣyāmi, duranta, pāraṁ, mukunda, aṅghri, niṣe, vayaiva.//

The meaning of this verse is that I am just now following the footsteps of previous //ācāryas.// To accept //sannyāsa// so that I can completely devote myself in the service of Mukunda. Mukunda means one who can give liberation. //Mukti muk// means //mukti// liberation. So Kṛṣṇa’s name is Mukunda. He can give actually liberation otherwise there is no question of liberation.

To accept the [indistinct].This //mantra// was previously chanted by Lord Caitanya when He took //sannyāsa.// Therefore we Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava’s when we accept //sannyāsa// we follow the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The narration is in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu when he completed his twenty fourth year of age, //cabbiśa vatsara-śeṣa yei māgha-māsa// [[books:cc:madhya:3:3|[Cc. Madhya 3.3]]]. That month, month was also the same, //māgha-māsa// this month is going now. When He completed his 24th year on the month of //māgha// this January and February. In that //śukla-pakṣe// in the moonlight He accepted //sannyāsa.// So after accepting //sannyāsa, sannyāsa kari’ premāveśe calilā vṛndāvana.// After accepting //sannyāsa// He immediately left his country and went towards Vṛndāvana.

Vṛndāvana means where Lord Kṛṣṇa lives. Lord Kṛṣṇa lives everywhere but His specific place is Vṛndāvana. So anyone who is engaged in the service of the Lord anywhere he goes that is Vṛndāvana, //rāḍha-deśe tina dina karilā bhramaṇa// [[books:cc:madhya:3:4|[Cc. Madhya 3.4]]]. But He travelled for three days in Bengal, //rāḍha-deśe. Rāḍha-deśe// means where the Ganges river is not flowing. That is called //rāḍha-deśe.//

> ei śloka paḍi’ prabhu bhāvera āveśe
> bhramite pavitra kaila saba rāḍha-deśe
> [[books:cc:madhya:3:5|[Cc. Madhya 3.5]]]

So where ever He was travelling He was reciting this verse;

> etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām
> adhyāsitāṁ pūrvatamair mahadbhiḥ
> ahaṁ tariṣyāmi duranta-pāraṁ
> tamo mukundāṅghri-niṣevayaiva
> [SB 11.23.57]

So you get this //śloka// in your heart and where ever you go you chant this //mantra// and remember Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted that He save;

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu He, He was a very high class educated //brāhmaṇa// very beautiful to look at. He had his young wife sixteen years old, His affectionate mother but He left everything for preaching this Kṛṣṇa Consciousness movement all over the world. Therefore those who follow strictly the footsteps of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu he will be blessed by Him. It was the duty of the Indians because He said, //bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra’.//

Anyone who has taken his birth as human being in the land of Bhārata-varṣa. //Janma sārthaka kari’ kara para-upakāra,// so it was the duty of the Indians to take such //sannyāsa// and preach the cult of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu all over the world. Unfortunately they are packed up in a limited space. I am so much obliged to you. That you American boys you are taking //sannyāsa// and preaching the cult of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu all over the world. Thank you very much. [end]
