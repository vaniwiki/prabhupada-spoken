====== Bhagavad-gītā 9.4–6 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]

This verse, we have been discussing last night, this is distinct explanation of impersonalism and personalism. Actually, there cannot be any impersonal idea. Here Kṛṣṇa says, //avyakta-mūrtinā.// Even //avyakta,// nonmanifested, it has also a //mūrti,// a form. Generally, we conceive impersonalism, voidism, voidism, compared with the sky. Sky is called zero, void, but sky has also a form. We see daily, a big, round form. So there cannot be anything without form. That is not possible.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa particularly says //avyakta-mūrtinā.// Although it is nonmanifested, but it has got a form. But one who does not take to the real form and takes to the imaginary form, that has been explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā, kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām// [[books:bg:12:5|[Bg. 12.5]]]. Those who are attached to the impersonal form, they unnecessarily take some trouble always, //kleśaḥ adhika-taraḥ.//

Of course, to understand the form of the Lord, that is not very easy thing. It requires much intelligence. Intelligence, that is also a kind of //tapasya.// Without //tapasya,// nobody can understand the form of the Lord, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1]. Because generally we take it for granted "form" means a form like me. Kṛṣṇa says that //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati, tad aham aśnāmi// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. Now, we offer eatables to the Lord. Kṛṣṇa says //tad aham aśnāmi,// "I eat." But the atheists cannot see. They cannot see that how Kṛṣṇa is eating. They say that "You offered something to Kṛṣṇa, but He has not eaten. It is lying there; you are eating." But no, Kṛṣṇa has eaten. They do not know how they eat..., how Kṛṣṇa eats. That is their fault. Poor fund of knowledge.

One has to learn how Kṛṣṇa can eat. Kṛṣṇa can eat simply by seeing. Simply, Kṛṣṇa's all parts, all the //indriyas,// different parts of the body, limbs, they're as good as Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa can eat, just like we eat through our mouth, but Kṛṣṇa can eat with His eyes. That is absolute. We have, because we are not absolute, we have got distinction between my our eyes and our hands, our mouth. There are distinction, which is called //sagata viveḥ.//

We have got difference of body between yourself and myself, and in the body also there are differences. My eyes are different from my hands, my hands are different from my legs. But Kṛṣṇa, being Absolute, He has no such distinction. That they do not understand. Therefore they cannot imagine how God, Kṛṣṇa, can have a form. "If He has a form, then the form is like this, our," the Māyāvādīs, they say. They believe that when Brahman comes, He accepts a material body.

That is defied by Kṛṣṇa: //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]], "Because I come as a human being, these rascals take Me as one of the human being." This is the beginning. //Mūḍhā,// this word is used, very word. //Mūḍhā// means rascal. Because Kṛṣṇa comes as this child of Yaśodā-mā or as the son of Vāsudeva, therefore these Māyāvādīs, they mistake that Kṛṣṇa or Brahman has taken the form, accepting the body from //māyā.// But that's not the fact. Kṛṣṇa is not under //māyā.// Kṛṣṇa says, //sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā:// not accepting this material energy. He's ordering, //sambhavāmi yuge yuge, sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā// [[books:bg:4:6|[Bg. 4.6]]].

So the so-called rascal scholars, they think Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's body are different. As we, we spirit soul, we are different from this body, similarly these Māyāvādīs, they also think that Kṛṣṇa is different from His body. We have several times discussed, a big scholar, when Kṛṣṇa says in this Ninth Chapter //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], he translates nice, but comments that "It is not to Kṛṣṇa, the person. It is unto the Supreme Brahman who is within Kṛṣṇa." He does not know Kṛṣṇa, that Kṛṣṇa has no such difference. He is Para-brahman. He has no difference as between the soul and the body. He is complete spiritual body, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1]. Kṛṣṇa is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha, sac-cid-ānanda.// So there cannot be any difference between Kṛṣṇa and His soul. There is no such thing.

But these people, the so-called scholars, they do not understand Kṛṣṇa, but they have the audacity to write comments on //Bhagavad-gītā.// They do not know what is Kṛṣṇa, but they have the impudency to write comments on //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa says, "It is meant for you, Arjuna, because you are My devotee," //bhakto 'si, priyo 'si me// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]. Nobody can understand //Bhagavad-gītā// unless one is very dear to Kṛṣṇa and //bhakta// of Kṛṣṇa. Nobody can understand. That is the first step.

One must be very dear to Kṛṣṇa and one must be a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, then he can touch //Bhagavad-gītā.// Of course, there are so many things, //jñāna-yoga, bhakti-yoga, dhyāna-yoga, haṭha-yoga, karma-yoga.// So many //yogas// are there. But Kṛṣṇa says, "The most confidential part of knowledge, My dear Arjuna, I am giving you, because you are so My dear friend," //sarva guhyatamam,// the Eighteenth Chapter, that, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namas...//

So God, Kṛṣṇa, is not imperson at the ultimate end. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases: Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. So Paramātmā is subordinate to the Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa, and Brahman is also subordinate to the Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa. //Brahmaṇo ahaṁ pratiṣṭhā.// Brahman, the impersonal Brahman feature, //brahma-jyotir,// that is resting on Kṛṣṇa. It is very easy to understand. We can see that the sunshine is resting on the sun globe. Sun globe is localized, but sunshine is very big. It is distributed all over the universe. But that does not mean that sunshine is more important than the sun globe. The sun globe is important, and the still more important is the sun-god. Within the sun globe there is sun-god, Vivasvān. He is a person. And there is also other living entities, their, all their bodies are made of fire.

Here in the material science, they sterilize. They, they are under the impression that when there is too strong temperature, the microbes die, or when there is too cold, the microbes die. There are two kinds of sterilization: either by increasing the heat or decreasing the heat, below zero. But //Bhagavad-gītā,// from //Bhagavad-gītā// we understand, //adāhyo 'yam:// soul is never killed in fire, neither it is killed by extreme coldness. //Nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam.// Spirit cannot be counteracted by any material reaction. That is spirit.

So therefore, the theory that in the fire the living entity dies, it is not; otherwise how these //ślokas// are there in the Second Chapter? //Adāhyo 'yam, akledyo 'yam, aśoṣya 'yam// [[books:bg:2:24|[Bg. 2.24]]]. That means anything material, that can be cut into pieces, but the soul cannot be cut into pieces. //Acchedyo 'yam.// It cannot be cut into pieces. //Acchedyo' yam. Adāhyo 'yam:// it cannot be burned into ashes in the fire.

//Akledyo 'yam aśoṣya 'yam:// by the reaction of the five elements, earth, water, fire, air, that is not applicable in the soul. So if they're not applicable to the soul, which is minute particle of the Supreme Soul, how it is applicable to the Supreme Soul? Therefore it is a miscalculation that Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Soul, is affected by this material nature. That is not possible. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that //sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā// [[books:bg:4:6|[Bg. 4.6]]].

Besides that, Kṛṣṇa says that material nature works under His direction, //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. There are other evidences. In //Brahmā-saṁhitā://

> sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā
> chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā
> icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā...
> [Bs. 5.44]

//Sa durgā, icchānurūpam. Yasya icchānurūpam api ceṣṭate. Sa durgā. Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktiḥ.// Durgā is so powerful that it can create..., she can create, she maintains and she can annihilate everything; still, she is working as maidservant under the direction of Govinda. //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// And it is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]].

So Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything.

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]

//Vasudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. One who understands Kṛṣṇa perfectly... We cannot understand Kṛṣṇa perfectly; that is not possible. But as far as our knowledge is concerned, as far as we can study //Vedas,// if we simply can understand that Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything, //īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ...// [Bs. 5.1] //Paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ.// Every one of us, somehow or other, we are //īśvaraḥ. Īśvaraḥ// means controller. So we have got some controlling capacity, according to our capacity, but we are not the supreme controller. That is not possible.

Supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa. You may be controller. I am controller, but above me there is another controller, above him there is another controller, above him there is another controller. In this way, within this material world, the supreme controller is Brahmā---within this material world, not beyond this material world. Only on the..., on this universe, in each and every universe, there are many Brahmās, many Rudras, and many other demigods---many suns, many moons, many, many, millions.

> yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-
> koṭiṣv [aśeṣa]-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam
> tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.40]

So everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy; therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.1] means Kṛṣṇa's energy is spread everywhere, everything. //Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ.//

That expansion, in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa// it is said,

> eka-sthāni [deśa]-sthitasyāgner
> jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā
> parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktis
> sarvaiva [tathedam] akhilaṁ jagat
> [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 1.22.52]

//Sarvedam akhilaṁ jagat. Idaṁ sarvam.// Whatever we are seeing, they are simply expansion of Kṛṣṇa's energy. Just like a big merchant, a big industrialist, he has got big, big factories. So these factories, he..., one can say that this is Mr. Birla's factory or Mr. such-and-such gentleman's factory, Tata's factory. But still, although the factory belongs to Tata, the factory is running on by the energy of Tata, but you cannot find, if you want to see where is Tata here, Mr. Tata, that you cannot see. Tata is seeing..., sitting in his room and is pulling button and everything is going on.

Similarly, //goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto// [Bs. 5.37]. Kṛṣṇa in His place, He is with Rādhārāṇī. He is enjoying playing on His flute. Why He has to do anything? //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya 13.65,// purport]. This is Vedic injunction. //Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate.// He has nothing to do. If we can see ordinary, a Mr. Tata or Mr. Birla, has nothing to do, everything is being done by his energy, so how great energy has got the Supreme Personality of Godhead, just we can imagine.

So His energy is acting, working. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.// His energy is acting in such a perfect way that as we see that it is automatically working. Automatically. An electronic machine, just by putting here a button, it is immediately responding five thousand miles away, the same button working. That..., this scientific method we have discovered. And we have discovered. The law is there. You have simply learned to push one button, but there are //vividhaiva// button.

//Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.// So simply by His willing, everything is being done. That is Kṛṣṇa. Simply by His willing. //Vicamati.// Just like in the Bible it is said, "Let there be creation, and there was creation." Simply by this will, "Let there be creation," there is creation. But there is action of the energy of Kṛṣṇa, but the energy is so subtle that immediately it performs: //svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.//

You see, study one flower, how finely it is constructed, how... The botanist can study that it is running in this way, the veins are running in this way, the system is like this. But who has made the system, that is to be studied, not only simply studying the superficial nature. A flower is coming out. It is not coming automatically. Exactly the same energy. Just like if we want to paint one flower, we have to apply our energy.

We have to collect a color and the brush and apply our attention. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is doing, but His energy is so perfect, it becomes quickly done, immediately. Immediately. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate.// The same example: Just like now in the electronic days. Formerly we have to connect so many things before doing telegraphic transfer, but by electronic, immediately, simply by pushing one button.

So if in the material world such subtle things can be performed, so spiritually, still fine, finely it can be done. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that "Whatever you see," //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]], "it is My expansion of energy." "It is My expansion of energy." The same example as it is given in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa,// just as a fire is there in one place. The another example is just like sunshine. Sun is fixed up. You can see, everyone can see that it is lying, stationed, in one insignificant corner of the sky, but his sunshine is distributed all over the universe, and everything, all planets, all vegetation, all seasonal changes, they are depending on the sunshine.

Similarly, Kṛṣṇa has got His rays of the body, //brahma-jyotir, yasya prabhā// [Bs. 5.40], //prabhā. Brahmajyoti// is described as //prabhā. Yasya prabhā prabhavato.// As soon as there is //brahma-jyotir... Brahmajyoti// is always there. //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi.// In the //brahma-jyotir,// innumerable universes are coming out, anywhere. In another place it is said, //yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vila-jā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// [Bs. 5.48]. //Jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// means Brahmā. So everything is coming from Him. But the same thing, that is the Vedic injunction. //Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante.// These are the Vedic injunction. //Yato vā imāni// [Taittirīya Upaniṣad 3.1.1], //sa aikṣata, sa asṛjata.// [Aitareya-Upaniṣad 1.1.1–2] So, //sa vai..., raso vai saḥ:// everything, all, reservoir of all //rasas.// So same, same thing is explained here, //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]].

But these Māyāvādī, they think that "I am the same. I am... I am distributed everywhere. I am moving the sun, I am moving..." They mediate like this. This is nonsense. How you are moving? It is said, //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam:// "I am expanded all over this body." That you can say. My limitation. //Kṣetra, kṣetra-jña,// that is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Idaṁ śarīraṁ kṣetram iti abhidhīyate// [[books:bg:13:1-2|[Bg. 13.2]]]. I am not exactly controller; still, suppose I am the proprietor of this body.

Actually, I am not proprietor of the body. Actually proprietor is, of this body, Kṛṣṇa, Paramātmā, but I have given a place. That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā: kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata// [[books:bg:13:3|[Bg. 13.3]]]. //Jīvātmā// is the proprietor of this body. He has been given this body to act, just like this human body is given by nature to us. Now we can act. If we act just like human being, then your life is successful; the chance given by nature is fruitful.

What is that chance? This body is given for inquiring about Brahman: //athāto brahma jijñāsā. Atha,// now we have got this human form of body. Now inquire about Brahman. Why you are going to the share market: "What is the price of this share?" But we are wasting in that way. [Hindi?] //Bās.// Not inquiring about Brahman. [Hindi?] The dogs and cats, they are all, "Where is some food? Where is some stool?" They are inquiring. Not that inquiry.

Just like the hog is inquiring whole day, "Where is stool? Where is stool?" Not, not that inquiry. The human body is meant for inquiring about Brahman: //athāto brahma jijñāsā.// This is //Vedānta-sūtra.// But they're not interested in inquiring about Brahman. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Viḍ-bhujām,// hogs, //viḍ-bhujām. Viḍ-bhujām// means stool-eater. They are working very hard. But this human body is not meant for that purpose. //Kaṣṭān kāmān. Kāmān// means the necessities to fulfill, to satisfy the senses, //āhāra nidra bhaya mithuna//---where to eat, where to sleep, where to have sexual intercourse, where..., how to defend. These are //kāmān.// These are bodily necessities. But for fulfilling simply the bodily necessities if we work so hard, then where is the difference between us and the hogs? They're doing same thing.

Therefore //śāstra// says, //nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. They are all, all the bodies, they have got, cats and dogs and hogs, they have also got body. Trees, they have got their body. But //nṛloke:// in the human society when you have got a body, it is not meant for working hard like hogs and dogs. This is human civilization. This is human civilization. Then what it is meant for? //Tapo, tapasya.// That is Vedic civilization. That is Vedic civilization. But we have made program for economic development, working hard day and night like hogs and dogs. This is going on. This is going on under the name of civilization. And to satisfy me after hard labor, there is wine and women and flesh. That's all.

This is not civilization. This is hog civilization. Real civilization is for //tapasya.// Everything, God has given us everything. You eat. For human being, Kṛṣṇa has given you nice fruits, nice flowers, nice grains, nice milk, nice sugar. Why don't you eat them nicely? That is Vedic civilization. Take the grains, take the fruits, take milk, take sugar, make varieties of preparation, offer Kṛṣṇa, and take the //prasāda// and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is civilization. This is civilization. Otherwise, simply working hard for sense gratification without any discrimination whether it is mother or sister or any..., that is hog civilization. That the hog has no discrimination you'll find.

So therefore //śāstra// says, //nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate.// They do not understand what is civilization. Here Kṛṣṇa said, now, //aprāpya māṁ nivartante mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]. But they do not know what is //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// Is there any university where this education is given, what is //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani?// Can any big philosopher can say what is this //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani?// They do not know. Kṛṣṇa said that "If you do not get Me, here is a chance, human form of body."

//Aprāpya mām.// "If you don't get Me, if you come..., do not come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then what is the result? //Nivartante, mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.//" If you do not take chance... Just like sometimes you have seen somebody takes his bird in the field and let him loose, out of the cage, and the bird goes and he also goes behind. But if the bird takes chance, "Now I am..., now let loose, let me fly away..." But that, that he does not do. He again comes within the cage, again. Again he comes. So this human form of body is just like a let loose. Now you get the freedom of flying away from this //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// But that we'll not do. We'll enter again. We'll enter. Everything is clear.

So we are not interested how to get out of the cage of //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// We are again and again coming back to the cage. This is called //ajñāna.// This is called //ajñāna. Jñāna// means that I am eternal, //na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. I do not..., I am not annihilated after the killing, after the annihilation of this body. //Nityaḥ śāśvatayam, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.// Then why I am entering this body, which is annihilated? That is the problem. That is //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// If you enter again into this material body, then again //mṛtyu.// Again enter, again die, again //mṛtyu. Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]].

This is the problem, //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// But nobody is interested how to get out of this problem. They do not know, they do not feel. They think that "After death I am annihilated." But that is not the fact. The fact is that you have to enter another body, and any material body you accept, either king's body or dog's body or hog's body or tree's body, it will be finished. It will. That is called //mṛtyu, mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.//

So we are accepting similar bodies; 8,400,000 forms of bodies are there, and one after another we are entering and leaving and entering and leaving. This is called //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// But we have no such brain that how to get out this //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani.// We can get out. That is..., that will be, that is explained, //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti.// This is //māyā. Māyā// means actually I am not under this //mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani. Ātma māyām ṛte rājan// [[books:sb:2:9:1|[SB 2.9.1]]]. It is //māyā.// Just like in dream, I enter some kind of body.

At night, every night we can experience, that when you sleep we dream that "I have taken another body. I have gone to another place. I am working in a different way, forgetting this body." This is daily experience. And when that dream is over, then again I come to this body. I remember, "Oh, I have to go there, I have to do this," another action, other activities. This is going on. I am accepting this gross dream and this subtle dream, but what is my actual position? That I do not know. This is called ignorance.

That actual position we can understand if we become Kṛṣṇa conscious. If we simply become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then we can understand our actual position. Then we can be saved, and that is stated here, //aśraddadhānāḥ puruṣā dharmasyāsya parantapa// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]. //Aśraddadhānāḥ.// If one is not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //aśraddadhānāḥ,// no faith---"I have no faith"---but it is for your interest, sir. Why you say that "I have no interest"? That is the.... //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. They, the rascal, they do not know what is his interest.

He does not know. //Bahir-artha-māninaḥ, durāśayā. Bahir-artha-māninaḥ.// He has got this material body, and he's thinking, "Satisfaction of my senses, that is my interest," //bahir-artha-māninaḥ.// And //andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās.// And another rascal leader who gives him impetus, "Yes, you do this, you do that, you will be very much satisfied. You do..." So many materialists, they engage them. That is very nice. They like to abide by such leaders. But what are those leaders? //Andhā.// They do not know what is the ultimate goal of life. They are themselves blind, and they are leading other blind followers. This is going on. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatim.//

But actually leading, actually leader is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He is actual leader. So don't follow all these nonsense things. Don't follow all these "isms"; you'll spoil your life, because you are not this body, that is the first... //Tathā dehāntaraṁ prāpti, dehino 'smin yathā dehe// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. So everything clearly explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So instead of accepting these blind leaders, we should know who is actual leader. Kṛṣṇa is the leader. We'll, if we take leadership of Kṛṣṇa, then our life is perfect; we could properly utilize the utility of human life. Otherwise we have been mislead.

Now Kṛṣṇa is therefore explaining that the, whatever you are seeing in this material world... What is this material world? This material world is combination of the spiritual and material energy of Kṛṣṇa. //Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ.// There are two different energies of Brahman. //Sarvedam akhilaṁ jagat.// What is this Calcutta city? Calcutta city means the earth, water, air, fire, sky. These are material elements, gross elements. Mind, intelligence and ego, these are the subtle elements. These eight elements, Kṛṣṇa's energy, and beyond this energy, //aparayam,// these are inferior energy. Beyond this inferior, super..., inferior energy there is a superior energy. //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]. Another superior. What is that superior energy? //Jīva-bhūta,// the living force, the living entity.

So what is this world? This world, or take this Calcutta, what is it? It is a combination of material energy and spiritual energy. The spiritual energies are the living entities. He has got this material body; therefore it is a combination. So they are working. But who is working? Actually working these living entities, and he is utilizing this material energy. This is going on. //Yayedaṁ dharyate...,// the whole world is going on like this: a combination of material energy and spiritual energy. The spiritual energy is superior and the material energy is inferior. Therefore whatever we are seeing, they are simply display, manifestation of two energies of Kṛṣṇa. //Parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ sarvedam akhilaṁ jagat.// This is //jagat.//

So although energy and the energetic, they are nondifferent, still, energy is not the energetic. This is called //acintya-bhedābheda,// simultaneously one and different. The energy is not different. Just like the fire and the heat and the light. The heat and light is from the fire. Wherever there is fire, there is heat and light, but still heat and light is not fire. Try to understand it. This is //acintya-bhedābheda.// Heat is not different from fire, light is not different from fire, but still heat and light is not fire. Similarly, the everything, whatever we see, they are simply manifestation of the two energies of God, Brahman. So they are not different from Brahman, at the same time different from Brahman. This is called //acintya-bhedābheda-tattva.//

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says here that //mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]: "Everything is resting on My energy, but I am not them." The Māyāvādī philosophers, they are mistaken, mistaking that when everything is expanded as God's energy, then why there is separate God? This is material conception. God is always separate from His energy. That is distinctly said here: //mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam.// Everything is emanation of God's energy, but still God is not there. If you worship the energy of God, that is not God-worshiping. Indirectly it is, but directly it is not.

That is explained in //Bhagavad-gītā,// the //kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ prapadyante 'nya-devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]. //Anya devatāḥ:// they are energies of Kṛṣṇa. But there is no need..., if you approach directly to the energetic, the energy is automatically touched and worshiped. //Sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā.// Just like if you pour water in the root. Root is the cause of the tree. So the tree, the, I mean, the branches, the twigs, the leaves, the flowers, everything, they are also expansion of the root. So if you water on the root, the service expands to other parts of the root.

> yathā taror mūla-niṣecanena
> tṛpyanti tat-skandha-bhujopaśākhāḥ
> prāṇopahārāc ca yathendriyāṇāṁ
> tathaiva sarvārhaṇam acyutejyā
> [[books:sb:4:31:14|[SB 4.31.14]]]

So it you simply worship Acyuta.... Acyuta means the Supreme Lord who never falls, who never falls down. We are //cyuta.// Although we are qualitatively one with God, but we have got the tendency of falldown. Therefore we have fallen down in this material world. But Kṛṣṇa does not fall down. When Kṛṣṇa comes, He is not like us. And if we consider Him as one of us, then we must be rascal number one. //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum...// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]], //paraṁ bhāvam ajananto.//

So that is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is expanding by His energy everywhere. //Sarvedam akhilaṁ jagat, parasya brahmaṇaḥ śaktiḥ.// But in the //śakti,// although there is relationship, that is also in different way indirectly Kṛṣṇa, but there is no Kṛṣṇa. That is not Kṛṣṇa. If you have... [break] //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā mat-sthani sarva-bhutani// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. Everything is resting in His energy, //mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni. Na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ:// "But I am not there." And if you, instead of Kṛṣṇa, if you worship the energy...

The material scientist, he is also worshiping Kṛṣṇa, but He is worshiping the Kṛṣṇa's material energy, not Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, if one says that "I am worshiping the energy of Kṛṣṇa, therefore there is no need of worshiping Kṛṣṇa," that is not good. That is not good. //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. If you stick to the worshipment of the energy, you'll get that success, but not as much success as Kṛṣṇa worshiping.

Therefore it is clearly said,

> mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ
> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]

In another place it is said that, just like He says that "The worshiping the other demigod, that is also worshiping Me, but //avidhi bhur bhavam.//" //Yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam:// that is not //vidhi. Vidhi// is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], to worship Kṛṣṇa. It is very simple. //Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. But people will not accept this simple thing which will give him complete perfection.

But //māyayāpahṛta-jñānā āsuri bhāvam āśritāḥ,// because they have taken the atheistic view, //āsuri bhāvam āśritāḥ,// therefore //māyā// has taken his knowledge. They..., everything is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Mayaiva vihitān hi tān// [[books:bg:7:22|[Bg. 7.22]]]. If we worship other demigod, they cannot independently offer you any benediction. Kṛṣṇa said, //mayaiva vihitān hi tān.// They have to take sanction from the Supreme Personality of Godhead before giving you the benediction. But still such benediction is temporary, //antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. They are temporary.

So such temporary benediction is meant for the //alpa-medhasā,// one whose brain substance is very small, or the brain substance, instead of brain substance, it's cow dung. They attempt, they accept in this way; otherwise every //śāstra// says, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. One..., all the Vedic literatures, they aim at understanding Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "Give up all these things. Simply surrender unto Me." It is so easy. //Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalam...// Any, any part of the world, any poor man can offer Kṛṣṇa. This is the poorest, not that who are rich, for them it is prescribed. Anyone can offer Kṛṣṇa according to his capacity. Kṛṣṇa is not hankering after your offering, but if you offer Kṛṣṇa, that is for your own interest, own benefit. //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]].

> na ca mat-sthāni bhūtāni
> paśya me yogam aiśvaram
> bhūta-bhṛn na ca bhūta-stho
> bhūtātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:5|[Bg. 9.5]]]

This is //acintya-bheda.// The same thing as I have already explained, that the heat and light is not different from the fire, but still the fire is not there. Similarly, although Kṛṣṇa is not there, but everything is there in Kṛṣṇa, and everywhere you can find Kṛṣṇa also at the same time, because everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy.

Just like here we are worshiping Deity made of stone. Everyone knows that the Deity is made of stone. That atheist class will say, "How is this? These foolish people are worshiping a stone statue." But no, that is not same stone statue. Stone is also Kṛṣṇa, because //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. So one who knows the art, by worshiping stone also, he can worship Kṛṣṇa. By worshiping stone also. It is Kṛṣṇa's mercy.

Because at the present moment, //ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. By your blunt senses, you can not understand what is Kṛṣṇa, what is Kṛṣṇa's name, what is Kṛṣṇa's form, what is Kṛṣṇa's activity. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, by His causeless mercy, has come before us in the form of stone so that we can see Him. Because we cannot see beyond stone. We cannot see beyond wood. And wood and stone is also not beyond Kṛṣṇa. That is also Kṛṣṇa.

So Kṛṣṇa has given us the facility to worship Him in the way as we can understand. It is not that Kṛṣṇa.... Kṛṣṇa is stone, because Kṛṣṇa says //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ.// He can take service from this, any form. There are eight kinds of forms. Either you paint, either you make a form from wood, from stone, from jewels, and according to Vedic system there are so many different types of Deities. So Kṛṣṇa can accept your service in any way. That is Kṛṣṇa's omnipotency. He has got omnipotency. But we can handle. If we simply, if we want to worship the gigantic //virāṭ-rūpa// of Kṛṣṇa, if you want to dress Him with cloth, where is such..., where is there such amount of cloth? How you can do it?

So it is Kṛṣṇa's kindness that He has appeared before you in a small form, so according to your capacity, you can make very nice dress, and Kṛṣṇa, you can dress Him. And by dressing Him, Kṛṣṇa will understand that "Here is my devotee. He is giving Me some service." This is the position. Therefore temple worship, the Deity worship is necessity for the //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī.// Simply if you think that "Kṛṣṇa is everywhere.

I shall think of Kṛṣṇa, meditate on Him," that is not possible. Meditation, that is also regu..., requires good qualification. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. But Kṛṣṇa, by His kindness, //arca-mūrti,// a child can see also Kṛṣṇa. Any innocent, any illiterate man can see, any man can see---a //brāhmaṇa// can see, //śūdra// can see. Therefore the Deity worship so important.

> na ca mat-sthāni bhūtāni
> paśya me yogam aiśvaram
> bhūta-bhṛn na ca bhūta-stho
> mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:5|[Bg. 9.5]]]

//Mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ:// "Everything is coming from Me; therefore everything is in Me. Still I am not there." This is called //acintya-bhedābheda.//

> yathākāśa-sthito nityaṁ
> vāyuḥ sarvatra-go mahān
> tathā sarvāṇi bhūtāni
> mat-sthānīty upadhāraya
> [[books:bg:9:6|[Bg. 9.6]]]

Just like in the sky there are so many things. //Yathākāśa. Yathākāśa-sthito nityaṁ vāyuḥ.// The //vāyuḥ, vāyuḥ// is everywhere, but it is within the sky. It is //nityo, nityam. Nityaṁ vāyuḥ sarvatra-go mahān tathā sarvāṇi bhūtāni mat-sthānī.// "Everything is in Me, and still I am not there."

So Kṛṣṇa is outside, Kṛṣṇa is inside. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. Kṛṣṇa is outside. Kṛṣṇa is inside. Kṛṣṇa is outside... //Brahmā satyaṁ jagan mithyā//---no. //Jagan// not, not //mithyā,// because these elements, //jagat// means these five elements. That is also Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa in everything. Kṛṣṇa's energy, how we can say it is //mithyā?// It is not //mithyā;// it is fact, but we do not know it is Kṛṣṇa. We are claiming, "This is our land," but we do not know it is, it is whose land. That is our mistake. Land is not //mithyā;// land is fact. But we do not know whose land, to whom this land belongs. That we do not know.

But a devotee knows that //īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]], everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa also says, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]: "I am the proprietor of all //lokas.//" But we are claiming, "This is Indian land, it is our land," "This is Chinese land," "This is American land," and you are fighting. This is due to want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Actually everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. We belong to Kṛṣṇa. My body belongs to Kṛṣṇa. I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa; therefore my only duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa. This is perfect knowledge. Otherwise all nonsense. This is the...

> yathākāśa-sthito nityaṁ
> vāyuḥ sarvatra-go mahān
> tathā sarvāṇi bhūtāni
> mat-sthānī...
> [[books:bg:9:6|[Bg. 9.6]]]

//Sarva-bhūtāni,// "Everything," //mat-sthānī,// "they are My part and parcel." Therefore the part and parcel duty is to serve the whole. Just like this finger, part and parcel of this body, its duty is to serve the whole body. When it is..., there is some defect, then it cannot serve. Then anyone, any living entity who is not engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, he is in abnormal condition of his life. That is not...

That is called conditional life. And as soon as he gives up this conditional life, he takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and begins serving Kṛṣṇa, that is //mukti.// That is //mukti. Svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ hitvānyathā-rūpaṁ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]], //mukti.// This is the definition of //mukti. Muktir hitvānyathā-rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ. Mukti// means you give up your abnormal condition of life and you be situated in your own constitutional life. That is //mukti.//

So we are spreading this //mukti.// Kṛṣṇa consciousness means //mukti// consciousness. Take it very seriously. Try to understand and take advantage of it and be happy. That is our request.

Thank you very much.
