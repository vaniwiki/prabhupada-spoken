====== Sannyāsa Initiation Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> Ahaṁ tariṣyāmi duranta-pāraṁ 
> tamo mukundāṅghri-niṣevayaiva 
> [SB 11.23.57].

As I explained in the beginning, the whole process is to engage in the service of Kṛṣṇa, whose another name is Mukunda. //Muk// means liberation, one who gives liberation and blissful life. So this Kṛṣṇa conscious movement is meant for delivering the conditioned soul of this age, Kali-yuga, as it was inaugurated by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself, accompanied by Nityānanda. He also took //sannyāsa// at the age of twenty-four years only, very young man.

So according to Vedic system, one takes //sannyāsa// at the fag end of life, just like I have taken. While I was going to die, I took //sannyāsa.// So, that is also, something is better than nothing. And now you have taken //sannyāsa// in prime youthful life. So you are all far better than me. You have got enough opportunity to serve Kṛṣṇa and His mission. I am old man. I may pass away at any moment. The wording is already there. So you remain and preach this cult.

The world is suffering for ignorance. They may be very proud of their advancement of education. After all, they have no education, no improvement. Simply they are bold enough, just like the insect. The insects are bold enough to fall down on the fire. Similarly, this civilization, without any control of the senses, //adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]], being unable to control the senses, exactly like the insect flies very boldly, falls on the fire, similarly, these uncontrolled senses [are] leading them to the darkest region of materialistic life.

They do not know it, and they don't care to know it, because they..., they have got their own theory that after this body, everything is finished, zero. But that is not the case. Not finished. There are so many species of life we have to enter, in any one of them, and this human form of life is the opportunity to get out of the clutches of //māyā,// this repetition of birth and death. And anyone can go back to home, back to Godhead, and become eternal associate of the Lord in blissful life. That opportunity is there.

So..., but this foolish civilization, they do not know it. It is our duty on behalf of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wants it. Lord Caitanya wants it. Therefore, success or no success, that doesn't matter; Kṛṣṇa will help us. But it is our duty to enlighten the whole human society with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are forgetful of Kṛṣṇa. They do not know what is God; therefore they say that God is dead, there is no God, God is impersonal. So many theories they have got. Actually, they have no idea what is God.

On the other hand, against this propaganda of godlessness, we are giving directly God. Here is God, Kṛṣṇa. We give His name, His father's name, His address, His activities, [laughter] everything. So these rascals may be informed at least. This is our duty. Try your best, and be blessed by Kṛṣṇa and Lord Caitanya.

Thank you very much.

All glories to His... [break] [end]
