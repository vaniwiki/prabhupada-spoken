====== Lecture [partially recorded] ======

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the secret. People are trying to bring in peace and prosperity in the world by so many activities---philanthropism, altruism, nationalism, socialism. And so-called religion also, they are trying to bring in. The whole idea is the human society should remain in peace and prosperity. And the vivid example is the United Nation in your country. America invited all nations that "Let us form a community of United Nation," but the America herself is fighting. You see? Because the idea was there to unite, but they do not know the basic principle, how to unite. That is the defect.

There is a church in the United Nation, and we tried to get a room there for making our propaganda. The church unity denied to give us. So their crippled mind is not expanded. //Sa mahātmā... Mahātmā// means broad-minded. //Su-durlabhaḥ.// So //mahātmā,// unless one becomes nonenvious, //mahātmā,// there is no question of so-called unity or fraternity. These are all false propaganda. It is not possible. But they will stick to that proposition, that "We have got this..." For the last twenty years... Why twenty years? More than twenty years. When this United Nation was started?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Even... Right after World War One they began.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Sometime 1948, '47. Hmm? Or earlier. Anyway, it is more than twenty-five, twenty..., twenty years. But what they have done? The people are still fighting. So here is the..., that we have to dovetail our service; we have to make Kṛṣṇa center. The Communists also, they tried to make by making the state as center. So that is also failure. Or the United Nation also. I do not know what is their center. Their center is politics, that's all.

So in this way there cannot be complete harmony. Complete harmony will be possible only when you bring in Kṛṣṇa. That will be explained in the next verse. //Īśāvasyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. Unless you bring Kṛṣṇa, or //īśa... Īśa// means the supreme controller. He is actually controlling. //Īśa. Īśa// means the controller. So there is a supreme controller. We see in the..., in our experience, that some of the objectives are living and some of them are not living. Animate or inanimate---these two things we see in our experience. But above this animate and inanimate there is supreme animate. That supreme animate is called //īśa. Īśa// or //īśvara// means controller.

So there are many //īśvaras,// or controllers, but the supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. There are many controllers. Some of you are also controller, in charge of some department. Similarly, controller over controller, controller over controller---there are many. And go up to Brahmā. The first creature within this universe is supposed to be the controller of this universe. But above him, there is another controller. That is Kṛṣṇa.

//Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro// [Bs. 5.52]. The material scientists, they are finding out the sun is the cause of all material manifestation. Actually, that's a fact. But what is the sun? The sun is also being controlled. That is stated in the //Brahmā-saṁhitā: yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejaḥ// [Bs. 5.52]. //Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā. Savitā// means the sun is the eye of the Supreme Lord, seeing everything.

You cannot hide anything. The sun, the moon, the day and the night---everyone is seeing your activities. And besides that, the Lord is within you also. So where you shall hide your sinful activities? You cannot hide anything. You can hide from the state laws, but you cannot hide yourself from God's law. That is not possible. //Īśāvasyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. Everywhere He is present.

So, //yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇām.// Actually, the sun is the eye of all the planets. Now we are in this planet, earthly planet. So actual our eyes are the sun. When there is sunrise, then we can see, "Oh, here it is, here it is, here it is." So, //yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇām.// All the planetary system that are existing within this universe, the sun is the eye, and because he is the eye of the Supreme Lord... //Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā.// It is the king of all planets. //Rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejaḥ. Aśeṣa-tejaḥ,// unlimited temperature.

Unlimited temperature. //Aśeṣa-tejaḥ.// And it is so powerful and so important, but what it is, his position? //Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro.// Under the direction of the Supreme, it is rotating in its own orbit. The sun has its own orbit. Just like this earth has its own orbit, similarly, sun, //sambhṛta-kāla-cakro, yasyājñayā...// The sun cannot go beyond that orbit. Just like we go to the sea. The order is, "My dear Pacific Ocean, you may be very great, but you cannot come beyond this." We are walking daily on the beach. Just four feet away, the water is there, but it cannot touch because the order is, "No, you cannot come. Up to this, that's all."

So everyone is ... Just like you have seen the horse is controlled by the driver, similarly, all of us being controlled. So we should remain controlled. That is life. We should not declare that "No. I don't want to be controlled." Then you'll fall down immediately. If you remain in your position, being controlled, being predominated...

Don't try to be predominator. Oh, then immediately fall down, because you are not predominator. It is a false claim that "I want to predominate. I am God. I am predominator. I am this. I am that." These are all rascaldom. Simply you remain yourself predominated. Agree to be controlled by Kṛṣṇa, and your life is successful.

Thank you very much.
