====== Room Conversation ======

**Śyāmasundara:**
Mr. Sarda has some relatives in London, and he was... The relatives were trying to force the girls to go to Nairobi, and they still, they did not want to go. So they ran away to Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
They went to Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have gone to Bombay?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes. So they are living in our temple in Bombay. The two girls. And this father wants them to come home for some reason. They don't want to come home.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. I did not know all these things.

**Śyāmasundara:**
It's not very important. He can send a letter. So many... If you try to involve yourself with so many of these things... [laughs] There are so many things like this going on all over the world, and if you try to deal with all of them...

**Prabhupāda:**
So why they have gone to Bombay?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Because their parents were sending agents to force them to go off to Nairobi. So they had to escape. They wanted to go to India.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what is their objection to go to Nairobi?

**Śyāmasundara:**
They just don't... They want be..., remain devotees. They say their father eats meat, and they violate all the principles, and they force them to stay away from the temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Father eats meat?

**Śyāmasundara:**
They think that their parents will try to force them from coming to the temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
But how we can advise them not..., to disobey their father?

**Śyāmasundara:**
No. I told Dhanañjaya that if his father..., their father wants, then they should go to Nairobi. He called me to ask advice, and I said then they should go if their father and mother insist. And he said, "But they don't want to go. What can I do? I can't force them to go."

So they ran away. They ran away to Bombay. I just found out maybe two days ago, and now they are in Bombay. That's what one girl said, who has just come from London. She said that they ran to Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they have gone to Bombay, that's all right. But his father is our [indistinct]... If he wants that their daughters should come back, they should help.

**Śyāmasundara:**
So I asked him, "If you want to talk with me, I will relay the message, much easier," and he said, "No, no, no. Well, I want to talk to Prabhupāda." I said, "Well, can't you send a wire or a letter?" And then he..., there was a long pause, and then the line went "click." [pause]

Karandhara and I were just talking, and you know they want..., these girls want to start that temple in Mexico, northern Mexico. But if so many things are happening as a result of too much expansion, why should we take more risk?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that will remain for the time.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Don't open any more centers for a while. There are devotees together. [pause] You want to have philosophy class?

**Prabhupāda:**
Mm-hm.

**Śyāmasundara:**
[laughs] All right. [aside about someone on the phone call] Oh, okay phone call.

**Devotee (1):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, that boy Pravīṇa-candra has got those two books that you asked for. You want I should get them, the books on Indian philosophy? Should I get them? [pause] He also got one additional one. These are the two you asked for. Here is the additional one that he found. [pause] [end]
