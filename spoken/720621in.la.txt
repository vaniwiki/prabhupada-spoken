**Devotees:**
[laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa, He's teacher of the whole universe, but He had also a teacher. This is the example in character, that one has to accept a teacher, a spiritual master. Kṛṣṇa is giving knowledge. He's..., His description is "all knowledge."

//Samagra,// full knowledge. But He is also going to a teacher's place to learn. Just Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself; He's accepting a spiritual master, Īśvara Purī. //Śrī Caitanya... Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya...// Hmm. //Īśvara...// Hmm. That means Īśvara Purī became glorified by Caitanya Mahāprabhu's acceptance of him as spiritual master.

But this is the etiquette, this is the Vedic principle, that even if You are God, if You, even if You know everything, still, You have to accept a teacher, a spiritual master. That is the Vedic system. So what are the rules?

**Sandy:**
No meat, fish or eggs, no gambling, no intoxication, no illicit sex life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. All right, come on. So, Sāndīpani Dāsī.

**Devotees:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
All glories to you Śrīla Prabhupāda. [obeisances] [end]
