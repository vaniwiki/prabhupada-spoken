====== Interview ======

**Devotee:**
Yes. I think this gentleman would like to have some interview with Śrīla Prabhupāda. [to other devotee:] You're going to translate, [indistinct]?

[to guest:] And you can sit here? And you can sit here, please?

**Prabhupāda:**
Give him some...

**Devotee:**
Sit here.

**Bhūgarbha:**
We have a cushion. [break] ...speak any English. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhūgarbha:**
The listeners probably only speak French.

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
[French]

[devotee translating questions and answers throughout]

**Frenchman:**
...great spiritual master, you kindly present yourself to the listeners to [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
I have already explained what is our mission, what is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Already I have explained to some extent, and if he wants some particular answer, he can ask me.

**Frenchman:**
[French]

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
He would like to know who you are, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and how old you are.

**Prabhupāda:**
I am now seventy-seven.

**Frenchman:**
[French]

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
[translating] For how long are you at the head of this movement?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, for the last five years.

**Frenchman:**
[French]

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
[translating] Can you please describe the dress in which you are clothed?

**Prabhupāda:**
You can ask about some philosophy. Dress, what people will benefit knowing about my dress? Instead of wasting time in that way... I can ask you why you are in dressed in that way... That's not very important thing.

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
[translates and then asks man to please pose questions about the philosophy]

**Bhagavān:**
Anyone can answer those questions.

**Frenchman:**
[French]

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
[translating] What do you think of the future?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
Of the future, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Future you can guess... Because I am seventy-seven. I may die. But these young men, they are taking. They will live, and they will spread all over the world.

**Frenchman:**
[French]

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
He's asking about your childhood, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
He'd like to know something about your childhood, would be my guess.

**Prabhupāda:**
So?

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
Childhood.

**Prabhupāda:**
My childhood? I was all along a devotee, from my childhood. Yes. My father was a devotee, and he trained me a devotee.

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
[again asks man to ask about the philosophy]

**Frenchman:**
[French]

**Guru-gaurāṅga:**
[translating] Are you happy? [devotees laugh]

**Prabhupāda:**
What do you think? What do you think? I'm happy or unhappy? [end]
