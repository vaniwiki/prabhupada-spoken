====== Room Conversation ======

[Poor audio]

**Prabhupāda:**
...by the size of the ocean they will be finished. But in the spiritual world the //ānanda,// the ocean of bliss, it increases. //Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. //Vardhanaṁ// means it increases. So [indistinct] in the blissful [indistinct] the more [indistinct] you will never be feeling tired. That is the difference between material pleasure and [indistinct]. So I am very glad, when I installed this Deity, that place was not to my satisfaction, and it remained not very good. [indistinct] I was little [indistinct] that "These boys and girls [indistinct] serve You, You kindly dictate..." [indistinct] So Kṛṣṇa will help you, //buddhi-yogaṁ.//

[02:15]

The Australia is one of their colony, but there is no satisfaction. We have seen---we got our temple in London---not that people are very happy. Even in London we have seen that Bedford Park, I was going every day for morning walk, but there also men were sleeping on the bench, without sufficient cover. So I used to show my students, "Why this man belong to British nation, who has got the British Empire background, why he is unhappy?"

[aside: What is that sound can it be stopped? Yes.

**Devotee:**
This is [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
So we should deeply study this fact, that people are struggling very hard, expanding themselves for achieving riches and wealth, but they're not satisfied. That’s a fact. Even British Empire could not satisfy them---more extension, more extension, more extension. There was Roman Empire, there was Mogul Empire. But this desire for sense gratification is so strong that if you go on pouring butter on fire it will never be satisfied; it will blaze more and more. [break] If one takes the lotus feet of Gaurāṅga as the ut... [break] [indistinct] ...he immediately understands the essence of devotional service. We therefore first of all offer our prayers to //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.//

Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings,

> gaurāṅgera duṭi pada, 
> jār dhana sampada, 
> se jāne bhakati-rasa-sār

Anyone who has accepted the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya as everything---all the riches and all wealth---immediately he enters in the kingdom of devotional service. He tastes without taste... Now so many of our European and American boys and girls, they are sticking to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Unless they are tasting something blissful, how they can stick to these principles? Our... [break] ...person like Lord Zetland... [break] ...no gambling, no meat-eating and no intoxication. He... [break] [indistinct]
