**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Uhu, yea, but the thing is that Prabhupāda that this river is sometimes very dangerous.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, over flooding?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Now I think, I don’t think it will over flood because they have got so many projects, dams and things like that but it used to over-flood very often. Every five or six years [indistinct]. But that over flooding would affect the whole city, so it doesn’t matt.. Head out the other bank of the city... that the waters would rush into the whole city and..

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Yes these are the three major cities... Rājkot, Dvārakā, Porbandar, Jāmnagar... But they are not very big cities... in Śaurāṣṭra.

Punjabis they go. Part, part... partly for business partly for working.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Yes. Have you ever been to London ghettos? London Indian ghettos? Near London. They say they are living very bad, in London, near London.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, London there are many Indians, although they are in London the live like Indians. [laughter]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, very similar. In Russell Square there is one hostel called, "//Indian Students Hostel//".

**Prabhupāda:**
You have been in London?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**

**Prabhupāda:**
I know one Maharashtrian lady she is running one hotel for the last 22 years, no 22 years was in 1968, must be 25 years. She invited me I went to her house, she is running one Maharashtrian hotel. She does not know English, she does not know. "a little, little.".. "Yes..yes no, very good." That’s all. [laughter].

**Devotee (2):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, excuse me what would you like for lunch?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dahl// and //capātīs,// would be nice.

**Devotee:**
You will be going back to India soon?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**

Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**

**Prabhupāda:**
Maṇipur.. centre...[Hindi].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Hindi] nagalok. There was a mistake in our dealing with the our leaders. They did not even allowed to come to the house, such a mistake. So they became all Christians.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they may not be allowed to enter the house but why they should not be elevated?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. This was a mistake done by the... Our leaders.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, I heard that in south India the Christian missionaries, even the //brāhmaṇas// are converted into Christians and how, you know, that the Christian priest would go into the house of a //brāhmaṇa// and put a block of bread into his well and then the //brāhmaṇa// would be debarred from his caste because the //brāhmaṇas// were, you know.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] also.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
So that is why he was forced to accept Christianity because he would not have any position in his camp. [end]
