**["Because of my past fruitive activities, I have now fallen into an ocean of nescience. I cannot find any means to get out of this great ocean, which is indeed like an ocean of poison. We are trying to be happy through sense enjoyment, but actually that so-called enjoyment is like food that is too hot and causes burning in the heart. I feel a burning sensation constantly, day and night, and thus my mind cannot find satisfaction."]**

**Prabhupāda:**
You don’t go with me. You simply in one meter, //ting ting ting ting.// When I go fast you may not go fast.

**Devotee:**
So just...shall I not hit four string lightly... a little bit like that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes that’s all. There this meter [indistinct] any condition this meter is nice... Yes.

[indistinct conversation]

[//mṛdaṅga//] [break]

[harmonium]

**Prabhupāda:**
If this air is not let out then the handle will go back. But they do not know it.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Stalls it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Immediately [indistinct] without pressing the button. Therefore we spoil the harmonium, yes.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Does it wreck the reeds? Or does it...[break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Due to the manufacturing process. Structure.

[//mṛdaṅga//]

**Devotee:**

[//karatālas//]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

[//mṛdaṅga//] [//karatālas//]

**Prabhupāda:**
So I need to explain.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Think you want to do it here?

**Prabhupāda:**
No I can do it.

//Anādi karama-phale. Anādi karama-phale pori' bhavārṇava-jale taribāre nā dekhi upāya.// This is a song sung by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, depicting the picture of the conditioned soul. It is said here, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura is speaking, taking himself as one of the ordinary human being, that due to my past fruitive activities, I have now fallen in this ocean of nescience, and I do not find any means of coming out of this great ocean. It is just like the ocean of poison, //e viṣaya-halāhale, divā-niśi hiyā jvale.//

As, if anyone takes some pungent food, it burns the heart, similarly, as we are trying to be happy by sense enjoyment, actually, it is just becoming the opposite, a cause of burning our heart. //E viṣaya-halāhale, divā-niśi hiyā jvale,// that burning sensation is going on twenty-four hours, day and night. //Mana kabhu sukha nāhi pāya,// and on account of this my mind is not at all in satisfaction.

//Āśā-pāśa-śata-śata kleśa dey abirata,// I am always making plan, hundreds and thousands, how I shall become happy, but actually all of them giving me trouble, pains, twenty-four hours. //Pravṛtti-ūrmira tāhe khelā,// it is exactly like the waves of the ocean, always dashing one another that is my position.

//Kāma-krodha-ādi caya, bāṭapāre dey bhaya,// besides that, there are so many thieves and rogues. Especially they are six in number, namely lust, anger, envy, illusion, and so many ways, they are always present, and I am afraid of them. //Abasāna hoilo āsi' belā,// in this way, my life is becoming advanced, or I am coming to the point of end.

//Jñāna-karma ṭhaga dui, more pratāriyā loi,// although this is my position, still, two kinds of activities, namely mental speculation and fruitive activities, they are cheating me. //Jñāna-karma ṭhaga, ṭhaga// means cheater. There are //jñāna-karma ṭhaga dui, more pratāriyā loi,// they are misleading me, and //abaśeṣe fele sindhu-jale,// after misleading me, they bring me on the seashore and pushes me down within the sea.

//E heno samaye bandhu tumi kṛṣṇa kṛpā-sindhu,// under the circumstance, my dear Kṛṣṇa, you are the only friend, //tumi kṛṣṇa kṛpā-sindhu. Kṛpā kori' tolo more bale,// now I have no strength to get out of this ocean of nescience, so I request, I pray unto Your lotus feet, that by Your strength, You kindly pick me up. //Patita-kiṅkare dhari' pāda-padma-dhūli kori',// after all, I am your eternal servant. So, somehow or other, I am fallen in this ocean, you kindly pick me up, and fix me as one of the dust of Your lotus feet.

//Deho bhaktivinoda āśraya,// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura entreats, that "Kindly give me shelter on Your lotus feet." //Āmi tava nitya-dāsa,// actually I am Your eternal servant. //Bhuliyā māyāra pāś,// somehow or other I forgot You, and I am now fallen in the network of //māyā. Baddha ho'ye āchi doyāmoy,// my dear Lord, I have been entangled in this way. Kindly save me.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Five minutes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So [indistinct] [break] [end]
