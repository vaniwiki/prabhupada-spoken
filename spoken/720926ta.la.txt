====== Talk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
The love of God... Love is... [break] is manifested in so many ways but because it is misplaced not properly just like foodstuffs somebody has stolen it that you take this foodstuff within your body but if I do not know that I am placing here there here there [indistinct] that is the proper [break] place. Similarly my propensity of my loving others is there---others means, beyond my somebody else. That somebody else I do not know who is, therefore I am [indistinct]. [end]
