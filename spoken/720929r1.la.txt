====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Eh?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh simply warning?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Just warning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah //acha. hirud tinak die vidya vidya high tine tine tak, hirud tinak die vidya vidya high tine tine tak, hirud tinak die vidya vidya high tine tine tak.//[?] [door opens]

**Pradyumna:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda something about the tickets. We have those around the world tickets, we have round the world tickets and those tickets have a certain amount of. Have an itinerary. The itinerary is that we go from.

**Prabhupāda:**
That you understand, I cannot remember.

**Pradyumna:**
Well eh, there’s just one thing, that Karāndhara wanted me to ask about. That the tickets are going to be ah, $1900 apiece.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Pradyumna:**
And Karāndhara just wanted you to know that the money is coming out of the book fund.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Ask Karāndhara to see me. Yes... That is the... Called tactics. If the teachers are rascals themselves then there won’t be any fight. There should be [indistinct]. You know the tigers in the circus?

**Karāndhara:**
Yes. They pull out the whip but they never hit the tiger.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Karāndhara:**
They never hit the tiger.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Karāndhara:**
They just crack the whip.

**Prabhupāda:**
The tiger is so afraid simply by seeing that---he shuddered. Summarily it is not used. Simply in the hand. That is tactic. So if a tiger can be trained in that way, an animal, a ferocious animal and they cannot train the children? It needs a good teacher[?] Children will cry they will fight but you have to create. Teachers [indistinct] [LOUD] TAK! TAK! TAK! Immediately they stop.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
I have seen it... In our childhood I remember two teachers, we were so afraid we would going 50 miles away to avoid.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is [indistinct] even though [indistinct]. "What is Bhagavān doing he has had so many accidents." It was going in the [indistinct] immediately transferred. He created such an atmosphere simply by seeing, all the children cried.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Even in the [indistinct] we have some afraid---some type of fearness with the professors also [indistinct] we don’t have any.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well that is required or deviance is the first form...

[Long pause]

So you have, recording department has not paid me.

**Karāndhara:**
Not paid?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not paid and so what is that?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[laughs]

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
I mean about the credit?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Yes its royalties. We pay from the records that sold.

**Prabhupāda:**
And when it will be sold?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Well the first record will be ready in about a week.

**Karāndhara:**
They are bringing it [indistinct] did they get more work done on it?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Yes [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
There was, there was a contract between a teacher and his students, law students. So the students says, "Sir I have no money I shall pay you when I practical." [indistinct] so he says, "all right." So after learning the law, so he was not going to the court... [indistinct]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] So this proposal is like that.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Making recording, there is no sales, [indistinct] there is no sales, so when there is sales I’ll pay [indistinct]

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
It is common standard practice in the recording...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
So when the sale is made the artist.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Artist don’t usually get paid [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Artist do not get paid?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
No.

**Karāndhara:**
Sometimes they get advancement but goes against our future development. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh yes. So you can practice it. Then the teacher did one practise he found a suitable criminal.

**Karāndhara:**
He [indistinct] in the court.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Karāndhara:**
He [indistinct] in the court.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So.

**Karāndhara:**
No respect for him.

**Prabhupāda:**
He wanted defence to rebel so then he said finally, "my Lord either you let him pay you know now he is practising." This is called tit-for-tat.

**Karāndhara:**
Tit for tat?

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] Tit-for-tat. The student was also clever but the teacher was also more clever. All right.

[Devotee’s leave offering their obeisances]

**Prabhupāda:**
turn it off?

**Devotee:**
No it’s [indistinct]... [end]
