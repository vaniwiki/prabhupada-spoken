====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Easy-going, that is actual real life. But that easy-going, you must come to that stage. If you come to a healthy stage, then when you eat, you can digest nicely. But unhealthy stage, if you eat, how you will digest? Therefore you have to cure your disease first of all. Then you eat, it will be digested. So in the material condition, nothing can be easy-going. Therefore, how it is called conditioned life?

**Jayatīrtha:**
We're bound up by so many conditions.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, the conditions. So first of all you come out of the conditioned life. Just like we are trying to go to other planets with so many machines, so many mechanical arrangements. But if you have got spiritual body, you can go anywhere. Anywhere you can go. As Nārada Muni is going, traveling, any planet he likes, he is going. That freedom is there, but that is in spiritual body. So you come to the spiritual body first, and then you get all freedom. Whatever you like, you can do. Whatever you desire, you can get.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Just like Śrīla Prabhupāda gives the example like Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it may look like poison at the beginning, but at the end it will be nectar.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
And so they..., they're reversing that, these people who...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// What is appearing as poison in the beginning, that will prove nectar at the end. [break] Even ordinary dealings. Just like I have given one watch to Śyāmasundara, that Omega. So I paid him... One hundred dollars has been spent to make it correct time, [chuckles] but it is not. Everyone, "Yes, I will make it repaired."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Just repairing?

**Prabhupāda:**
Repairing, four, five dollars, six dollars, and it is the same. And it is going on for the last one year.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Like automobiles, automobiles are built to break down in four or five years at the most so that you'll have to go and buy a new one. That's the way they build them. They could make them stronger, stronger parts, stronger engines, but they don't, so that in four or five years they'll break down and you'll have to come back and buy a new one.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Māyaiva vyāvahārike// [SB 12.2.3]. Even in ordinary dealings, people will cheat you. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Māyaiva vyāvahārike. Vyavaha,// ordinary dealings. Even in ordinary talkings they will tell so many lies. [break] They live nicely in fresh air, in open air, trees, and talking about their business, and they are happy. They have no problems for eating, sleeping, mating, nothing. Everything is there.

And we are claiming civilized. We are dealing with science to improve conditions; the rascals, they are becoming more and more degraded. They have no science, they have no laboratory, they have no university. How they are living peacefully? So it is... If this life is better or this life of cheating and imperfectness, full of anxieties, this life is better? Which life is better?

**Jayatīrtha:**
The animals, they are living by the arrangement of nature; they live according to their nature. Whereas the human beings...

**Prabhupāda:**
They have no anxiety.

**Jayatīrtha:**
...perform prohibited activities and requirements and are living actually against their own nature. So the animal's life in that sense is better. At least they're not performing any sinful activities.

**Prabhupāda:**
That I explained last time, that they are simply misusing their advancement, and they are satisfied when they have got a motorcar instead of bullock cart. That's all. They think, "Now I am advanced. We had bullock cart, now we have got motorcar with three hundred thousand parts. And every part will give me troubles as soon as it is old," [chuckles] and that is advancement. As soon as one part is broken, the bullock cart is called for. They get a bullock cart to carry this motorcar. [break] Everyone is servant.

[pause] Therefore we teach our students to address "//prabhu.//" "I am your servant, you are my master, //prabhu.//" That is the meaning of //prabhu. Prabhu// means master. And //Prabhupāda// means supreme master. That is the meaning.

**Jayatīrtha:**
In this country there's a saying that everyone should be their own master. That's the philosophy. It's called individualism.

**Prabhupāda:**
Own master... He does not know how to make..., how to become own master. That he does not know. He speaks only. Now, what is your explanation to become own master? How do you explain? Explain.

**Jayatīrtha:**
The idea is that they want to be..., to determine their own destiny.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayatīrtha:**
They want to determine their own destiny. They think if they work very hard, they'll be able to build up their environment... [indistinct: noise of plane taking off].

**Prabhupāda:**
This is not explanation. You should know: own master means master of the senses.

**Jayatīrtha:**
That they don't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Actually, everyone is servant of the senses at the present moment. So one has to become the master of the senses. That is called //svāmī. Svāmī// means master. //Gosvāmī// means master of the senses, the same thing. So everyone is servant of the senses. Everyone is acting being dictated by the senses: "Oh, it is very nice. Let me see." The eyes dictate what we see. What is time now?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Five after seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Five minutes after seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
[//japa//] [break]

[in car]

**Devotee (1):**
We were given a ride by some young people, a couple, and they were..., this was in Bakersfield, California. They said that a //mahārāja// of Guru Maharaj-ji, a //mahātmā,// they called him a //mahātmā,// a disciple follower of this fourteen-year-old so-called //avatāra,// is in Bakersfield, and he's staying there. So...

**Prabhupāda:**
Where he is now?

**Devotee (1):**
He's supposed to still be in Bakersfield after Guru Maharaj-ji, but..., this //mahātmā,// his follower. But they were very anxious to follow in his way, because Guru Maharaj-ji is supposed to give direct perception of God. It's described that he will show you light.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee (1):**
Yes. They said when you meet him, he can show you light. He's giving direct understanding of God in this way, this light. When I tried to ask them to understand some Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they simply refused to listen. They had no desire to hear about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They said, "What your spiritual master has to offer? What can you offer except just some scriptures?" They had no respect for the //śāstra.// So many young people are following this.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Everyone wants instant realization.

**Prabhupāda:**
Outlaws will say like that. "What education you have got? You have simply studied some law book." Outlaws will say like that. They will simply sell some book, "Now we are better than you. Without studying we have written."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That's why they are called demons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are called demons, because...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] [indistinct] here?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes, they're in Hollywood. I've never seen it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayatīrtha:**
They have a place in Hollywood. I've never seen it, but I know people who have gone there. They become like a fad, like Maharishi. About two years ago he was very big; thousands of people were coming.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Jayatīrtha:**
This Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. He was very big. He was in the newspapers, and thousands of people came and paid thirty-five dollars, took initiation. But now you don't hear anything about him. So this man will come, make a big show, make some money, but in two years he'll just be a memory.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] Why does he not come again? He has gone forever.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
You have said that whenever there is Kṛṣṇa there will be success everywhere, all the time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
When there is Kṛṣṇa, there will be success everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is real success. [break] Big problems [indistinct]. There are so many places I see the sign for.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes, they are one of the biggest corporations in the United States.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Jayatīrtha:**
They're one of the biggest corporations in the United States. They have a..., at least one or two thousand of those, I think more than two thousand.

**Devotee (1):**
They're all across the country. Kentucky Fried Chicken. Colonel Sanders.

**Prabhupāda:**
Many thousands of chickens are being killed.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Oh, millions of chickens.

**Devotee (1):**
Millions every day.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Just like this McDonald's hamburger stands, they have a sign in front of their hamburger stands---they have also several thousand hamburger stands---the sign says, "Over ten billion hamburgers served." Their company has served ten billion hamburgers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] [end]
