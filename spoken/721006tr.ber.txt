====== Tour ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Well.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] [sounds like a big empty room]

**Prabhupāda:**
I have heard the chanting.

**Karāndhara:**
They have, instead of chain they have made this a rail.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice. So this is our own home.

**Karāndhara:**
Yes it is owned.

**Prabhupāda:**
How you can change it? Covered with so much dust.

[Jingling noises]

**Devotee:**
[Offers obeisances]

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale 
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good you are making [indistinct].

**Devotee:**
My wife.

**Brahmānanda:**
We are making it a large canopy for the Deities.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct].

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. And then we will buy one from India.

**Devotees:**
[Offers obeisances]

> nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhū-tale
> śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine...

**Prabhupāda:**
Who has painted this Sanskrit?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh.

**Karāndhara:**
Jayānanda’s wife, Trayī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Karāndhara:**
It is the //Īśopaniṣads.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

[indistinct dialogue between devotees]

**Karāndhara:**
Would you like to sit Prabhupāda or see the rest of the temple?

**Prabhupāda:**
I can [indistinct] it. So //prasādam// is there or here?

**Brahmānanda:**
There. For you? Yes in there. Do you wish to take here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Anywhere.

[Indistinct dialogue between devotees]

**Brahmānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda I was wondering if you’d like to [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
That’s alright.

[Phone ringing. Chanting. Moving noises. Indistinct dialogue] [break]

**Devotee:**
...I’ve so many things to do in this house I missed it.

**Prabhupāda:**
And this is not...

**Devotee:**
Spiritual Sky. [indistinct dialogue] [loud traffic noise] [break] [end]
