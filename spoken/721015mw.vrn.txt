====== Morning Walk ======

**Śyāmasundara:**
Did Vāsudeva carry Kṛṣṇa across the Yamunā?

**Indian man:**
Yes. Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
But their home was somewhere, other place.

**Indian man:**
Huh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Their... The other Gokula was somewhere else.

**Indian man:**
The Kṛṣṇa was carried through old Gokula.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Ah.

**Indian man:**
Old Gokula.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Not at this place.

**Indian man:**
Not at this place. But for those whom..., for those people who are in, this is the real Gokula. [indistinct], but I think the old Gokula is that. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...it is available?

**Devotee (1):**
Some boxes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Indian man (2):**
Boxes, oh, you leave it there.

**Devotee:**
Huh? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Gokula. //Haribol.// That does not cooperate with the modern...

**Indian man:**
No. It must have changed completely.

[break] [//kīrtana//]

**Śyāmasundara:**
...tell us a little bit about the temple as we move?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This temple was constructed by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, one of the first disciples of Lord Caitanya, and this is Narottama //samādhi.// Here is Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī entombed, and here is Rūpa Gosvāmī entombed. Later on, several other devotees, they are not entombed like them. Flowers from their body, they were placed. It is called //puṣpa-samādhi.// But here, the original bodies.

**Devotee (1):**
Ah. This is Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja's body?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (1):**
Original bodies.

**Prabhupāda:**
And that side, the original body of Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī. [break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
...a well?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is the original well.

**Lady passer-by:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda]

**Devotee (1):**
Did the Gosvāmīs drink from this well, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is... This well water is used for cooking, for... [break]

**Devotee (1):**
And Jīva Gosvāmī and Rūpa, they drank from this well?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with lady passers-by] This is the place for dining. The Gosvāmīs, they used to dine here, this room.

**Devotee (1):**
Is this building four or five hundred years old? This very room?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Oh, yes.

**Devotee (1):**
This is the original building?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Not less than four hundred and fifty years.

**Śyāmasundara:**
And they used to meet here daily?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They, all the Gosvāmīs, used to sit down here. And Rūpa Gosvāmī's //bhajana,// he was dancing here, and after his passing away, he was entombed there. But that tomb is Lokanātha Gosvāmī. He is also one of the important Gosvāmīs.

**Devotee (1):**
[indistinct] Gosvāmī.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Rūpa Gosvāmī.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with passers-by] [break] House tax.

**Devotee (1):**
House tax? There were not for any buildings on house tax?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with Indians] [breaks]

**Śyāmasundara:**
Could you tell us any stories about Rūpa Gosvāmī while we are sitting here, or any...

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi to //gosāi// of temple] Rūpa Gosvāmī was a minister. So after retirement he, under the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he came to Vṛndāvana.

**Indian man:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Rūpa Gosvāmī. So formerly they were living under trees. That I have already described in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Later on, when Jīva Gosvāmī constructed this temple, his nephew and disciple, at that time Rūpa Gosvāmī also, he lived with his disciple. Actually, this temple belongs to Jīva Gosvāmī, and Rūpa Gosvāmī's temple is at...

**Śyāmasundara:**
We saw it.

**Prabhupāda:**
...Govindajī.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Sanātana Gosvāmī's temple is at Madana-Mohana. But when Jīva Gosvāmī was here, naturally---they were elder uncle---so lived together, and because they, all of them lived here, so other Gosvāmīs, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī, Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, all of them used to meet here. And Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī used to live [indistinct], and all other Gosvāmīs used to be here. And this is explained, Rūpa Gosvāmī's //bhajana,// they chant.

**Indian man:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda] [break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
Are those rooms you live in, were they formerly inhabited by the Gosvāmīs, Jīva or Rūpa Gosvāmī, those rooms you have now?

**Prabhupāda:**
These rooms?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Śyāmasundara:**
These came after that time.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is..., rooms were existing, but they used to sit down here.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Was Vṛndāvana mostly...?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] In this place, all the six Gosvāmīs used to sit down and read from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

**Śyāmasundara:**
And, and did...

**Indian man:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Śyāmasundara:**
At that time Vṛndāvana was existing as a village, or mostly open area?

**Prabhupāda:**
Formerly, before Lord Caitanya's coming here, this was open field. Nothing was here.

**Śyāmasundara:**
So everything has been built up.

**Prabhupāda:**
Since the Gosvāmīs. [Hindi] So after the Gosvāmīs came here, practically, all this Vṛndāvana city has developed. Before that, it was open field. [Hindi] You developed this photo here in India also?

**Devotee (1):**
Ah, some of it.

**Indian man:**
At least mine and Swāmījī's.

**Prabhupāda:**
You send some copies here.

**Devotee (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] You can take one photograph alone. Have you got [indistinct]?

**Śyāmasundara:**
This man here. This man.

**Devotee:**
Where?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Right here. Is he one of your old friends?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
He lives in the...

**Prabhupāda:**
In this temple.

**Śyāmasundara:**
He lives in this temple. This, where the... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
He has left his key? [break]

**Śyāmasundara:**
//Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// was written here, Prabhupāda, in this place?

**Indian man:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
We have to go Imlitala.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Imlitala? The car is not here?

**Indian man:**
No, he's just coming the...

**Gargamuni:**
It's just a very brief walk.

**Śyāmasundara:**
We can walk.

**Gargamuni:**
It's very brief walk.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Is that, is that //mahā-rāsa// place on the way?

**Gargamuni:**
It's, yes, it's more or less. Sevakunj.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Is it, is it, er, should we... [break] When we go to Bombay, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct].

**Devotee (2):**
The place where //mahā-rāsa// took place?

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Devotee (2):**
So it is of no significance to us, then?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
This... Words and films.

**Indian man:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] New York, San Francisco, Los Angles, Chicago, Boston, Buffalo, Montreal. Sixty-six all over the world.

**Indian man:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. On the carpets. Give immediately, on the carpets.

**Devotee:**
Carpets.

**Prabhupāda:**
Give immediately. And you come to the Imlitala.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Indian man:**
[Hindi] [referring to Sarasvatī] Don't eat that. She is licking that...

**Śyāmasundara:**
What, coins?

**Indian man:**
No. Licking the some sort of [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
[greeting Indian man] Oh, how you have come here?

**Indian man (3):**
[indistinct]

**Śyāmasundara:**
This is a new edition?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
[dogs barking] Oh, all the dogs are coming. Is the driver here? There's the driver. Should we walk, or...

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with guest] [break] ...and how it is concerned, we can get many. The thing is, who will live here? Who will manage?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hmm. I've been thinking a lot about it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
I'm thinking that if we developed a very large center here, like a headquarters, it would have worldwide impact.

**Prabhupāda:**
Uh.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Because, just like a throwing a rock in the pond, first of all the devotees of India would all be coming...

**Prabhupāda:**
Uh.

**Śyāmasundara:**
...and it would revitalize the spiritual life of India from this point, and then the whole world would come to Vṛndāvana.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, now next thing, what to do?

**Śyāmasundara:**
I was thinking perhaps I would like to devote a lot of time to raising funds for such a project---in the United States, England. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Śyāmasundara:**
Manage.

**Prabhupāda:**
Manage? There is no scarcity of funds.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes. If we built the most magnificent temple and center here, which would be full of spiritual life, day and night hundreds of devotees would be there having //kīrtana,// and all the devotees of Vṛndāvana would come. They're simply astounded by our //kīrtana// when they come to our house.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Śyāmasundara:**
What's this? This is another temple? Imlitala?

**Devotee (2):**
Imlitala.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Oh, this is not the entrance?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man:**

**Indian man (2):**

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Śyāmasundara:**
//Jaya.//

**Indian man:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jayo// Mahārāja. [Hindi]

**Śyāmasundara:**
That is your Guru Mahārāja, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Śyāmasundara:**
That is a //mūrti// of Guru Mahārāja?

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Aaah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not like [indistinct]. [Hindi]

**Śyāmasundara:**
[to daughter] Sarasvatī, who is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with Indian man]

**Śyāmasundara:**
What is the history of this temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
[to Indian man] You say.

**Indian man:**
You would like to say in English?

**Śyāmasundara:**
Ah, yes.

**Indian man:**
Not in Hindi.

**Śyāmasundara:**
If you can speak English, please.

**Indian man:**
This is an old place, Vṛndāvana. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu came here and sat under this tree nearly five hundred years back. He sat under this tree and meditated: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, until midday.

Several days He chanted His name and came here and sat. This tree is the old tree of Dvāpara-yuga. Under this tree, Rādhikā and Kṛṣṇa both met once. This is written in //Param-Gita//[?]. For this reason Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu came here. With this reason He came here and sat under this tree and recited the name Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

When He sat here once, one Vaiṣṇava, name Kṛṣṇadāsa, name Kṛṣṇadāsa, he saw, at night, he dreamt of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and became mad to see Him, and he crossed the Yamunā River, Keśīghāṭa, and gradually came here and saw the glorious silhouette of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he made his obeisance to His feet.

And Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu touch him, and he became mad with //kṛṣṇa-prema,// and then Mahāprabhu, from this place, Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu came, went to Rādhā-kuṇḍa, but displayed the name of this before that time.

**Prabhupāda:**
He went to Rādhā-kuṇḍa?

**Indian man:**
Rādhā-kuṇḍa. He went there and asked the old gentlemen of that place that "Where is Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa?" But none of them [indistinct] Rādhā-kuṇḍa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes, discovery of Rādhā-kuṇḍa.

**Śyāmasundara:**
From this place He went there.

**Indian man:**
Yes, He went there, Rādhā-kuṇḍa, Śyāma-kuṇḍa place. Ariṣṭa-grāma.[?] Ariṣṭāsura was [indistinct], killed there by [indistinct] Kṛṣṇa. So He went there and asked the old people in there, but nobody can say that where is Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa. After that, Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself said to the field, that "This is Rādhā-kuṇḍa and this is Śyāma-kuṇḍa," and that this place was low place; there's some water there. He lifted the waters to His head [indistinct] and said that "These two places are Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa." In this way, Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Śyāma-kuṇḍa were discovered there.

After that He went to Sola, Solakṣetra[?], and because, and Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu came here, so after His visit here He went to [indistinct], and Rūpa and Sanātana first came here. And after, following them, all the Vaiṣṇavas came to Vṛndāvana, and gradually Vṛndāvana was discovered [indistinct], and places and important places which..., holy places of this Vṛndāvana and Vraja-maṇḍala was discovered by the followers of Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, [indistinct]. They both discovered all the places, several holy places of Vṛndāvana. In this way, this place was discovered.

Nobody knew this place. Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself came here, sat under this tree, because under this tree, Kṛṣṇa and Rādhikā met. [Hindi] [break] Once, at the time of //rāsa,// how They met here once at the time of //rāsa,// Śrīmate Rādhā, Rādhikā felt that "I am not be able..."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Able to walk." He carried...

**Indian man:**
"I'm not really [indistinct]." So He left //rāsa// and went out. Śrī Kṛṣṇa saw that there is no Rādhikā, every..., all the //gopīs// were still, Rādhikā not there, so He left all them and went out and began to search Her. But through roaming about Vṛndāvana He did not caught Her, and after became very regretted. He sat under this tree, and Rādhikā afterwards came here and met Him. In this way, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa go, met here.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with Indian] Guru-Gaurāṅga, then Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Where is my stick?

**Devotee (2):**
Stick? Just here.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] //Ācchā.// If you want to take photo, you can take.

**Indian man:**
If you wish, you can take photos.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is it ready? Film is ready? Where is he? He has gone?

**Śyāmasundara:**
You can take photos of the Deities if you like.

**Devotee (1):**
He has gone to the other side.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Śyāmasundara:**
The, the movie camera.

**Devotee (1):**
It's really dark.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Oh, it's dark.

**Indian man:**
He stepped here. Big!

**Śyāmasundara:**
It's very large. Large.

**Prabhupāda:**

Who is that, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**

**Śyāmasundara:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
He also went to London. Yes. I sometimes speak that he talked with Lord Zetland.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Ahah. But he left no followers there?

[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you very much.

[break] Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Śyāmasundara:**
When Kṛṣṇa used to come here, was His home in Gokula at that time, or Mathurā?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
And He used to come here for herding cows.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (2):**
But He did not live here.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Was there any palace here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?
