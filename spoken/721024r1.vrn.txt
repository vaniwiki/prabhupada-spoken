====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Now in Vṛndāvana here is one temple... There is likely that they cannot [indistinct for several minutes]. Suppose everything is in our hand[?]. How to manage? Therefore accepting the main temple, you have to [indistinct] how to manage. This is between ourself. Suppose if Bharatpur Mahārāja after some time [indistinct]. In this temple also, I am making the important decisions. [break] ...is not in favor of any of the parties. So if they also come in our hands, it has to be [indistinct].

Now, supposing you have got three, then how you to manage? Simply taking over is no good. Because they are giving, means they cannot manage. That property is very valuable property, Bharatpur place. So they are thinking of giving it over to us because it is not being managed. Their position is here. So up to now we are strong. But if our, what is called, cooperation becomes slack, then our temple also the same thing will be.

That, the [indistinct], that I am staying here for the last ten or twelve years and paying, but the property belongs to the Deity. And there are several sevaites. Sometimes somebody starts noting that you neglect; sometimes somebody takes money in other. So what is my position? [indistinct] the renter may decide what is my position. Actually, in terms of the renter, I am tenant for these two rooms, and that also. [indistinct]

[break] ...for some place it becomes difficult. Find out that man's name [indistinct]. Of course, I have got many [indistinct]. But it is sentiment. We have established [indistinct]. Suppose we beget the management for the whole [indistinct]? How we shall manage?

**Gurudāsa:**
Not only how, but who.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Gurudāsa:**
Not how, as well as who. Because how is not... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The mouse are afraid of cats. So they held a meeting [indistinct]. Then the resolution was passed that "Let there be a bell in the neck of the cat fixed up, so that when he is coming, the bell will ring, and we shall know, 'Now he is coming.' " Immediately it was passed. The first resolution was passed. Then how to bell? Who will go to bell? [laughs]

Because anyone who will go to bell the cat, he will be devoured. So the plan-making that "This will be managed like this," there is a resolution, bells, fixing of a bell. Now go in and fix up the bell.

**Gurudāsa:**
It seems that Bhavānanda Prabhu is the best manager.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, manager anyone can become, but manpower... We have no Indian members chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Gurudāsa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
So how much men we shall import? And whether it is feasible by importing men to manage this facility?

**Gurudāsa:**
Now there seems to be a surplus of men in Bombay, from all the reports I've gotten. So some could come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
But...

**Prabhupāda:**
If we remain here and attract foreigners to come...

**Gurudāsa:**
The manpower will come from them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not only visitors [indistinct], those who are spiritually inclined. In that way we may get opportunity.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
The another point is that when we manage these things, there are many //guṇḍās// in Vṛndāvana; they will try to create some trouble. Just like [indistinct]. You were present? This boy was fighting with one man. You were not present?

**Gurudāsa:**
No. What time was it?

**Prabhupāda:**
When the minister came.

**Gurudāsa:**
No. I was not here at that time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sometimes it becomes quarrel. [break] [end]
