====== The Nectar of Devotion ======

**Pradyumna:**
[reading] "...may be divided into two classes: one class may be for achieving a certain goal, and the other may be for avoiding some unfavorable circumstance. In Sanskrit these activities are called //pravṛtti// and //nirvṛtti,// positive and negative action.

"There are many examples of negative action. For example, a diseased person has to be cautious and take medicine in order to avoid some unfavorable illness. Those who are cultivating spiritual life and executing devotional service are always engaged in activity. Such activity can be performed with the mind or with the..., with the body or with the mind.

"Thinking, feeling and willing are all activities of the mind, and when we will do something, the activity comes to be manifest by the gross bodily senses. Thus, in our mental activities, we should always try to think of Kṛṣṇa and try to plan how to please Him, following in the footsteps of the great //ācāryas// and the personal spiritual master.

There are activities of the body, activities of the different senses and activities of speech. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person engages his words in preaching the glories of the Lord. This is called //kīrtana.// And by his mind a Kṛṣṇa conscious person always thinks of the activities of the Lord as He is speaking on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra or engaging in His various pastimes at Vṛndāvana with His devotees. In this way, one can always think of the activities and pastimes of the Lord. This is the mental culture of Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not inactivity. This we have discussed yesterday. Actually the activity is being influenced by the soul. But it is being expressed through intelligence, mind and body. The activities are coming from the spiritual platform, but because it is now contaminated by the material coverings, the activities are not very adjusted. Diseased activities.

The thinking, feeling and willing... This thinking, feeling and willing now polluted on account of material coverings. Therefore we have to revert to the thinking, feeling and willing by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as it is explained here, that we shall always think of Kṛṣṇa's activities, we shall always feel for satisfying Kṛṣṇa, and we shall always will to enact as He desires.

The same feeling... //Nirbandhe kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yukta-vairāgyam ucyate// [Brs. 1.2.255]. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has given us two formulas how to become Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or how to remain in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So one formula is that //anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ.//

You should not be attached to the //viṣayas.// Just like we have got a tendency to construct a skyscraper building, as in your country you do. So you should not be attached to the skyscraper building, but you can utilize the tendency by constructing a big temple like skyscraper for Kṛṣṇa. In this way, you have to purify your material activities.

Actually, in pure Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is nothing material. I have several times explained: material activities means activities without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is material activity. Just like we are speaking through this microphone. We do not reject it as material. We take it as spiritual, because it is being used in spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ. Yathā arhati,// as it deserves.

Because this microphone is made of material elements, earth, water, fire, air... But this, if we remember that these material energies, earth, water, air, fire, sky, even mind, intelligence, ego... //Prakṛti me, prakṛti me bhinnā aṣṭadhā// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. They're also energies of Kṛṣṇa. They're not separate from Kṛṣṇa. Therefore if Kṛṣṇa is spirit, then these so-called material elements, they are also spirit.

But it is used as material because we do not remember the relationship of these material elements with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore the conclusion is when we are forgetful of Kṛṣṇa, then it is material. Otherwise, there is nothing as material. Everything is spiritual. Because //brāhmaṇaḥ śakti.// It is described in the //Viṣṇu Purāṇa, eka-deśa sthitasyāgner jyotsnā vistāriṇī yathā, sarvedaṁ brahmaṇaḥ śakti...// [[books:cc:madhya:20:110|[Cc. Madhya 20.110]]]. I just don't remember the whole verse.

So everything, this is //śakti-pariṇāma-vāda. Śakti-pariṇāma-vāda.// Everything... //Sarvaṁ khalu idaṁ brahma.// Everything that we experience, that is manifestation of the energy of Kṛṣṇa. //Sarvedam akhilaṁ jagat. Brahmaṇaḥ śakti. Śakti// and //śaktimān,// they are not different. So if we accept everything as expansion of //brahmaṇaḥ śakti,// energy of Kṛṣṇa, and utilize it for Kṛṣṇa, then there is nothing such thing as material. Everything becomes spiritual.

So if we think in that way, thinking, feeling and willing, if we utilize our psychological activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then we keep steady in..., attached with Kṛṣṇa. //Yukta-vairāgyam ucyate. Vairāgya// means renunciation. We do not require to renounce anything, provided we see everything dovetailed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is required.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"Similarly, we can offer many services with our bodily activities, but all such activities must be in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. This relationship is established by connecting oneself with the bona fide spiritual master who is the direct representative of Kṛṣṇa in disciplic succession. Therefore the execution of Kṛṣṇa consciousness activities with the body should be directed by the spiritual master and then performed with faith."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We should not manufacture in our own way, that "This is Kṛṣṇa's activity." It must be confirmed by the spiritual master. Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has explained in his comment on //Bhagavad-gītā// in connection with the verse //vyavasāyātmikā-buddhiḥ ekeha kuru-nandana...// [[books:bg:2:41|[Bg. 2.41]]] //Vyavasāyātmikā-buddhiḥ, niścayātmikā-buddhiḥ.// Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says that "Whatever order I get from my spiritual master, that is my life and soul. I must execute it thoroughly, without caring for my personal convenience or inconvenience." That is called //vyavasāyātmikā-buddhi. Eka.//

We cannot manufacture anything as Kṛṣṇa conscious activities, but we must be ready always to carry out the order of spiritual master, who is representative of Kṛṣṇa. //Sākṣād dharitvena samasta-śāstrair.// The spiritual master is recognized as the bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa. //Sākṣād dharitvena.// Therefore he should be offered respect as good as to Kṛṣṇa. //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo.// And if we can please our spiritual master, then we please Kṛṣṇa.

Just... Somebody says that "Kṛṣṇa appeared five thousand years ago. He's no longer present. Then how we shall execute Kṛṣṇa's order?" Kṛṣṇa's order can be executed by executing the order of the spiritual master. //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo.// We cannot disobey. //Yasyaprasādād na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.// This is the process.

In //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it has been very extensively explained what is the position of the spiritual master. But at the same time, the spiritual master does not accept himself as he's God, or Kṛṣṇa, like the Māyāvādīs. No. The bona fide spiritual master always thinks of himself as the servant of the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa. //Gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayoḥ dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. Not that "Because my disciples accept me as good as Kṛṣṇa, and because my disciples offer me respect exactly he offers respect to Kṛṣṇa... That does not mean I am Kṛṣṇa. I am servant of the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa." This is the position.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"The connection with the spiritual master is called initiation. From the date of initiation by the spiritual master, the connection between Kṛṣṇa and a person cultivating Kṛṣṇa consciousness is established. Without initiation by a bona fide spiritual master, the actual connection with Kṛṣṇa consciousness is never performed."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We must connect with the current. Just like you have fitted your room with electrical wires, but if you do not touch it with the current going on, then simply electrical fitting with not help you. Similarly, initiation is essential. //Ādau gurvāśrayam.// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī recommends in his //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// for executing proper spiritual life, one must take shelter of the bona fide spiritual master. //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreyaḥ uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. Person who is actually interested in //uttamam. Uttamam// means transcendental. //Udgata-tamam,// "after darkness." This material world is darkness. //Tamasi mā jyotir gamaḥ.// The spiritual world is full of light. Therefore anything spiritual, that is called //uttamam.//

There... Kṛṣṇa's another name is Uttama-śloka. //Bhagavaty uttama-śloke bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭikī// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. Kṛṣṇa does not belong to this material world. Only the fools and rascals, they think of Kṛṣṇa having material body. //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. Kṛṣṇa is always in His spiritual body, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. Similarly, if we establish our bona fide relationship with the spiritual master, representative of Kṛṣṇa, immediately our connection with Kṛṣṇa becomes established.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"The cultivation of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not material. The Lord has generally three energies, namely, the external energy, the internal energy and the marginal energy. The living entities are called marginal energy and the material cosmic manifestation is the action of the external or material energy. Then..."

**Prabhupāda:**
So, //parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya// 13.65, //purport//]. The Supreme Absolute Truth, Personality of Godhead, has got innumerable, multi-energies. Out of that, learned scholars, devotees, they have divided the whole energy into three: external, internal and marginal. So the living entities, they are production of the marginal energy. The living entity is energy, //prakṛti,// not the //puruṣa. Puruṣa// is Kṛṣṇa.

We are all //prakṛtis,// all living entities. //Prakṛti// means predominated, and //puruṣa// means predominator. Just like we see, ordinarily, husband and wife, the husband is predominator and the wife is predominated, although there is no difference between husband and wife; they are one, divided into two. Similarly, //prakṛti// and //puruṣa,// they are one. They are not two.

It is explained by Svarūpa Dāmodara: //rādhā-kṛṣṇa-prakr..., praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād ekātmānāv api purā deha-bhedo gatau tau// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, They are one. But although They are one, They bifurcated Themselves as Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. So there is no difference between Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. Rādhā is the superior energy, or spiritual energy, and Kṛṣṇa is the energetic. Similarly, this material world is external energy. Similarly, the living entities, they're marginal energy---between the external and internal energy.

The living entities are called marginal energy because the living energy has to act under another energy, that either material energy or spiritual energy. So when the living entity is under spiritual energy, that is his normal condition, and when he's under the material energy, that is his abnormal condition.

We should always remember: material energy means forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. Just like in this material world, everything is there, but it is lacking in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You travel all over the world, you'll see there is profuse arrangement of sense gratification, but there is no arrangement for understanding Kṛṣṇa. This is called material energy. But if you bring in Kṛṣṇa in the so-called material energy, it becomes spiritual energy.

Therefore this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is awakening that spiritual energy of the living entity. //Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. The //mahātmā// and //durātmā,// what is the difference? The difference is the //durātmā// is under the influence of external energy. //Bahir-artha-māninaḥ. Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]].

When we are too much engrossed with the concept of bodily life---"I am this body," "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //kṣatriya//"---when we are influenced by the bodily concept of life, that is called material energy. And when we are influenced by the spiritual energy, we always think that "I am servant of the servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa." //Gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayoḥ dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]].

//Nāhaṁ vipro na ca nara-patir// [//Padyāvalī// 63]: "I am neither //brāhmaṇa// or //kṣatriya// or //vaiśya// and //śūdra// or //sannyāsī// or //brahmacārī.//" This, this is a verse given by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He denies any material designation, and He informs us also that //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. When we feel actually that "I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa," that is our liberation. //Hitvā anyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. This is //svarūpa.// When you are existing as servant of Kṛṣṇa, then you are //mukta,// liberated. You haven't got to endeavor separately for becoming free or liberated.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"Then there is the spiritual world, which is a manifestation of the internal energy. The living entities who are called marginal energies..., energy, perform material activities when acting under the inferior, external energy. And when they engage in activities under the internal, spiritual energy, their activities are called Kṛṣṇa conscious. This means that those who are great souls, or great devotees, do not act under the spell of material energy, but act instead under the protection of the spiritual energy."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. //Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. They do not act under the influence... Ordinary persons, they see that "Devotees are acting like us." No. Their activities are under the influence of spiritual energy. It, it, it looks similar like the //karmīs, jñānīs,// but //bhaktas// are different from //karmīs// and //jñānīs. Jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. They are not influenced by the tenets of //jñāna// and //karma.// They are influenced by activities which can satisfy Kṛṣṇa. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam. Anuśīlanam// activities, culture. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam.//

So they are simply engaged in Kṛṣṇa activities, although it looks similar to the ordinary activities. Therefore they misunderstand. Just like Arjuna. Arjuna is fighting, and another soldier is fighting the other side. But Arjuna's activities as soldier is devotional service, because he's trying to please Kṛṣṇa. Other side, they're fighting for their own interest, how to become victorious and take up the kingdom. That was their idea.

Here, Arjuna, he did not like to fight, but when he understood that "Kṛṣṇa desires this fighting," he engaged in it. Therefore his fighting was to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, not to satisfy his senses. As it is explained in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// to satisfy one's own senses, that is called //kāma,// and to satisfy the senses of Kṛṣṇa, that is called //prema.// That is the difference.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"Any activities done in devotional service, or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, are directly under the control of spiritual energy. In other words, energy is a sort of strength, and this strength can be spiritualized..."

**Prabhupāda:**
This is spiritual energy. Just like Arjuna is fighting. That energy is inspired by Kṛṣṇa. So Arjuna took it, "I must fight. Kṛṣṇa wants it. I must satisfy Kṛṣṇa." This is spiritual energy. Just see. The other party, they are also fighting in the same energy, but they have no Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So to act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is nothing wonderful. Simply you have to divert the energy for Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone has got energy, but when it is enacted for one's sense gratification, that is material. And when it is enacted for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, that is spiritual. Try to understand the difference between material and spiritual.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"In other words, energy is a sort of strength, and this strength can be spiritualized by the mercy of both the bona fide spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. We have to acquire this energy through the mercy of //guru// and Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa is within as //caitya-guru,// and when we are serious, He comes out as the spiritual master. //Śikṣā-guru, dīkṣā-guru.// So there is no difference between //śikṣā-guru// and //dīkṣā-guru// and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa manifests Himself externally as //śikṣā-guru// and //dīkṣā-guru.//

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī..."

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Pradyumna:**
"...Lord Caitanya states that it is a fortunate person who comes in contact with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. One who is serious about spiritual life is given by Kṛṣṇa the intelligence to come in contact with a bona fide spiritual master, and then, by the grace of the spiritual master, one becomes advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is the statement in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva
> guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

We are wandering in different species of life in different planets. //Brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva.// Not all; fortunate. One must be very much fortunate to come in contact with Kṛṣṇa and //guru.// So how that fortunate becomes possible? It is called //ajñāta-sukṛti. Sukṛti// and //duṣkṛti,// these two words are used in //Bhagavad-gītā. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. There is the word //duṣkṛti.// And //sukṛti. Catur-vidhā bhajanti māṁ sukṛti 'rjuna// [[books:bg:7:16|[Bg. 7.16]]].

So this //sukṛti,// this fortune, there is a chance which is called //ajñāta-sukṛti. Ajñāta-sukṛti// means just like Kṛṣṇa's representative is preaching all over the world, and if somebody comes in contact with that representative of Kṛṣṇa and satisfies him, he acquires some //ajñāta-sukṛti.// This is called //ajñāta-sukṛti.// He does not know what spiritual benefit he's achieving by serving the representative of Kṛṣṇa. He does not know. But he acquires it imperceptibly. This is called //ajñāta-sukṛti.// So when //ajñāta-sukṛti// is accumulated, then he becomes fortunate. That is called //kono bhāgyavān jīva// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]].

Just like Śukadeva Gosvāmī is describing about the cowherd boys who were playing with Kṛṣṇa:

> itthaṁ [satāṁ] brahma-sukhānubhūtyā
> dāsyaṁ gatānāṁ para-daivatena
> māyāśritānāṁ nāra-dārakeṇa
> sākaṁ vijahruḥ kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ
> [[books:sb:10:12:7-11|[SB 10.12.11]]]

//Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.// These boys who are playing with Kṛṣṇa as cowherd boys, they are not ordinary boys, Śukadeva Gosvāmī says. They are //kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.// For many, many life they accumulated their pious activities, and thus now they have got the association of Kṛṣṇa to play with Him. //Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.//

Similarly, these //ajñāta-sukṛti,// when they are accumulated... Just like you deposit in the bank four //annas,// two //annas.// In this way, one day it becomes one hundred rupees. Similarly, these //ajñāta-sukṛti,// when they're accumulated, that makes the fortune of a person to associate with //guru// and Kṛṣṇa.

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva
> guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

> mālī hañā sei bīja kara āropana
> śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye...
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:152|[Cc. Madhya 19.152]]]

So //bīja// means seed. //Bhakti-latā// seed. //Bhakti's// compared just like a creeper. The creeper does not stand alone; it embraces another tree, and then it grows. Similarly, //bhakti-latā, bhakti// always embraces the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and then grows. Therefore it is called //bhakti-latā.// So //bhakti-latā-bīja.// If one is fortunate, by accumulating this imperceptible good activities by association with devotees, then he gets this //bhakti-latā-bīja,// the seed of //bhakti-latā.//

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, //mālī hañā bīja kare āropana.// Just like you get some nice seed of rose flower. So if you sow it on the ground, just becoming a nice gardener, and pour water, then it gradually grows. So we have to take the //bhakti-latā-bīja// from the bona fide spiritual master and sow it within the heart, //taj-joṣaṇād āśv apavarga-vartmani śraddhā bhaktir anukramiṣyati// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]], and pour water. Just like simply sowing the seed is not your business is finished. You have to sow..., you have to pour water. So what is that pouring water?

> mālī hañā sei bīja kare āropana
> śravaṇa-kīrtana-jāle karaye secana
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:152|[Cc. Madhya 19.152]]]

This is the watering: hearing about Kṛṣṇa, chanting about Kṛṣṇa.

So you take the //bhakti-latā-bīja// from the spiritual master---that is called initiation---and develop it by pouring water of hearing and chanting. Then it will grow. One day it will grow so big that it will penetrate the walls of this universe. It will go to the spiritual world and gradually go to the Goloka Vṛndāvana, and catch up the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and then produce its fruits, and you will enjoy by eating the fruits.

Go on. What is the time?

**Devotee:**
Six o'clock, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol.// [end]
