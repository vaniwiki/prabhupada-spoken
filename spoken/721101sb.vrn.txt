**Prabhupāda:**

> bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiś
> chidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ
> kṣīyante cāsya karmāṇi
> dṛṣṭa evātmanīśvare
> [[books:sb:1:2:21|[SB 1.2.21]]]

This is complete liberated stage. In the previous verse it has been spoken, //bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ mukta-saṅgasya jāyate// [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]. The science of God, //bhagavat-tattva,// the science of Absolute Truth, becomes manifest to the liberated soul. We find sometimes that one man is posing to have very much advance in spiritual understanding, or a great devotee, but //mukta-saṅga...,// he's not //mukta-saṅga;// he cannot give up smoking //bīḍī.// You see?

These are the small tests. One who has actually tasted spiritual life, his unwanted things of life would at once diminish. There is no need. //Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt. Anartha. Anartha,// things which are not wanted, which has no meaning. So //mukta-saṅga// means no material attachment. That is //mukta-saṅga.// When one is actually liberated, these are the signs.

//Bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiḥ.// Our material life begins by a knot in the heart. What is that knot? That is sex desire. This is the knot. A man is hankering after a woman, and a woman is hankering after a man. This attachment is the beginning of material life. Everyone, not only human society. In animal society, in bird society, in beast society you'll find this sex attachment. This is the //hṛdaya-granthiḥ,// beginning.

Therefore, according to Vedic civilization, the first teaching to a student is to give him lesson how to become //brahmacārī.// How not to become attached in sex life, that is called //brahmacārī. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. //Tapasā,// to become //brahmacārī,// to become..., abstaining from sex life, it requires //tapasya.// It is not so easy thing. //Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa damena śamena.// One has to practice how to control the mind, how to control the senses. This is //brahmacarya. Tapasya.// It requires //tapasya.//

At the present moment, the students are, what to speak of //tapasya,// they are given all kinds of luxuries. So how there will be //brahmacārī?// It is not possible. Especially in the Western countries, the boys and girls, they are educated in one place, co-education, and they live in the same building, and there are so many things. You know better than me.

So there is no //brahmacārī.// There is no //brahmacarya.// That means the knot in the heart, sex desire, is more and more increased. It is not decreased. But if one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by practice one comes to the point of giving up all these unwanted things. //Chidyante, bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:21|[SB 1.2.21]]]. I have several times explained to you that this knot of the heart is the sex desire. //Puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. Sex desire, //mithunī-bhāvam etam.//

//Tayor hṛdaya-granthim.// And when they're actually united, that knot becomes more and more tight. But if one takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then gradually, //bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiḥ,// that knot, sex desire... That is the test whether one's sex desire has diminished. That is the test. //Bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiḥ.//

//Bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiś chidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ. Saṁśayāḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:21|[SB 1.2.21]]]. We are now in hazy conclusion what is our position. We do not know. We do not know what is God, what I am, what is our relationship. Everyone is speculating. There are..., therefore, there are so many parties: the //jñānī// party, the //yogī// party, the //karmī// party, generally. And within each and every party there are hundreds and thousands of parties. So when one actually becomes free from the knot, or the knot is cut off, the attachment for material desire is cut off, at that time he can understand what is his position. What is his position.

Therefore two things must go on in parallel line. One side, a person should cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and another side, he should try to give up all the unwanted things. That will help him. You cannot continue both the things. Just like when a person is diseased, he's given medicine. At the same times, he has to act: not to take this, not to take that. That is the way of treatment. Not that whatever you like, you can eat; whatever you like, you can do; at the same times you become spiritually advanced. This is all nonsense.

//Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. One has to practice //tapasya. Tapa. Tapa// means a little inconvenience, voluntarily accepting inconvenience. Just like //brahmacārī// lies down on the floor. A //sannyāsī// also, they follow the same practice as far as possible. Taking bath three..., thrice daily, and so many rules and regulation are there. But at the present age, it is not possible to follow all the rules and regulation, but at least everyone who is interested in advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness must rise early in the morning, before four, and take his bath and become cleansed, perform //maṅgala-ārātrika// and study.

These are //tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena ca damena va, tyāgena// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. //Tyāgena// means renouncement. I like something, but voluntarily I should give it up. That is called //tyāga.// Of course, one who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously, Kṛṣṇa helps him to become qualified in these matters. So //bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiś chidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:21|[SB 1.2.21]]].

Now unless one is taken to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness practice, he has got so many doubts: "Why I shall do this? Why I shall do that?" But when he is raised to the platform of goodness, as it is expressed, //mukta-saṅgasya jāyate, bhagavat-tattva-vijñānam// [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]], when he understands the science of God, automatically he becomes disinterested with these unwanted things. //Kṣīyante ca asya karmāṇi. Karmāṇi, karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām// [Bs. 5.54].

We are bound up in this material existence due to our //karma.// According to my past //karma,// I have got this body, and again, as we are acting in this body, I am preparing forward my next body. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. We have got varieties of body. Varieties of body. Not that because we are all human beings... We have got common factors---two hands, two legs, one head---but each body is different from the other body. You won't find one pair of body exactly of the same nature. That is not possible. Because everyone's //karma// is different. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa.// According to our //karma,// we get different types of body.

So we have to stop this //karma.// We have to stop this //karma.// How you can stop this //karma? Yajñārthe karmaṇaḥ anyatra karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. If we simply act for Kṛṣṇa, then we get rid of the resultant action of //karma. Yajñārthe karma.// Whatever you do, you do for Kṛṣṇa. //Yajñārthe. Yajña// means Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa's the origin of //viṣṇu-tattva.// So whatever you are ordered to do for Kṛṣṇa, you are not bound up by the //karma.// Otherwise, good or bad, you are bound up by the resultant action of //karma.//

So when one is actually in the liberated stage... Liberated stage means to remain fixed up in devotional service, //bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ.// Otherwise it is not possible. //Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]. You can stand liberated on the platform of devotional service. As soon as you deviate from devotional service, immediately the //māyā// is standing. She'll capture you.

You can see practically. There is sunshine, and just next to the sunshine, there is darkness, or shadow. So little deviation from the sunshine there is shadow. And little deviation from this shadow, you go to the sunshine. Both things are side by side, //māyā// and Kṛṣṇa. //Māyā// means absence of Kṛṣṇa. Shadow means absence of light, sunshine. So if you always keep in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no shadow of //māyā.//

> kṛṣṇa---sūrya-sama, māyā andhakāra
> yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:31|[Cc. Madhya 22.31]]]

Kṛṣṇa is just like sunshine, and //māyā// is just like darkness. So wherever there is sunshine, there cannot be any possibility of darkness. So you keep always yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then there is no possibility of //māyā.// And //māyā// means to engaged in fruitive activities.

//Tṛtīya-karma, karma-saṅgaḥ anya tṛtīya-śaktir iṣyate. Māyā...// So long we are in //māyā,// we have to engage ourself in fruitive activities, //karma.// Therefore here it is said, //kṣīyante ca asya karmāṇi.// One who is liberated, being engaged in devotional service, his //karma,// fruitive activities, stop immediately.

In the //Brahmā-saṁhitā// it is said,

> yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karma-
> bandhānurūpa-phala-bhājanam ātanoti
> karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājāṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.54]

//Yas tu indra.// Indra means the king of heaven. And there is another //indra, indra-gopa.// It is a..., it is an insect, very small. That is called //indra-gopa.// So it is said, "Beginning from that Indra, the king of heaven, down to this //indra,// the small insect," //yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karma,// "everyone is enjoying, suffering according at the //karma.//"

The, that Indra, the king of heaven, is... You can become the king of heaven, provided you have got a mass of pious activities; you are promoted. Just like if you have got sufficient education, you can become high-court judge. It is not very difficult. Similarly, this Indra, Candra, Brahmā, big, big demigods, they have got all these posts on account of their great pious activities. //Puṇya. Puṇya-karma.// Similarly, the hogs and dogs and other animals, they are due to the //pāpa-karma,// impious activities. So both of them are resultant action of our //karma.//

So everyone is suffering or enjoying the resultant action of his //karma---yas tv indra-gopam athavendram aho sva-karma-bandhānurūpa, bandhana//---as he's bound up by the resultant action of //karma. Bandhānurūpa-phala-bhājanam āta...// They are getting different results of their //karma.// It is very easy to understand.

But for the devotees it is said, //karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām// [Bs. 5.54]. //Bhakti-bhājām,// those who have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness in devotional service, their //karma// is cut off. There is no resultant action. Just like you know chickpeas. Chickpeas, if you sow on the ground, it will fructify into a plant. But the same chickpea, if it is fried and you sow on the ground, it will not fructify. So our //karma// should be fried up by devotional service. Then it will not produce any result. And Kṛṣṇa also says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].

So there is no resultant action of a devotee's activity. Therefore here it is said, //kṣīyante ca asya karmāṇi.// Unless you have completely finished your resultant action of //karma,// you cannot be promoted to the spiritual world. You have to accept a type of material body so long //karma// will go on.

Therefore in another place, //Bhāgavata,// it is said that people are engaged as //karmīs,// and Ṛṣabhadeva says //na sādhu manye.// One is engaged in //karma,// it is not very good.

> ...na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam
> asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ
> [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]

By //karma// only we are getting different types of body, although it is temporary. But as soon as we are encaged in this body, we become subject to threefold miseries of life.

So for a devotee, there is no more //karma,// or there is no more material body. Kṛṣṇa also confirms in the //Bhagavad-gītā, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. After giving up this body, a devotee, he does not get anymore birth in this material body. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.// In his spiritual body he comes back home, back to Godhead.

So the same thing is expressed here: //kṣīyante ca asya karmāṇi dṛṣṭa ātmani īśvare.// He sees, //ātmani dṛṣṭa,// he realized his relationship with God, //īśvare.// He realizes that "I am eternal servant of God, eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa." //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. He realizes it. And because he realizes it, he engages himself in that way. And that is the perfection of life.

[aside:] Read the purport.

**Pradyumna:**
"Attainment of scientific knowledge of the Personality of Godhead means seeing one's own self simultaneously. As far as the identity of the living being as spirit self is concerned, there are a number of speculations and misgivings. The materialist does not believe in the existence of the spirit self, and empiric philosophers believe in the impersonal feature of the..."

**Prabhupāda:**
This is doubt: whether there is soul or not. //Chidyante sarva-saṁśayāḥ.// There are so many doubts for the material scientist. Somebody says, "There must be something." Somebody says, "No, there is no soul; it is the combination of matter. The life symptoms come out." There are so many theories. So actually, when becomes enlightened by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, his all doubts are moved.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"...and empiric philosophers believe in the impersonal feature of the whole spirit without individuality of the living beings. But the transcendentalists affirm that the soul and the Supersoul are two different identities qualitatively one..."

**Prabhupāda:**
This is also another doubt. Because the impersonalists, they think, //ghaṭākāśa-poṭākāśa.// Just like the sky. The sky is within the pot, and the sky is outside the pot. So when the pot is broken, the inside sky becomes one with the outside sky. That is their theory. So these doubts are also dissipated when one comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That this //poṭākāśa// means the sky within the pot..., no, //ghaṭākāśa,// the sky within the pot, it cannot be made analogy with the sky in the pot and outside. Because they are individual souls.

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that they are part and parcel of God //sanātana,// eternally, not that they have been cut off. Just like the sky within the pot is walled by the wall of the pot, but actually we are not walled. We are individual. Every..., every one of us are individual. We are not surrounded by some material wall. This material wall is supposed to be this body. Actually, we are individual, and therefore, because we are individual, according to our individual //karma// we have got different types of body. So these are the doubts. When one become completely, I mean to say, cognizant with the Kṛṣṇa consciousness science, his all doubts are removed.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"There are many other theories, but all these different speculations are at once cleared off as soon as Śrī Kṛṣṇa is realized in truth by the process of //bhakti-yoga.// Śrī Kṛṣṇa is like the sun, and the materialistic speculations about the Absolute Truth are like the darkest midnight. As soon as the Kṛṣṇa sun is arisen within one's heart, the darkness of materialistic speculations about the Absolute Truth and the living beings is at once cleared off.

"In the presence of the sun, the darkness cannot stand, and the relative truths that were hidden within the dense darkness of ignorance become clearly manifested by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, who is residing in everyone's heart as the Supersoul. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]], the Lord says that in order to show special favor to His pure devotees, He personally eradicates the dense darkness of all misgivings by switching on the light of pure knowledge within the heart of a devotee."

**Prabhupāda:**
This is another advantage of the devotee. Because Kṛṣṇa shows a special favor to the devotee. Although He's equal to everyone, He's specially, I mean, inclined, favorable to the devotees. //Teṣām eva anukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ.// There... He takes special care. He says, //samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu// [[books:bg:9:29|[Bg. 9.29]]]. Although He's equal to everyone, still He's specially inclined to the devotees. For the devotees, he gives special instruction from within. //Yena mām upayānti te.// This is the special advantage of a devotee.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"Therefore, because of the Personality of Godhead taking charge of illuminating the heart of His devotee, certainly a devotee engaged in His service in transcendental love cannot remain in darkness."

**Prabhupāda:**
So there is no question that a devotee will remain in darkness. Sometimes it is argued that mostly devotees are not very much educated. It doesn't matter. This external, academic education has no value for spiritual advancement. So here it is said, //ahaṁ nāśayāmy ātma-bhāvasthaḥ// [[books:bg:10:11|[Bg. 10.11]]]. Kṛṣṇa is within everyone, and if every..., anyone is purified, Kṛṣṇa takes charge and He instructs. And who can be greater instructor than Kṛṣṇa? Therefore it is a wrong theory that devotees are ignorant. They're full of knowledge. If one is actually a devotee, there is no lack of knowledge. That's a fact.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"He comes to know everything of the absolute and the relative truths. The devotee cannot remain in darkness, and because a devotee is enlightened by the Personality of Godhead, his knowledge is certainly perfect. This is not the case for those who speculate on the Absolute Truth by dint of their own limited power of approach."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. One can speculate about the Absolute Truth to certain extent. Therefore, generally, these speculators becomes impersonalists. Because they cannot go beyond that. But that impersonal knowledge is not complete. As we have several times stressed on this point, one has to go further, onward: realization of Paramātmā, realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But they stop only in impersonal view. That's all.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"Such knowledge is called //paramparā,// or deductive knowledge, coming down from the authority to the submissive aural receiver, bona fide by service and surrender. One cannot challenge the authority of the Supreme and know Him also at the same time. He reserves the right of not being exposed to such a challenging spirit of an insignificant spark of the whole, subjected to the control of illusory energy. The devotees are submissive, and therefore the transcendental knowledge descends from the Personality of Godhead to Brahmā, and from Brahmā to his sons and disciples in succession.

"This process is helped by the Supersoul within such devotees. That is the perfect way of learning transcendental knowledge. This enlightenment perfectly enables the devotee to distinguish spirit from matter, because the knot of spirit and matter is untied by the Lord. This knot is called //ahaṅkāra,// and it falsely obliges a living being to become identified with matter.

"As soon as this knot is loosened, therefore, all the clouds of doubt are at once cleared off. He sees his master and fully engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, making a full termination of the chain of fruitive action. In material existence a living being creates his own chain of fruitive work and enjoys the good and bad effects of those actions life after life. But as soon as he engages himself in the loving service of the Lord, he at once becomes free from the chain of //karma.// All his actions no longer create any reaction."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Have //kīrtana.// [end]
