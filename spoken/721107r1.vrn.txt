====== Room Conversation ======

[Poor audio]

**Guru dāsa:**
[indistinct] was that there discussion important?

**Prabhupāda:**
Very important.

**Guru dāsa:**
Section of //Bhāgavata// was it there[?]. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
..that is the whole [indistinct] of //Bhāgavata. Bhāgavata// never becomes old, //nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]] [indistinct] [break]

**Guru dāsa:**
[indistinct] ... companion of the first three chapters is it not? The second question...

**Prabhupāda:**
So you’re going Agra?

**Guru dāsa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
When Dr. Kapoor phones...

**Guru dāsa:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
...tomorrow at 1 o’clock in the temple room.

**Guru dāsa:**
So he is coming here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Here, sitting here sit down. Come here... [break] what is the position of that palace? Any word from them?

**Acyutānanda:**
I think...

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Acyutānanda:**
Of course the king is the king [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
...but he is very very generous.

**Prabhupāda:**
Flatter him. [indistinct] flatter him. [indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
Next time.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
So but it’s a Trust, his all the properties now are now in the name of a Trust. The other members of the trust would like some. Someone has told us that to give them they mentioned something sometimes 15,000 and sometimes 25,000.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
But its not clear whether that would be the whole amount of money that will have to happen I think that if you give them some money to satisfy them [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] can pay very much [indistinct]

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes [indistinct] decorate the deities [indistinct] the temples or [indistinct] I have got [indistinct] to make first-class exhibition it’s already there. I have to take care of that, we shall paint very nicely [indistinct] very attractive painting [indistinct] to decorate. So [indistinct] if they want something [indistinct] 50,000, 70,000 then [indistinct] you can pay it. [indistinct]

**Devotee:**
They also want two or three rooms in the temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh no that cannot do. We welcome but you cannot usurp.

**Guru dāsa:**
He said that when he is not there we can use this, those rooms.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guru dāsa:**
But [indistinct] he wont.

**Prabhupāda:**
But one thing is that clearly [indistinct] deserve? That is not [indistinct] at all.

**Acyutānanda:**
You mean that [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
You can accommodate there but with a little gravity. That is not clearly [indistinct].

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct] room this land and [indistinct] for us.

**Prabhupāda:**
We can accommodate them but he gives us donation.

**Acyutānanda:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
.. And to satisfy the [indistinct] you cannot [indistinct].

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is inevitable. Now we can now... Whenever he comes we can provide four rooms, whenever he comes, this much [indistinct] but if we have allocated this four rooms [indistinct] always reserved for rooms.

**Acyutānanda:**
We can use them [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Guru dāsa:**
Whenever you come when you have left?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guru dāsa:**
Whenever [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
We shall pay. Whenever they come we shall have good facilities [indistinct] then if they decide then we can make additions and alterations that’s our program. So we better not spend so much money there...

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] residential quarters [indistinct] immediately decorate [indistinct] with a nice garden. [indistinct]

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] and for our devotee’s [indistinct]

**Guru dāsa:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
If they somehow or other [indistinct] that [indistinct] Mahārāja has come [indistinct] acknowledged [indistinct]

**Guru dāsa:**
Would it be [indistinct]?

**Prabhupāda:**
If he wants to go to London we have there. Got now residential building, everywhere he wants to go. [indistinct] foreign country. Los Angeles, New York, in Dallas. Oh Dallas we have got [indistinct] better than Los Angeles. You have not seen. [indistinct] [laughs] You have not seen house [indistinct] [laughs]

**Guru dāsa:**
Wouldn’t it be better with 26 2nd Ave. These lectures give me a feeling of those days.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Guru dāsa:**
These lectures [indistinct] just yourself and devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
In the beginning they were the first students. Acyutānanda, Brahmānanda [indistinct] Hayagrīva, Kīrtanānanda, later on Bhavānanda. I think [indistinct].

**Devotee:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Pradyumna was from the beginning?

**Bhavananda:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Pradyumna [indistinct] And our Hansadutta.

**Acyutānanda:**
When did Hayagrīva come? [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He got a son.

**Guru dāsa:**
Samba [indistinct] If the King travels to London he will want some spending money there.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] spending money? [indistinct] he can spend [indistinct] whatever he likes. You cannot give him [indistinct] this is not possible.

**Guru dāsa:**
If that is what he wants.

**Prabhupāda:**
That [indistinct] otherwise [indistinct] meat eating and drinking and gambling with a few lakhs then he can go to some hotel. [indistinct] temple [indistinct]

**Guru dāsa:**
He once [indistinct] mentioned [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Guru dāsa:**
Once he had mentioned that he wants to help him opening a foreign bank account.

**Prabhupāda:**
Immediately we shall help, immediately.

**Guru dāsa:**
But then he may want some contribution from our side for his palace? If he asks what should we offer?

**Prabhupāda:**
Minimum because we have to spend so much.

**Guru dāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] but whatever he asks I can pay. Nominal.

**Guru dāsa:**
Because his nominal, he mentioned nominal 25 //lakhs// at one time. So what do [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That we need direction. Immediately [indistinct] So what is your idea?

**Acyutānanda:**
Idea of [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
Or [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**

**Acyutānanda:**
Well 25,000 [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
If you want that you can give him $2,500. Immediately in any foreign country, either in England or New York or anywhere. I shall immediately send [indistinct] that will be very nice immediately we can open an account. [indistinct] ...bank balance then there will be no difficulty of [indistinct]

**Guru dāsa:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
A round trip ticket to America costs $1100. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
I’ll take care of that, first of all take care of this. He can be educated if he likes otherwise he can remain in London or he can remain in New York or in London village. Any big city [indistinct] there will be no charge for his boarding and lodging. Everything will be free and if he wants to be educated that also we can arrange.

**Acyutānanda:**
The Mahārāja would like [indistinct] religious.

**Prabhupāda:**

**Prabhupāda:**

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] 17?

**Prabhupāda:**
Then we can teach him Sanskrit and English. So let him donate without [indistinct] and we will take care of it. Let us make our programme nicely, we shall welcome him.

**Devotee:**
I would like to.. When we go up to Māyāpura [indistinct] I would like to ask the Mahārāja to come and see you [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That would be very nice.

**Devotee:**
I don’t think that you should [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
That we don’t know [break]. So instead of going to Agra you can go to Haripur.

**Guru dāsa:**
I go on the 18th, departure.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct].

**Devotee:**
The car is expected.

**Acyutānanda:**
The car is expected and if it doesn’t come then I will not be able to go to Broadwood[?] until after Delhi because the [indistinct] is not [indistinct]. This is the difficulty.

**Prabhupāda:**
