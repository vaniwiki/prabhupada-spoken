====== The Nectar of Devotion ======

**Pradyumna:**
[reading:] "...immediately terminates along with his body as soon as his life is over. Death is therefore taken as the representative of God for the atheistic class of men. The devotee realizes the presence of God by devotional service, whereas the atheist realizes the presence of God in the shape of death. At death everything is finished, and one has to begin a new chapter of life in a new situation, perhaps higher or lower than the last one. In any..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Bhagavad-gītā,// it is said, Kṛṣṇa says: //mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś ca aham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]. At the... By death, everything is taken away by Kṛṣṇa. So the modern civilization, they do not believe in the next birth. That is the basic mistake of the present civilization, that we get information that //tathā dehāntaraṁ prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. //Dehāntaram.//

Just like we are transmigrating, even in this span of life, from childhood to boyhood, from boyhood to youthhood, from youthhood to old age body. Therefore it is naturally to conclude that after this old body's finished, then we get another body, transmigration of the soul.

But there is no education, no enlightenment about this transmigration of the soul. But we can, if we think, ponder very deeply on this matter, how transmigration of the soul is taking place. And it is authorized, authorized statement of //Bhagavad-gītā: tathā dehāntaraṁ prāptir.//

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
> tathā dehāntaraṁ prāptir
> dhīras tatra na muhyati
> [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]

So this is the defect. The atheist class of men, they also see God. One..., everyone can see God, provided he has got eyes to see. Actually, //premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. Those who are //yogīs, bhakta-yogīs,// because they are in love with God, Kṛṣṇa, they are seeing every moment within their heart the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Anyone you love, you see always within your heart. Similarly, if you have love for God, Kṛṣṇa, then you can see Kṛṣṇa always.

That is called //yoga// system. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. //Yoginaḥ,// those who are //yogīs,// under meditation they see the Supreme Personality of Godhead within the heart. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ.//

So there are many evidences in the //śāstras. Yoga// means to see the Supreme Lord within the heart. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. //Īśvara,// the Supreme Lord, is situated in everyone's heart. One has to see. One has to develop that visionary power, how to see God within the heart. That is wanted. That is called //yoga// system. //Dhyānāvasthita.// Otherwise //īśvara// is there in everyone's heart.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad gata āntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

"The first-class //yogī// is he who is always seeing Me within his heart." //Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ.// There are different types of //yogīs.// The first-class //yogī// is he who can see Kṛṣṇa within his heart constantly, without any cessation. //Smartavyaṁ satato viṣṇuḥ vismārtavyaṁ na jātucit// [//Padma Purāṇa, Uttara-khaṇḍa//]. This is the process. One has to observe Viṣṇu within the heart always. //Smartavyaṁ satato viṣṇuḥ vismartavyam na...// This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One has to think of Kṛṣṇa or see Kṛṣṇa within the heart twenty-four hours. That is perfection of //yoga. Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatena āntarātmanā.//

But the atheist class of men, they do not see. They do not like to see. Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu and Prahlāda. Prahlāda is the son of Hiraṇyakaśipu; a great devotee. And the father is atheist. That is the struggle. This struggle between the atheist and theist, always existing. But God, Hiraṇya..., I mean to say, Nṛsiṁha-deva appeared. Nṛsiṁha-deva appeared for the solace of the devotee, Prahlāda, and for the death of the atheist. Both of them saw. Prahlāda saw Nṛsiṁha-deva as the most worshipable Deity, and Hiraṇyakaśipu saw the same person as death.

Therefore God can be seen by everyone, atheist or theist, but they see in a different way. The..., the theist, the devotee, sees God... Just like these devotees are worshiping the Lord, Kṛṣṇa, that "Here is Kṛṣṇa, Rādhārāṇī, and let us offer Him respect by offering //ārātrika, prasādam.//" They're seeing also. The atheist will say, "What this nonsense? Some idol they are worshiping."

The atheist will see, "What is this non...?" But that atheist will see God at the time of death, when He'll come as Nṛsiṁha-deva: immediately finished. All his assets, finished. With the body, the, everything he has possessed, the family or the house, the bank balance, this or that, everything is finished. Now he begins another chapter. He forgets.

Just like we forget at night when we see some dream, we forget our identity, that "I am this. I am that. I am lying on the bed. I've got this good apartment." No. Everything is finished. Again, this, when the dream is finished, we come to another dream: "Oh, this is my house. This is my family. This is my bank balance." This is going on: dream. One dream at night, one dream at daytime. But who is dreaming? That is the living entity.

So his business is different. Not dreaming, daytime dreaming and nighttime dreaming. He has to come to the actual platform. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If he takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is his actual life. Otherwise, he's in the dreamland. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]].

This is called //māyā,// illusion---nighttime dreaming and daytime dreaming. The nighttime dream... In this way, we are dreaming life after life: as human being, as animal, as tree, as aquatics. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati// [Padma Purāṇa]. So this evolutionary process is going on.

Therefore..., therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍo bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva
> guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

The living entity is wandering in this way, life after life---sometimes as human being, sometime as demigod, sometimes as //brāhmaṇa,// sometimes as //śūdra,// sometime as tree, sometime as insect, sometime as fish, so many. Sometime as birds. And in different planets also, not only in this planet. //Brahmāṇḍo.// Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //brahmāṇḍo,// within the universe, he is traveling according to his //karma.//

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtejyā yānti bhūtāni
> mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

So those who are in goodness, they are being promoted to the higher planetary systems of demigod.

> ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā
> madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ
> jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā
> adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ
> [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]

Those who are in goodness of material nature, they're being promoted to the higher planetary system. Those who are in passion, they are left within this Bhūr, Bhuvarloka. And those who are in ignorance, //jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti,// they..., one who has no systematic life, living like animal, so eating, sleeping like animal, //jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ,// they go down. This is going on.

Out of many millions of living entities, in this way, wandering all over the universe, one who is fortunate, he comes in contact with //guru// and Kṛṣṇa. //Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. Beginning of devotional service, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So that is real life.

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍo bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva
> guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

> mālī hañā sei bīja karaye āropaṇa
> śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye secana
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:152|[Cc. Madhya 19.152]]]

Just like if you get a nice flower seed, if you sow it and pour water, gradually it will grow. Similarly, this //bhakti-latā-bīja,// if one gets fortunately, through the association of devotees, and if he sows it within the heart and pour water gradually, by this way, //śravaṇa kīrtana,// this process which you are following, hearing and chanting...

This is called the process of pouring water. Then that //bhakti-latā-bīja,// that creeper, //bhakti-latā,// will grow. And, in due course of time, it will give you the fruit. The fruit is to be under the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is fruit.

Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
"In any field of activity---political, social, national or international---the results of our actions will be finished with the end of life. That is sure. //Bhakti-rasa,// however, the mellow relished in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, does not finish with the end of life."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is very important. Whatever we are doing in this life, everything will be finished with the end of the body. My position, my wealth, my family, my this or that---everything will be finished, because I'll have to accept another body. //Karmaṇā daiva netreṇa jantor deha upapattaye// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. This gross body will be finished. I'll have to accept another gross body.

But if you begin Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it will not be finished, because it is the business of the soul. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means the original consciousness: "I am Kṛṣṇa's. I am God's, part and parcel of God," this consciousness. At the present moment, being illusioned by different material designation, we are thinking in different way: "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //śūdra,//" "I am this," "I am that." These are all designation. And Kṛṣṇa consciousness means "I am Kṛṣṇa's." //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi. So 'ham.// "I am as good as Kṛṣṇa," or "I am Kṛṣṇa's. I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa." This consciousness is required to invoke.

That is the prime objective of human life. Now we are in different consciousness. So //bhakti// means //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. One has to become free from all these designations: "I am this," "I am that," this bodily concept of life. //Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke// [SB 10.84.13].

I am identifying myself with this body. This is condemned in the //śāstra: sa eva go-kharaḥ.// One who identifies himself with this body, he's no better than the cows and the asses. //Sa eva go-kharaḥ.//

So Kṛṣṇa consciousness means one is not identifying himself with this material body. He is identifying himself in his original, constitutional position, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.//

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

//Mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām.// After being liberated from all these designation, one begins his devotional service, devotional life. And Kṛṣṇa says, "If one wants to know Me, then he must accept." //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. //Tattvataḥ.// If one wants to know Kṛṣṇa, God, as He is, then he has to accept the process of devotional service. //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti.//

//Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhakti-yogena// [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]]. There is another verse in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ.// By practicing the //bhagavad-bhakti-yoga, bhagavad-bhakti-yoga prasanna manaso,// one has to become first of all joyful by identifying himself with the spirit. //Brahmā bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]].

Then, when he becomes joyful, he understands that "I am not this material body; I am spirit soul. I am not American, I am not Indian, I'm not //brāhmaṇa,// I am not this, this, this, so many things... No, I am spirit soul. I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa." This is called //brahma-bhūtaḥ.//

//Evaṁ prasanna-manaso.// When one becomes //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// self-realized, at that time, he becomes //prasanna-manaso,// joyful. //Na śocati na kāṅkṣati:// he has no more lamentation or hankering. //Evaṁ prasanna.// In this state of life, //prasanna-manaso, evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:20|[SB 1.2.20]]], by practicing //bhagavad-bhakti yoga, bhagavat-tattva-vijñānaṁ mukta-saṅgasya jāyate.//

At that time, one can understand what is the science of God, //bhagavat-tattva.// It is not a sentiment; it is a //vijñāna,// science. //Bhagavad-tattva-vijñāna.// So who can understand this //bhagavad-tattva-vijñāna,// science? //Mukta-saṅga.// One who is liberated from this material contamination, he can understand.

Therefore devotees who are constantly engaged in the loving service of the Lord, they are liberated. //Māṁ ca avyabhicāriṇi bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. Anyone who is engaged in devotional service unadulterated, without any motive, unadulterated:

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanam...
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

He's liberated. These activities of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is..., it appears to be ordinary activities, but that is liberated activity. Those who cannot understand the activities in liberation, //nirviśeṣavādi,// they think that in the conditioned state of life, there are activities; when one becomes liberated, he has no more activities---he becomes dumb. No. Actual activities begins in liberated...

Just like a man, a diseased fellow, diseased fellow, lying on the bed, he's also eating. He's also sleeping. He's also passing stool, urine. But that is not real activity. When he becomes cured of the disease, come to his healthy life, and then again he walks, he eats, he sleeps, that is another, mean, a position of eating, sleeping.

But one who cannot understand the liberated activities, they are shuddered. As soon as they think of activities, they think, "Oh, the activities, they, the..." The same patient who is suffering for, suppose from birth, he cannot understand that there is activities after being cured of this disease. He cannot understand. He thinks activity means lying down on the bed and drinking all bitter medicine and pass stool and urine by using, what is called, that...?

**Devotees:**
Bed pan. Bed pan.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bed pan. [chuckles] He's thinking like that. He has no idea there is better activities, better sleeping, better eating. That he cannot understand. Therefore //śūnyavādi.// They want to make zero. "These activities are giving me so much trouble. Make it zero." Just like sometimes one cannot tolerate the pains of diseased condition. Sometimes they commit suicide---stop these activities.

So the //śūnyavādi,// they are like that---committing suicide; stop these activities. But they do not know that there is activities. There are... After being cured of this material disease, when one is healthy... That healthy activities are the devotional activities. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //māṁ ca avyabhicāriṇi yogena yaḥ sevate. Sevate// means there is activities. It is not stoppage of activities. //Sevate. Sevate// means giving service. Giving service is not stopping activities. But that is a different type of activities, healthy activities.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,

> māṁ ca avyabhicāriṇi
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

He's //brahma-bhūtaḥ.// He's self-realized. Self-realized. That is //mukti. Muktir hitvā anyathā rūpaṁ svārupeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. //Mukti// does not mean stopping activities. That is not //mukti.// That is suicidal. You are living entity. How you can stop? That is not possible. They say that, Māyāvādī philosophers, they say to become desireless. That..., you cannot be desireless, because you are living entity. How you can stop your desires? But you have to rectify; you have to purify your desires.

Now we are desiring simply for sense gratification, to lord it over the material nature. That is your desire. And, and when this desire is purified, then you'll desire that how everything should be engaged in the service of God. Now I am trying to become God, lord it over the material nature. But when my desires are purified, then I shall understand that everything belongs to God, therefore everything should be dovetailed in the service of God. That is liberation. //Muktir hitvā anyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa...// This is //svarūpa.//

Therefore //śūnyavādi,// or //nirviśeṣa-vādi,// they are not liberated. They are still in //māyā. Vimukta-māninaḥ.// In the //Bhāgavata// it is said that they are thinking, concocting, that they have become liberated. Actually they are not liberated. //Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ. Māninaḥ.//

Say somebody thinks that "I'm the proprietor of all the banks." Let him think like that. But that does not mean he has become the proprietor of the banks. That is a different thing. Similarly, one may think that "I have become liberated," but actually he's not liberated. Liberated is he who is engaged in the service of the Lord. He's liberated.

Nobody's liberated. //Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. Just like they are going to the moon planet. They have got very high speed sputniks. Simply riding on, boarding on high-speed sputnik does not mean he has gone to the moon planet. Actually he has to go there and live there. Then it is successful. But what they are doing? They are going and coming back. They are going and coming back.

Similarly, //āruhya kṛcchṛeṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanti adhaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. If you have no stay in the higher status of life, //brahma anubhūti,// then you'll have to come back again. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa. Kṛcchreṇa// means by practicing severe austerities, penances, one may go up to the Brahman effulgence, //paraṁ padam.// That is called //paraṁ padam.// But because there is no stay... Just like in the sky, you may go with high speed, but if you cannot stay in some planet, you'll have to come back again. Similarly,

> āruhya kñcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ
> patanti adhaḥ anādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ

Because they cannot get shelter under the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, they have to come down again to these material activities. And we have seen practically, so many big, big //sannyāsīs,// they give up this material world, take //sannyāsa// to understand Brahman, but because they could not understand Brahman, they again come to open hospital and schools. That is their business. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanti adhaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]].

But one who is engaged in the devotional service of the Lord, he does not come to these material activities again. The, the factual evidence... Just this, these boys, these European, American boys. Who could enjoy material life better than them? They were all enjoying.

But they have given up everything. They are no more going back to that status of life. //Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 2.59]]]. They have found something better. Therefore they're not going to again that life of meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication, smoking and drinking. No. They are not, no more going. Give them bribe also: "You come to again to that stage." Will you go?

**Devotees:**
No. No.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. They'll never go. This is called liberation. This is called liberation. Simply by thinking, "I have become liberated," and I am handicapped by so many bad habits, that is not liberation. That is simply mental concoction. Real liberation is //bhakti-yoga.//

Thank you very much. That's all. [end]
