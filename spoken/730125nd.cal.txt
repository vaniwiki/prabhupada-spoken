====== The Nectar of Devotion ======

**Mādhavānanda:**
[reading] "...by certain convictions derived by his own arguments and decisions. Then another person, who may be a greater logician, will nullify these conclusions and establish another thesis. In this way the path of argument will never be safe or conclusive. The //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// recommends, therefore, that one follow in the footsteps of the authorities."

**Prabhupāda:**
So, to make progress in devotional service, one cannot manufacture anything. The authoritative statements of //ācāryas,// that we'll have to follow. //Mahājana yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. We should not manufacture, invent anything. As they are stated in the //śāstras,// confirmed by spiritual master and //ācāryas,// that will be accepted. Nobody can say, "I think devotional service should be like this." No. Therefore spiritual master is the guidance. He is the representative of the //ācāryas.// In this way we should make progress, not by concoction.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"Here is a general description of devotional service given by Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī in his //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.// Previously, it has been stated that devotional service can be divided into three categories---namely devotional service in practice, devotional service in ecstasy and devotional service in pure love of God. Now Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī proposes to describe devotional service in practice.

"Practice means employing our senses in some particular type of work. Therefore devotional service in practice means utilizing our different sensory organs in service to Kṛṣṇa. Some of the senses are meant for acquiring knowledge and are..., and some are meant for executing the conclusions of our thinking, feeling and willing. So practice means employing both the mind and the senses in practical devotional service. This practice is not for developing something artificial. For example, a child learns or practices to walk. This walking is not unnatural. The walking capacity is there originally in the child, and simply by a little practice he walks very nicely.

"Similarly, devotional service to the Supreme Lord is the natural instinct of every living entity. Even uncivilized men like the aborigines offer their respectful obeisances to something wonderful exhibited by nature's law, and they appreciate that behind some wonderful exhibition or action there is something supreme. So this consciousness, though lying dormant in those who are materially contaminated, is found in every living entity. And, when purified, this is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
This obedience, the sense of obedience to higher authorities, to love somebody, these propensities are there in everyone. Even a child, we have seen, when there is //saṅkīrtana,// they also clap their hands. They also try to dance. This is natural. So this has to be little organized. That is called practice. Otherwise the things are there, dormant. Sometimes by bad association that dormant propensities are cut down. They forget. The present situation is like that. The so-called material advancement has curbed down the dormant propensities for loving God, or Kṛṣṇa.

Therefore Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says that //jaḍa-vidyā saba māyāra vaibhava. Jaḍa-vidyā saba māyāra vaibhava, tomāra bhajane bādhā// [//Vidyāra Vilāse// 3]. The more artificially we make advancement of material civilization, the more we become away from devotional service. Practically we can see. People are engaged in developing their material resources. Everyone is busy. And we, if our men approach, then they think it is simply waste of time. "All right. They're asking something. Give them some money. Let them go away, and let my business be done nicely." So this is the propensities observed by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura: //jaḍa-vidyā saba māyāra vaibhava.// The more we advance in material civilization, we become backward in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

Our principle is, therefore, to minimize the artificial necessities of life, as much as possible. //Nirbandhe kṛṣṇa-sambandhe. Anāsaktasya viṣayān// [Brs. 1.2.255]. We should eat, sleep, not for material comfort. But eating is required. Without eating, we cannot live. Sleeping is required, to give rest for some time. For that purpose we shall eat, sleep... //Nirbandha kṛṣṇa-sambandhe. Anāsaktasya viṣayān.// We should not be attached. That will make our spiritual progress firm.

[aside:] Yes. Go on. Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"There are certain prescribed methods for employing our senses and mind in such a way that our dormant consciousness for loving Kṛṣṇa will be invoked as much as the child, with a little practice, can begin to walk. One who has no basic walking capacity cannot walk by practice. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be aroused simply by practice. Actually there is no such practice. When we wish to develop our innate capacity for devotional service, there are certain processes which, by our accepting and executing them, will cause that dormant capacity to be invoked. Such practice is called //sādhana-bhakti.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sādhana-bhakti, rāga-bhakti, prema-bhakti//---these three division. So first of all we have to accept //sādhana-bhakti.// Means practicing.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"Every living entity under the spell of material energy is known to be in an abnormal condition of madness. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, 'Generally the conditioned soul is mad because he is always engaged in activities which are the causes of bondage and suffering.' Such spirit soul in its original condition is joyful, blissful, eternal and full of knowledge. Only by his implication in material activities has he become miserable, temporary and full of ignorance.

"This is due to //vikarma. Vikarma// means actions which should not be done. Therefore we must practice //sādhana-bhakti//---which means to offer //maṅgala-ārātrika// [Deity worship] in the morning, to refrain from certain material activities, to offer obeisances to the spiritual master and to follow many other rules and regulations which will be discussed here one after another. These practices will help one to become cured of madness. As a man's mental disease is cured by the directions of a psychiatrist, so this //sādhana-bhakti// cures the conditioned soul of his madness under the spell of //māyā,// material illusion."

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyone who is not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to be taken as crazy, or mad.

> piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya
> māyā-grasta jīvera se dāsa upajaya
> [Prema-vivarta 6.2]

Just like when a man becomes ghostly haunted, he does something abnormal. He cannot recognize his own men. He calls his father by ill names. So many disturbances. So //nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]. They are so mad that they are engaged only in sinful activities.

There are three //karmas: karma, akarma, vikarma. Karma// does not mean whatever you like, you can do. No. //Karma// means prescribed duties. //Janma karma,// uh, //guṇa karma.// As you are under the spell of certain material modes of nature... Someone is under the modes of goodness, his //karma// will be different from the person who is under the spell of the modes of ignorance. That will be decided by the teacher or by the //ācāryas.// They are described in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that one who is under the spell of goodness, his qualities, his symptoms, are like this: //satya śama dama titikṣa// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. Similarly, one who is under the spell of passion, his symptoms are like this.

Just like a diseased man... If you go to a physician, by your symptoms he can understand that you have got a certain type of disease and he gives you the right medicine. Similarly, in the //Bhagavad-gītā// you'll find who is under the spell of the modes of ma..., uh, yes, goodness. If he's very sober, intelligent, can understand things as they are, they are to be understood in the modes of goodness. Those who are very much passionate, simply wants to enjoy sense enjoyment, they are in the modes of passion. And those who are lazy, very fond of sleeping, //nidrālasya,// he's to be understood in the modes of ignorance. These are the symptoms. And according to the modes, they act. Therefore //bhakti// is not prohibited to either of them. Either in goodness or passion or ignorance---it doesn't matter. Anyone can take to devotional service, //sādhana-bhakti,// provided he agrees to be guided by the direction of the spiritual master. //Bhakti// is transcendental. It doesn't matter whether one is in goodness, passion or ignorance. Anyone can take.

That is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā: māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. //Pāpa-yonayaḥ// means the lowest part of ignorance. So Kṛṣṇa recommends that anyone, even in //pāpa-yoni---striya, vaiśyās tathā śūdrās... Stri,// women, and //vaiśya// and //śūdra,// they're also considered not very in higher position. But Kṛṣṇa says all of them, if they take to real path of devotional service under the direction of spiritual master, then that is //sādhana-bhakti.// To act under the direction of spiritual master... Spiritual master directs means he knows //śāstra.// According to the direction of //śāstra// or //ācāryas,// he gives direction. And if we follow, that is called //sādhana-bhakti.// That is called practice.

In the beginning, //sādhana-bhakti// must be there. Then when you get attachment for Kṛṣṇa, that is called //rāga-bhakti.// And the more you increase your attachment for Kṛṣṇa, then it will come to the stage of //prema-bhakti.// You don't become //kṛṣṇa-premī// all of a sudden: "Now I have become //kṛṣṇa-premī.// Let me cry." And then, after crying, "Oh, my throat is now dried up. Give me cigarette." This kind of //bhakti// has no value. You'll see so many //sahajiyās,// professional: they can cry, but they have no love for Kṛṣṇa. I have seen one professional reciter. He can cry, and he gathers many people around him. But by his writing, by his speech, we can understand that he has no faith in Kṛṣṇa. In Bombay I have seen. When he writes...

//Tāvac śobhate mūrkha yāvān kiñcin na bhāṣate.// A //mūrkha,// a rascal, can be beautiful as long as he does not speak or write. But as soon as one speaks and writes, we can understand what is the //locus standus// of that person. Simply crying will not help. One who will cry for Kṛṣṇa, he will never come down to the material platform. That crying is not so easy. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to cry, He also said, "I am crying for make-show." So crying automatically comes when actually if we are in //prema-bhakti.// But we have to go that stage gradually, not by imitating. //Sādhana-bhakti, rāga-bhakti,// then //prema-bhakti.//

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"Nārada Muni mentions this //sādhana-bhakti// in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Seventh Canto, First Chapter, thirtieth verse. He says there to King Yudhiṣṭhira, 'My dear King, one has to fix his mind on Kṛṣṇa by any means.' This is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is the duty of the //ācārya,// the spiritual master, to find the ways and means for his disciple to fix his mind on Kṛṣṇa. That is the beginning of //sādhana-bhakti.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is very important thing. Some way or other, one has to fix up his mind in Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa is not stereotyped. It is general. If you want to serve Kṛṣṇa, there are so many ways. Just like in our Society: somebody is painting, somebody is writing on typewriter, sometime somebody is engaged in propagating or selling the magazine or editing the magazine. So many different duties. So it is..., it is the spiritual master's business to see the disciple, in which way he has got the tendency. And he tries to utilize his natural tendency in the matter of serving Kṛṣṇa.

One has got tendency for a certain thing. That tendency can be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service also. It is not difficult. Simply it requires training and guidance. //Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya, saṁsiddhi labhate naraḥ// [[books:bg:18:46|[Bg. 18.46]]]. One has got a particular tendency to work. By that work, if it is nicely done, you can satisfy Kṛṣṇa. Our only business is to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. //Svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. Whatever business you may have, it doesn't matter. Whatever talent you have got, it doesn't matter. If you can utilize that talent for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, then your life is successful.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given us an authorized program for this purpose, centered around the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
The general practice by everyone, whatever tendency he may have differently, but the general platform is to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// That will pave the way for everyone.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"This chanting has so much power that it immediately attaches one to Kṛṣṇa. That is the beginning of //sādhana-bhakti.// Somehow or other, one has to fix his mind on Kṛṣṇa. The great saint Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, although a responsible king, fixed his mind on Kṛṣṇa, and similarly anyone who tries to fix his mind in this way will very rapidly make progress in successfully reviving his original Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

"Now this //sādhana-bhakti,// or practice of devotional service, can also be divided into two parts. The first part is called regulative principles. One has to follow these different regulative principles by the order of the spiritual master, or on the strength of authoritative scriptures, and there can be no question of refusal. That is called //vaidhi,// or regulated. One has to do it without any argument.

"Another part of //sādhana-bhakti// is called //rāgānugā. Rāgānugā// refers to the point at which, by following the regulative principles, one becomes a little more attached to Kṛṣṇa and executes devotional service out of natural love. For example, a person engaged in devotional service may be ordered to rise early in the morning and offer //ārātrika,// which is a form of Deity worship. In the beginning, by the order of his spiritual master, one rises early in the morning and offers //ārātrika,// but then he develops real attachment. When he gets this attachment he automatically tries to decorate the Deity and prepare different kinds of dresses and thinks of different plans to execute his devotional service nicely. Although it is within the category of practice, this offering of loving service is spontaneous.

"So the practice of devotional service, //sādhana-bhakti,// can be divided into two parts---namely, regulative and spontaneous. Rūpa Gosvāmī defines the first part of devotional practice, or //vaidhi-bhakti,// as follows: 'When there is no attachment or no spontaneous loving service to the Lord, and one is engaged in the service of the Lord simply out of obedience to the order of the spiritual master or in pursuance of the scriptures, such obligatory service is called //vaidhi-bhakti.//'

"These principles of //vaidhi-bhakti// are also described in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Second Canto, First Chapter, verse 35 [[books:sb:2:1:35|[SB 2.1.35]]], where Śukadeva Gosvāmī instructs the dying Mahārāja Parīkṣit as to his course of action. Mahārāja Parīkṣit met Śukadeva Gosvāmī just a week before his death, and the King was perplexed as to what should be done before he was to pass on. Many other sages also arrived there, but no one could give him the proper direction. Śukadeva Gosvāmī, however, gave this direction to him as follows: 'My dear King, if you want to be fearless in meeting your death next week [for actually everyone is afraid at the point of death], then you must immediately begin the process of hearing and chanting and remembering God.'

"If one can chant and hear Hare Kṛṣṇa and always remember Lord Kṛṣṇa, then he is sure to become fearless at death, which may come at any moment."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is our prescription, that "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// without any stop." And even death comes... Death may come at any moment, but if at the time of death, somehow or other you can utter "Kṛṣṇa" or remember Kṛṣṇa, as soon as you utter the name of Kṛṣṇa, you remember Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, everything. So let us chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// twenty-four hours. There is no, I mean to say, impediment. Anyone. //Ahaituky apratihatā.// Nobody can check it. If you are determined that "I shall always chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,//" nobody can check.

But we do not feel so much attached to the chanting. Therefore it is checked. So therefore we have fixed up a certain rounds. Just like we have given to you sixteen rounds. At least, as a regulative principle, you must chant. Then gradually we may increase and automatically chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// That will be very good approach.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"In the statements of Śukadeva Gosvāmī it is said that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Śukadeva recommends that one should always hear about Kṛṣṇa. He does not recommend that one hear and chant about the demigods. The Māyāvādīs [impersonalists] say that you can chant any name, either that of Kṛṣṇa or those of the demigods, and the result will be the same. But actually this is not a fact. According to the authorized version of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// one has to hear and chant about Lord Viṣṇu [Kṛṣṇa] only."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ,// it is specifically mentioned. Not that, as the Māyāvādīs say, that you can chant any name. No. //Śāstra// says, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.//

> śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ
> smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam
> arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ
> sakhyam ātma-nivedanam
> [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]

So, as it is recommended by the //śāstras,// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare, we should chant this. Why other demigods' name? The Māyāvādī philosopher, they misguide us. //Śāstra// says, //harer nāma, harer nāma, harer nāma.// Three times. Only the name of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, Hari.

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalaṁ
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

There are many places. //Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet// [SB 12.3.51]. This is said by Śukadeva Gosvāmī. Simply by chanting this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// one becomes liberated and transferred to the spiritual world. //Kalau doṣa-nidhe rājann hy asti eka mahān guṇaḥ.// In this age, there are so many faults, but there is one sublime benefit, that is this, that simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// one becomes freed from this material world and is transferred to the spiritual world.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"So Śukadeva Gosvāmī has recommended to Parīkṣit Mahārāja that in order to be fearless of death one has to hear and chant and remember the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, by all means. He also mentions that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is //sarvātmā. Sarvātmā// means the Supersoul of everyone. Kṛṣṇa is also mentioned as Īśvara, the Supreme Controller, who is situated in everyone's heart. Therefore if some way or other we become attached to Kṛṣṇa, He will make us free from all danger.

"In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that anyone who becomes a devotee of the Lord is never vanquished. Others, however, are always vanquished. Vanquished means that after getting this human form of life a person does not come out of the entanglement of birth and death and thus misses his golden opportunity. Such a person does not know where he is being thrown by the laws of nature.

"Suppose one does not develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this human form of life. He will be thrown into the cycle of birth and death involving 8,400,000 species of life, and his spiritual identity will remain lost. One does not know whether he is going to be a plant or a beast or a bird or something like that, because there are so many species of life.

"The recommendation of Rūpa Gosvāmī for reviving our original Kṛṣṇa consciousness is that somehow or other we should apply our minds to Kṛṣṇa very seriously and thus become fearless of death. After death we do not know our destination because we are completely under the control of the laws of nature. Only Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is controller over the laws of nature.

"Therefore if we take shelter of Kṛṣṇa seriously, there will be no fear of being thrown back into the cycle of so many species of life. A sincere devotee will surely be transferred to the abode of Kṛṣṇa, as affirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
We are under the control of the material nature. Everyone can realize it. Nobody can be free. But the process of freedom is also stated there: //daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā, mām eva ye prapadyante// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. If anyone takes to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, surrenders there, and be engaged in His service, then these laws of nature will be slackened, or almost nil. //Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām// [Bs. 5.54]. These are the statements of the //śāstras.// Laws of material nature means //karma.// You act in a certain way and you get the result, good or bad; that is called //karma. Sat-karma// or //asat-karma.// Actually everything is //asat-karma. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]].

So even taking..., accepting that good work is nice, but it is also bondage. Suppose you give in charity. So the laws of nature is that if you give one by charity, you get four. So now to accept that four, you have to take birth again. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa sakali viṣera bandha// [//Prema-bhakti-candrikā//]. //Karma-kāṇḍa// means if you act very piously, next life you get good birth, good opulence, money, //janma iśvarya-śruta,// good education, beautiful body. These are the resultant action of //sat-karma.// And //asat-karma// means you become poor, ugly, without any education, no riches, always hungry. These are the results of //asat-karma.// So this is called //karma-kāṇḍa.// And //jñāna-kāṇḍa// means to try to merge into the existence of the Lord, which, even if we do, but because you are under the impression of impersonalism, you again fall down.

So both by the action of //karma-kāṇḍa// and //jñāna-kāṇḍa// one is not secure. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //sakali viṣera bandha.// Poison, either in a golden pot or in iron pot, it is the..., the effect is the same. So //bhakti// is neither for //karma-kāṇḍa// nor for //jñāna-kāṇḍa. Jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. That is real //bhakti.//

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

//Bhakti// should not be contaminated by //karma// and //jñāna. Bhakti// should remain pure. Then the result will be very quick and nice.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"In the //Padma Purāṇa// also the same process is advised. There it is said that one should always remember Lord Viṣṇu. This is called //dhyāna,// or meditation---always remembering Kṛṣṇa. It is said that one has to meditate with his mind fixed upon Viṣṇu. //Padma Purāṇa// recommends that one always fix his mind on the form of Viṣṇu by meditation and not forget Him at any moment. And this state of consciousness is called //samādhi,// or trance."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Satatam, satataṁ smartavyaḥ viṣṇuḥ.// This is the injunction. One should always remember Viṣṇu, the form of Viṣṇu. That is possible only when we have enhanced a little in the path of loving Kṛṣṇa, or Viṣṇu. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38].

So everything is possible provided we are serious. Then everything is possible.

[aside:] Go on.

Otherwise why Rūpa Gosvāmī has taken so much trouble in the matter of giving us //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// quoting from so many, innumerable //śāstras? Sad-dharma-pravarta. Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-pravartakau// [//Ṣaḍ Gosvāmy Aṣṭaka//]. The Gosvāmīs were so compassionate with the fallen human society that he, especially Rūpa Gosvāmī... All the Gosvāmīs, they first of all searched out all the datas of spiritual life and quoted them, in each and every line. Sufficiently he quoted from //śāstras.// This is the business of //sādhu. Sādhu-śāstra-guru.// They will act in the same way. There is no difference of opinion. //Sādhu-śāstra-guru-vākya tinete kariyā aikya.// One has to see a //sādhu// by corroborating his statement according to the //śāstras// or another //sādhu.//

**Mādhavānanda:**
"We should always try to mold the activities of our lives in such a way that we will constantly remember Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like in the temple. Here, every business is in connection with Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, what is the difference between this house and the next door? There, Kṛṣṇa is not there. And this, just in this door, everything is Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference between ordinary house and temple. Ordinary house, they're also busy in purchasing things from the market, cooking them and eating very nicely, sufficiently. But according to //śāstra,// they're eating all sins. //Ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt// [[books:bg:3:13|[Bg. 3.13]]]. //Bhuñjate te aghaṁ pāpam.// The... In a temple, same business is going on---same marketing, same cooking, same eating, everything is going on---but in relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Where this relationship is there, always, Kṛṣṇa, then every house becomes a temple. That is required. We are simply setting example that how we can execute our daily affairs in connection with Kṛṣṇa. That is our propaganda.

So every //gṛhastha,// every house, where is the difficulty? Everyone can install the Deity. All the family members can gather together, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// and read //śāstras,// as we are doing in this temple. But the present tendency is that we have..., they have got sufficient time to smoke, they have got sufficient time for playing cards, they have sufficient time for drinking, going to the cinema, going to the sports. But they have no time for developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the difficulty. As soon as you talk of them, talk to them about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they'll immediately say, "Sir, we have no time." And for other things, the paraphernalia of Kali-yuga, they have got enough time. They'll read newspapers, all full of rascal news: "One man has stolen, one man has kidnapped, one man has stabbed." These news, he'll very, with great interest he'll read. And as soon as we present //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// "Oh, this is not good." This is the position.

Therefore there is a great necessity for pushing on this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. That is the best welfare activity to the human society. All of them, they are rascals. //Abodha-jāta.// In the //śāstra// it is said, //parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāta.// They are being defeated by the onslaught of material nature. These rascals, they do not know. They are thinking they have become great leaders, philanthropist, nationalist, politician, scientist, philosopher---but they're killing themselves and others. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇu// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. They do not know how to make progress.

Therefore a person who has understood little value of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he should take this movement very seriously and distribute to the fallen souls. That is the best work. That is the best work.

[aside:] Go on.

**Mādhavānanda:**
"Whether one concentrates his mind on the four-handed form of Viṣṇu or on the form of two-handed Kṛṣṇa, it is the same. The //Padma Purāṇa// recommends: somehow or other, always think of Viṣṇu without forgetting Him under any circumstances. Actually, this is the most basic of all regulative principles. For, when there is an order from a superior about doing something, there is simultaneously a prohibition. When the order is that one should always remember Kṛṣṇa, the prohibition is that one should never forget Him. Within this simple order and prohibition, all regulative principles are found completely. This regulative principle is applicable to all //varṇas// and //āśramas,// the castes and occu..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Regulative principles are meant for everyone---all //varṇas// and //āśramas.// Not that "I am now //sannyāsī.// I have got the highest platform. Therefore regulative principle is not meant for me. It is for the //kaniṣṭha.//" This is rascaldom. //Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyā na tyājyam. Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ. Tapasya.// Following the regulative principle means //tapasya.// So "I have renounced the world. Renounced. I have become //sannyāsī,// renounced the world..." That doesn't mean I have renounced all these things, //yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyā.// No. These things are not to be renounced.

//Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyā na tyajyam// [[books:bg:18:5|[Bg. 18.5]]]. They are not to be renounced. //Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyā pāvanāni manīṣiṇām.// Even if you are..., you have become a great saintly person, still you should consider, continue //yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyā.// This is the injunction of the //śāstra.// It should not be given up at any stage. //Pāvanāni manīṣiṇām// [[books:bg:18:5|[Bg. 18.5]]].

All right. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.
