**Prabhupāda:**
So I am very glad to see you again. And especially to see Śrīman Rādhā-Mādhava, Gaura-Nitāi is being worshiped nicely. Thank you very much.

So my traveling was in India, Australia, New Zealand. I was to go to Africa also, but I could not go. Everywhere our International Society members are worshiping very nicely. In Australia---Sydney, Melbourne---Deity worship is going on very nicely. Similarly in New Zealand, Auckland. They have also purchased one house, and worship is going on nicely. New York, they are also doing very nicely, and you are also doing very nicely. [chuckles] Perhaps you are still going ahead. [laughs] Yes.

So I am very much thankful to you that Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, came to your country. He wanted to come here, and you have well received. And worship Him, serve Him; He will be happy. Introduce this movement all over your country. America is favored country. Little misguided about spiritual affairs, but if you introduce this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in right way, keeping yourself to the standard, then people will accept it gradually.

Of course, it is not so easy to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One must be very fortunate. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. //Bhāgyavān jīva// means fortunate. Unless one is very, very fortunate, one cannot take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetthi māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

"Out of many millions of men, one tries to make his life successful." "Make his life" means to distinguish oneself from the animal life. Animal life is meant for sense gratification.

So one who searches after real happiness---//ramante yogina anante//---unlimited happiness, he is intelligence. One who is satisfied with temporary happiness, he's not intelligent. //Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. Those who are satisfied with temporary happiness, they're not very intelligent. //Tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām. Alpa-medha// means those who have got little brain, they are satisfied with temporary happiness, and those who are advanced, //yogīs,// they are not satisfied with temporary happiness. They must be seeking for unlimited happiness. That can be achieved when you go back to home, back to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is eternal; His pastimes are eternal. Just join His pastimes: His //rasa// dance, His play with cowherds boy, His dealing with His father and mother in Vṛndāvana.

So our this movement is to join Kṛṣṇa's pastime. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma..., punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. Simply if you try to understand Kṛṣṇa... That is not very difficult. Everything is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// what is Kṛṣṇa, and further explained in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So if you simply read our books, follow the rules and regulation, chant sixteen rounds, it will be not very difficult. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [Brs. 1.2.234]. Things will reveal to you.

So if you, in this life, simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa, then your life is successful. What is that success? //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. After giving up this material body, no more acceptance of material body; we remain in our spiritual body. We have got our spiritual body. That is now covered by this material dress, subtle dress and gross dress. So if we give up the propensity of material sense gratification, that is //mukti.// So long we'll have a pinch, a drop of desire to enjoy material happiness, we'll have to accept a body, different types of body, out of the 8,400,000. But if we become satisfied with service of Kṛṣṇa, then we are no more interested with this material happiness. That is //mukti.// When we shall be detestful with this material happiness... //Āra nāre bapa//

Just like Jagāi-Mādhāi said, //āra nāre bapa.// No more [indistinct], ruination. That is //mukti.// Kṛṣṇa will give you all facility. He's giving facilities, whatever you want. //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy a...// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. Therefore we see varieties of life. It is arranged by Kṛṣṇa through the agency of material potency. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. It is going on. But if we say, "Kṛṣṇa...," to Kṛṣṇa, "Now, from this day, I surrender unto You. My Lord, I don't want anything material," then you are //mukta,// liberated. And if you keep the standard, //māyā// will not touch you. Then after giving up this body, you go back to home, back to Godhead. It is very easy.

So try to understand and be happy. Continue this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement in right earnest. Kṛṣṇa will help you. //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. Anyone who's engaged with heart and soul in the service of the Lord, Kṛṣṇa is within everyone, He'll give you intelligence: "Do like this. Do like this." //Yena mām upayānti.// He gives such intelligence by which you can go back to Him again.

Thank you very much. We shall talk again.
