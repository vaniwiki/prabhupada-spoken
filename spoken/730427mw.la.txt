====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
The cloud is..., a cloud is darker today.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dark cloud means there is water?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. The amount of water is more.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam// [//Bs. 5.30//]. //Ānande bolo hari bhaja vṛndāvana// [//Hari Haraye Namaḥ// 9].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's song, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Narottama dāsa song. Yes.

[pause]

**Lady Passerby:**
Good morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Good morning.

Have good morning to your dogs. [laughs]

**Man Passerby:**
Good morning!

**Prabhupāda:**
Good morning. Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Oh! Big.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Muscles.

**Prabhupāda:**
Another.

[pause]

[//japa//] The Japanese, they eat this seaweed.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is good for the fish-eaters, because it has got fishy taste, although it is vegetable. Those who are fish-eaters, even by smelling fish, fishy, they'll increase their appetite. Is it not?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Habit is like that.

[pause]

**Brahmānanda:**
You once said that the //urad ḍāl// is a good substitute for that fish taste.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Not taste.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Protein.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is containing protein. Taste is also...

[pause]

This seaweeds, all over the ocean. When passing ship, you can see. All over. Where is their root? Because the ocean is very deep. The root grows from the bottom?

**Karandhara:**
No, it doesn't have roots.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Karandhara:**
Doesn't have roots. Floats on top of the water.

**Prabhupāda:**
[//japa//] [pause]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Hari guru vaiṣṇava?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Hari guru vaiṣṇave.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Vaiṣṇave?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Majāiyā man// [//Hari Haraye Namaḥ// 9].

[pause]

[break] ...any sea-going ship?

**Karandhara:**
Well, they travel...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Karandhara:**
They... It's not really a well-traveled route. The ones that do travel are usually out farther in the channel. There's a big point. So they just go farther out so they don't have to curve around, all around the coast.

[break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...animal, goes like this?

**Karandhara & Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Crabs?

**Karandhara:**
Crabs and lobsters, yeah.

**Brahmānanda:**
Birds.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
They have got suitable beak, suitable beak to capture. Yes.

[pause]

What is this big bird?

**Brahmānanda:**
A seagull.

**Prabhupāda:**
They also eat fish?

**Brahmānanda:**
Fish, garbage---everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

[pause]

Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? If we add the conservation of energy from the Invocation of //Īśopaniṣad,// it will be a great challenge to science.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. That is conservation of energy. //Pūrṇam idam, pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśopaniṣad, Invocation]]].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The understanding in science is that if I burn a piece of wood, that wood contains originally cellulose. So it has certain amount carbons and a certain amount hydrogens. So if I burn it, that carbon will be converted to smaller molecules, like carbon dioxide and water. So if I balance it, starting from the original cellulose, so I'll get a certain number of carbon atoms and hydrogens. So the matter is conserved. In other words, it is not lost. That is the understanding of the science.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we also, we also say. The energy, we take the sum total, material energy, that is conserved. It is displayed again. When there is annihilation, the whole energy goes back to Kṛṣṇa. //Yānti māmikām, prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikām// [[books:bg:9:7|[Bg. 9.7]]].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But the original matter is changed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The original substance that I started has changed to some other form.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is just like you take cotton, you make thread---another form. Then from thread, you make cotton cloth.

**Brahmānanda:**
It's not lost.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not lost.

**Brahmānanda:**
It just changes its form.

**Prabhupāda:**
The original cotton is there. Simply form is changing. This is the process.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Is it the same from //pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya...// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everything is preserved. //Kārya kāraṇam,// cause and effect. In the effect, the cause is there. Therefore //Veda// says, //sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.1], "Everything is Brahman." Because the cosmic manifestation is the effect of the cause, energy of God, therefore in the effect there is God. //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. "In impersonal form, I am existing everywhere," God says, Kṛṣṇa says. //Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni:// "Everything is existing on Me." //Nāhaṁ teṣu ava...// "But I am not there." This is the personal and impersonal features of the Lord.

The whole cosmic manifestation is the impersonal---it is resting on the energy of God---but you cannot find God here. The example is just like a big businessman, he has got a big factory. The factory's depending on the energy of that man. But if you want to see that man in the factory, you cannot see. Is that example nice? You cannot say that the factory is existing without him. It is in his brain the whole factory's running on. But if you want to find out where is he, that will be difficult.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But he's there.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's there. He's there by his energy. He's there. Therefore in all government offices, the picture of the president is there. What is the idea? Here is also president present. But if you want to see him, then you have to go to his headquarter. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere, but if you want to talk with Kṛṣṇa, then you have to go Goloka Vṛndāvana. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

[pause] [break]

**Devotee:**
Sailboat?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yeah, sailboat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sailboat. [break] ...what is called?

**Brahmānanda:**
Seaweed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Seaweed. The Chinese, China, China grass? What is called? China grass? Some foodstuff is sold in the stores, China grass?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yeah, I think they dry it...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they go under some chemical process. That gentleman Mr. Patel in Ahmedabad, whose guest I was, he's doing this business.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh, this can be taken as food?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Under some chemical process. No, as it is can be taken. The Japanese take it.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is one of the targets of scientific research. They're going to find food from the ocean now.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is already food. What is this? You are... You have labor[?]. There is already food.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They're going to find more.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why more? Let them eat all the fishes first of all. Rascal, what more? They will take all the fishes and eat first, finish it. Then, then search for another. Simply rascaldom. Simply to take money from the government: "I'm making some research."

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. Cheating, simply. And the rascal government will supply money: "Yes." There is already food, sir. First of all you eat. Finish it. Then you make research for others. You cannot eat all the fishes even.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They're called "new food."

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
"New foods."

**Prabhupāda:**
New? Why don't you find out new death? Why it is old? Find out some new death.

**Brahmānanda:**
Some new sex.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Brahmānanda:**
New sex.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The same, old sex. Either in the naked club or at home, the thing is the same.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They call it "new" because they never tasted before.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not? Taste. Everyone is tasting sex.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is, the food.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think I..., Germany, in the war, they extracted fat from stool because stool is full of fat and hypophosphites. Stool. So there was scarcity of fat. So they were extracting fat from stool, by scientific method. There was no fat available in wartime. That my Godbrother, Sadānanda, when he came India, so I asked him that "You are German people. I've heard that German people are very stout and strong. Why you are lean and thin?"

So he replied that "During the war days, there was control. So I was getting fat, butter, simply because we were children." He showed his wristwatch, "To this, this much. Only for children, this much butter, weekly, once." That means under..., undernourished. So therefore they are finding out fat from stool. And the concentrated camp, Kīrtanānanda told me, actually they ate their own stool. And who was telling me...? Śrutakīrti, you were telling me that in the, what is called, capsule? They turn their stool into food.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Oh, that wasn't me. No.

**Devotee:**
In space?

**Karandhara:**
No, they turn the urine..., they turn the urine into water.

**Śrutakīrti:**
But someone was saying they also turn their stool into food.

**Karandhara:**
I don't know about that. I know they change the urine into water.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The urine, you just distill. Then, uh... No, urine, if it is, if one distills, turns to water. So the salt is deposited in the flask, and the water, pure water, will come out.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why don't you invent this "new food"? New aerated water, manufactured from urine. [laughter] Advertise. You'll get more customer. //Māyā// will give him intelligence to waste his time.

**Brahmānanda:**
Chewing the chewed.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. Instead of saving time for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //māyā// will give him intelligence how to waste time. This is //māyā.// Human life is so valuable that one second of this life should not be wasted. But these people are simply prescribing how to waste time. //Śrama eva hi kevalam// [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]].

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So this kind of thing is inquiring in the wrong direction?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In the wrong direction?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They're inquiring.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is right, but when we speak that the ultimate center is Kṛṣṇa, that they will deny. Therefore they're wrong. Just like you are coming this side. If I say, "Come to here," they'll say, "Why shall I go to there?" That is their fault.

We are requesting everyone that "Accept Kṛṣṇa in the center. All your research work will be successful." That they'll not.

[pause]

//Āsuri bhāvam āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. They'll not accept one thing---God. That is their business.

[pause]

[sings:] //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]].

[pause]

Jellyfish is also eaten by man?

**Karandhara:**
Jellyfish? No, I don't think so.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
They are meant for the birds?

**Karandhara:**
Fishes. Other fish eat them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, fish also.

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

[pause] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Water, they're also composition of atomic grains?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The hydrogen and oxygen, they're called compound. Compound of hydrogen and oxygen.

**Prabhupāda:**
So hydrogen and oxygens, they have got grains, molecular?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So it is called molecule, molecule of water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There are innumerable molecules in water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everywhere. In the sunshine also there is molecules, shining particles.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They're called photons. Photons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Protons?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Photons---p-h-o-t-o-n-s.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, photons. Similarly, we are also photons of Kṛṣṇa. That is our original.

**Brahmānanda:**
Like spot.

**Prabhupāda:**
Spot, yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Emanations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

[pause]

How the sand is made, according to scientists?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
By the combination of..., when one atom of silica, two atoms of oxygen. Called silicon dioxide, the chemical name, or silica. But this is existing as a silicate, as a salt of sodium, magnesium, silicate.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there is salt in the water. So from that salt it is produced?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. It reacts with the sodium, and the sodium in the water, in salt, that sodium reacts with silicic acid. So from sodium silicate, that becomes sand.

**Karandhara:**
It's not rocks pounded down?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No. Rocks? Oh... No, we can make silicate very easily by mixing the alkali, sodium and then acid. It is just the reaction between the acid in the base. So forming an acid...

**Prabhupāda:**
So far we know, there is this sand, combined with silicate of soda, makes glass.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, glass is nothing but silicate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Finer sort. Normally silicate is shining, but this is not shining because it contains various mixtures. Not only soda, but other magnesium, calcium silicates.

**Prabhupāda:**
Silicate of soda is mixed with soap also.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Adulteration. That's not first-class soap. Washing soap, they are mixed with silicate of soda. //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. 

[pause]

What is this cottage?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That small cottage?

**Brahmānanda:**
This one there?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, a lavatory.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
This one here.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, in the truck.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, in the... Moving cottage. Coming to primitive life.

**Karandhara:**
They all have the fashion. Everyone has a truck with a cottage on the back so they can move around.

**Brahmānanda:**
Like the tortoise.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Brahmānanda:**
Like the tortoise. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is new invention?

**Karandhara:**
Well, it's not new, but it's just got popular over the last few years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [//japa//]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, [indistinct---Bengali?]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Bengali] //Phala. Phala.// What type of fruit is the best?

**Prabhupāda:**
Fruit?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mango is the best.

**Brahmānanda:**
And that dried mango.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, any mango.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, mango is the king of fruits.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I bought some mangoes, but the inside was so bad. Come from...

**Prabhupāda:**
Well...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Not very fresh here.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[indistinct] They don't taste like mangoes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can, you can try to get mango dried, //amsattva.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Amsattva.//

**Prabhupāda:**
You know that //amsattva?//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Dried mango juice.

**Brahmānanda:**
In a slab.

**Prabhupāda:**
In slab they're available.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can try in that Indian's... They call //amaut. Amaut// or //amsattva.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
[Bengali] From Ceylon they get some mangoes, but they come in..., in cans, with some juice. That's not very good. From Ceylon.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Mango is tropical fruit?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Huh, tropical fruit. That's why it's very good in Hawaii and in India and all tropical countries. Because nature makes the sugar inside. Forms sugar, carbohydrate, in the reaction of carbon dioxide and the water.

**Prabhupāda:**
But we take it without analysis. [laughter]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are studying how the banana is making sugar inside by nature.

[pause] [end]
