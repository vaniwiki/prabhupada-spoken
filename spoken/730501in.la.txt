Hare Kṛṣṇa. Come on. [//japa//] What are the rules?

Asura-kula-nāśana.

Oh, //karmīs.// [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not only //karmīs;// others also. So-called scientist.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya! Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. Anyone who is posing himself as very much advanced in education but has no knowledge in Kṛṣṇa, he is also a demon.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
...he's a demon.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Demon means he is not a devotee. That is demon. There are two kinds of persons: one demon, and one demigod. Those who are devotees, they are demigods, and those who are not devotees, they are demons.

> dvau bhūta-sargau loke
> asura..., daiva āsura eva ca
> viṣṇu-bhakti-bhaved daiva
> āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ
> [[books:bg:16:6|[Bg. 16.6]]]

//Asura. Asura// means just the opposite number of devotees. That’s all. This is the general definition of demons: opposite number. So anyone who is against Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is a demon. That’s all. This is general. Come on. What are the rules and regulation?

**Prabhupāda:**
