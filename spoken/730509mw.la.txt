====== Morning Walk ======

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
Testing, one, two three.Śrīla Prabhupāda's morning walk, May 9th, 1973, at Venice beach, in Los Angeles. [break]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was going to ask is there any difference between //acintya-śakti// and mystic //yoga// power?

**Prabhupāda:**
They call it mystic.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The same?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Mystic yogic power means the same //acintya-śakti,// dormant potency, which is within everyone. That can be awakened. The same example, as I have given, that everyone has got the potency to swim, but it has to be practiced. I cannot swim. For me, if one is swimming, it is inconceivable power. But I have got also that power. By practice, it has to be awakened.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is a yogic process.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is yogic process. Real yogic process is to find out Paramātmā, but side by side, many other dormant powers become awakened. Another example: that tree is producing chemicals. So every living entity has got dormant potencies, more or less. So God, Kṛṣṇa, is the supreme living entity; therefore He has the full potency. God means full, complete. //Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. The best living entity, that is God.

[pause]

Is there any difficulty to understand the best living entity?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The best living entity?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So that best living entity is God. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. That means the best controller, the supreme controller. Just like this man is controlling his dog, and that man is controlled by somebody else. In his office or where he works, he is controlled by his boss. And the dog is controlling the cat, the cat is controlling rat. In this way, one after another, there are controllers. I control you, he controls me, another controls him. In this way, you go on searching.

When you find out somebody who controls but is not controlled by anyone, He is God. Where is the difficulty to understand? Everyone here we see that although a person is controller, at the same time he is controlled. Therefore the ideal living entity is, he controls but he is not controlled by others. That is supreme.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So the supreme living entity...

**Prabhupāda:**
He is God. He is living entity, //nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. That is the Vedic version.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So he doesn't have to practice yogic power.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because He is most perfect, He hasn't got to practice. Just like the fish hasn't got to practice how to live within the water, natural. //Svābhāvikī.// It is called //svābhāvikī. Svābhāvikī// means by nature. If I want to fly in the sky, I will have to find out... Just like these boys are struggling with the waves with precaution, with so much practice, but a small fish, he doesn't care for big, big waves; it will go against. So that small fish is more powerful than you in that respect.

You are struggling against the waves, but the small fish goes against the waves without any difficulty. A small, teeny... So many things. There are many superiors than you. The most superior is God. That's all. That is the definition of God. You won't find anybody superior than Him. //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. There is no more any superior. That is God.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
When the living entity comes to the human platform, though he is conditioned, but still, by practice of //yoga// he can develop...

**Prabhupāda:**
Some of the powers.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
...which cannot be developed by other living entities, like, for example, fish.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. That distinction is there between one living entity and another. You have got some power; others have got another power. That's //tara-tama,// means comparative and superlative... That is called //tara-tama.//

[pause]

There are varieties of potencies. All these potencies are visible---some in you, some in me, some in others---but all the varieties in full potency is in God. That is God. Not like this rascal incarnation of God. What is that, they came? Balajī?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Guru Maharaja?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Not that. [laughs] That Kṛṣṇa was requested by His teacher that when He was offering that "Now I am going home. What shall I present to you, //guru-dakṣiṇā,// giving to the //guru?//" So he requested, "Kṛṣṇa, I have heard that You are so powerful. I lost my two sons. If you bring them..." So Kṛṣṇa immediately went and brought them from within the ocean. This is God.

Similarly, Devakī also requested Kṛṣṇa that "Kṛṣṇa, before Your birth I lost seven children. Your maternal uncle killed them. So I want... I have heard that You have returned back the sons of Your teacher. Why not my sons?" So He brought them. That is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa went to Kāraṇārṇavaśāyī Viṣṇu, penetrating the covering of this universe. Arjuna also went with Him. You know that?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No. Kṛṣṇa...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa went outside this universe, penetrating the sky. And Arjuna also accompanied Him. So it is Kṛṣṇa's power, He took His friend also. For ordinary human being it is not possible. But because Kṛṣṇa said that "All right, I'll take you," so He took him. This covering, universal covering, there are seven layers: earth, water, fire, air... Each layer is ten times bigger than the one layer. Then you go to the spiritual world.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Ten times bigger than each layer, it increases?

**Prabhupāda:**
That one layer, the other layer is ten times bigger than the first layer, and the third are ten times bigger than that, ten times. In this way the whole universe is covered. What your scientists know? [laughs]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Scientists say that there are different layers in the atmosphere. There is ionosphere and all those spheres.

**Prabhupāda:**
So anyway, some ideas are there. But in //Bhāgavata// it is all written.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But they do not say that ten times.

**Prabhupāda:**
What do they know? They do not know anything. Know something.

[pause]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So when we establish the theory of //acintya-śakti...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Not only //acintya-śakti.// First of all you have to establish that life is not from matter; matter is from life. Then they will be under your control. First of all you have to establish. Because their whole scientific advancement is going on on this basis, that life is from matter. But that is not the fact. Matter is from life, just the opposite. First of all you have to establish this. Why don't you write a theory and get Nobel Prize? This is a fact. Now you have to prove only, by their scientific words. That's all. Fact is this is. Are you convinced about this fact, that matter comes from life, not life comes from matter? Are you convinced or not? Otherwise how you can write?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, I am convinced.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why don't you write in scientific language? All these material elements have come from life, not that from material elements life has come. No. That is not the fact. Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:// "Everything from Me." But Kṛṣṇa is life. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]], //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]].

So... And //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. So many informations are there, "Me," "Mine," "I am," like that. So He is life. Our God is not dead. Our God is life, living, just like us, one of us. But He is more powerful. That's it. Our God eats, sleeps, like us, just like we eat, sleep. The difference is that He eats, but He keeps the thing as it is.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
//Oṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idam// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśopaniṣad, Invocation]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And we eat, we finish. And we cannot again produce. God's power is like that, that He eats, at the same, keeps everything intact for your eating. And I, if you give me a plate, I eat and there is nothing for you. That is difference. He also eats. Otherwise we are making all these bogus things, preparing so many nice things, offering to God? Is that false?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. He is so complete that one minus one equal to one. That is Absolute. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is expanding Himself by so many energies, but Kṛṣṇa is the same. There is no loss in His energy. Even in a human being or animal, he produces so many children. Just like hog---he produces at least one dozen children every year, but the hog is the same. If a hog can have so much power...

And formerly, one man used to produce hundreds of children. Wherefrom the potency comes? If a man is giving birth to hundreds of children, but still he is the same man, wherefrom the potency comes? Why man? Even the fish, thousands of eggs they produce, and thousands of fishes are again produced. Wherefrom the potency comes?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
From the supreme controller.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not supreme... He has got. From the supreme control..., yes, but directly we see that he has got so much potency. Everything is coming from Supreme; that's a fact. But you can see hundreds and thousands of children produced by one single living entity. The snakes, they produce hundreds and thousands of children at a time. Fortunately, they eat their own children. Otherwise, the whole world would have been full of snakes only.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They eat?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. All animals, they eat their children.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I have seen the eggs of snakes. They are small, this big, the eggs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
As the Kali-yuga advances, the human beings will eat their children too, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. Just like in the last war, they ate stool, their own stool, out of hunger. So when there will be no foodstuff, they will kill their own children. Already they are killing, abortion. Not only abortion; children grows... By surgical instrument, they kill and they take out the child... They are already killing.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
When they take the pill, the birth control pill, are they killing their children too?

**Prabhupāda:**
Killing means killing. What is that? What he is asking? I do not...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
He is asking that they take the pill, birth control pill.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
They have abortion, but they also take birth control pills.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that is one kind of killing. But directly killing. They, through some instrument, through the vagina, they kill, cut into pieces and get out. Living children. He is a scientist. That surgeon, he is a scientist, and doing this business.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, medical scientist.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. He is paid for that killing.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They lost the mercifulness, the quality...

**Prabhupāda:**
What merciful? Animal has mercifulness. They are animals only. This modern civilization is producing animals. That's it. Who was speaking that slaughterhouse they are giving some injection that the animal may not feel pain? Rascal, he is killing him, and he is humanitarian work, he may not feel killed. If I say, "I shall kill you, but you will not feel any pain. Come on..." This is their philosophy. They are killing, and they are saying, "Oh, may not be feeling any pain." Such rascaldom is going on. I therefore do not talk with any rascal except my disciples. I know they are all rascals. Waste of time. All this rascaldom is coming out of that wrong notion that life is from matter, that wrong notion.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is why they say, "So long as I am alive, enjoy as much as you can."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is their philosophy. Hedonism.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
If they know that there is life after death or life started from life, then they would not be doing like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
So many things you will change.

[pause] [watching surfers]

And that is mystic power for me.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
Surfing?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, because I do not know how to do it. Therefore it is mystic power. But the boy is going like this.

[pause]

Just like one of the //yogīs,// she [he] walked over the river, crossed. So another old man said, "Oh, this is only two-//paisa// worth." Why? "I will pay two //paisa// to this boatman. He will cross me there." But to attain that power, he had to spend so many years for practicing. This is waste of time. If you can do it by paying two //paisa// or one //anna// to a boatman to cross the river, why should you for ten years or fifteen years practice this //yoga,// just to show a magic?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Prabhupāda, I remember an incident in Bombay. That was when I was in Calcutta about..., a few years ago. There was a //yogī.// There was advertisement that he was going to walk on water.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is possible.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So I think it was about five hundred rupees per ticket.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, just see. His real aim was to get some money.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Radhakrishnan was there, the president. But ultimately, he could not walk. He fell down in the water.

**Prabhupāda:**
And what about the money?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I don't know. He was beaten or something. They said he missed something.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's like you, chemist, they say, missing something: "In future we shall do it." It is the same thing. And these fools, Dr. Radhakrishnan and company, they are so fools that so many animals, they are walking on the sea. "I am going to see another man." Just see, how they are fools. What is their credit? The sea lark. They call sea lark? They go very nicely. Why do they not see that? He is animal, he is, another is an animal.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
Birds can float on the sea and they can fly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So Dr. Radhakrishnan was a big rascal.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But I could not believe by that time. I said, "It cannot be possible."

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is possible. It is possible. If one has practiced //yoga// system, he can become light. To walk over the water means to become very light, like cotton swab. Then he can walk. He can fly also. In Siddhalokas, the inhabitants there, they fly in the sky. From one planet to another planet they go by flying. There is Siddhaloka planet. Therefore they are called, Siddhaloka, means they have all perfection of this yogic mystic power.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
Are Siddhalokas like angels, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Angels, you can call they are angels. But there are human beings who fly. In your side, Kāmākhyā, there are some ladies they can fly in the sky on a tree. You have not heard?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I very vaguely have heard.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There are. They can fly in the sky on a tree.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
When I was a child, our grandfathers used to tell those things. So I would...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is a fact. That is mentioned in //Bhāgavata// also, that... Whose daughter? She dreamed of a nice husband. So her friend...

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
Uṣā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, Uṣā, Uṣā, yes. So Aniruddha. That friend brought Aniruddha, Kṛṣṇa's son. She dreamt Aniruddha. So she promised, "I am bringing you just picture. Which picture you would like?"

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
Citralekhā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Citralekhā. Yes, he remembers.

[pause]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There is an experiment that was done by Pasteur, a French scientist, a long time ago. In that experiment he boiled some..., I think it was water. Because normally the water, without boiling there are so many microorganisms, small, small living entities, that can be detected under microscope. He wanted to know whether life started from some ingredients inside or just life started from life. So he boiled this solution, and he kept for some time under very careful covering so that there is no contamination from outside. And then there was no life. He couldn't find any organisms. So they said, "Life starts from matter." That is one of the experiments.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that experiment?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Boil water first of all. Without boiling water, they can detect so many organisms, small, small bacteria, and these small, small living entities under microscope. But when they would boil it and it kept for some time, and then they tested, there was no organisms.

**Prabhupāda:**
But that microscope is imperfect. That is our contention. Because the living entities, the dimension of the living entity is one ten-thousandth part of the top of your hair. So what you can see?

**Karandhara:**
Also, they make the condition unsuitable for the spirit soul to occupy. Just like if we take and kill all these bodies and put them somewhere, and come back in a week, it's not that life will come back to the bodies. They make the circumstances unsuitable for the spirit soul.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is another explanation. It takes time. Besides that, according to //Bhagavad-gītā,// life is not killed by fire. //Aśoṣyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam// [[books:bg:2:24|[Bg. 2.24]]]. You have not read it? //Adāhyaḥ:// "It cannot be burnt into fire." So how life can be killed by boiling water? That is their nonsense.

**Karandhara:**
As soon the bodies become unsuitable, so the spirit soul leaves.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Aśoṣyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam. Adāhyaḥ.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But by putting proper chemicals, then they can see again. The ingredients necessary for the survival of the living entities, the necessary amounts, like source of protein, source of carbon, then the life is again started.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Wherefrom the life came?

**Karandhara:**
It's not started. It becomes suitable again for the spirit soul. So they come.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
They're just changing the living conditions.

**Karandhara:**
Like if you put honey, ants will come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is good example. That does not mean the honey is producing ants. If life is coming from matter, then why you are putting chemicals? That is also matter. Life will come.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They say without the chemicals, they cannot see life.

**Prabhupāda:**
The chemical is also matter. Just like with one matter you make... Just like we mix so many matters. Turmeric, salt, spices, they are all matter. But mixing together, the condition is that it becomes a sweet vegetable. Similarly, the chemical is also matter, and water is also matter. So if life comes from matter, then it will come from the water. Why...?

There is no use of mixing another chemicals. And it will actually be. Then let the water remain for some time. When it will decompose, the life will come. The is stagnant water, life will come. Just like in the ocean, there are so many lives are coming out. Who is going to put the chemical? Nonsense. Where you have got so much chemical? And you can find out tons and tons, millions of tons of fish, but nobody went to give there the chemicals.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They will say nature supplies the chemicals.

**Prabhupāda:**
So therefore that nature's potency is //acintya.// That is beyond your calculation. That is our point. How nature is supplying, that you do not know. How, there is very common thing. Just like from my body there are so many worms and germs will come out in the stool. There are so many worms. I am also producing life. I am not going to add some chemical. But the chemical is being supplied by me, by my potency. Otherwise, why so many worms are there in the stool---hookworm and this worm and that worm? Sometimes from wood, what is called, termite? They come. And who is going to supply that chemical? And not from all wood. At a certain stage it will come, without your adding chemicals.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The chemicals are already there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Already there. Everywhere chemicals are there. When the suitable circumstance is complete, then there is life. //Sveda-ja.// They are called //sveda-ja.// By fermentation, by perspiration, life will come. //Aṇḍa-ja. Aṇḍa-ja// means coming from the egg [indistinct]. [end]
