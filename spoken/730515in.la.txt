**Prabhupāda:**
So your name is Jagariṇī. Jagariṇī---who is always awake; never sleeps. [laughter] Just see. This life is for //jagaraṇa. Uttiṣṭhata jāgrata.// Everyone is sleeping, dull, like animal. The animals are sleeping. Although they are running very fast, but according to //śāstra,// they are sleeping because they do not know what is life. So anyone who does not know what is the value of life, he is sleeping.

And one who knows what is the value of life, he is //jāgrata.// The Vedic injunction is this, //uttiṣṭhata jāgrata prāpya varān nibodhata// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 1.3.14]: "Now, this time, in human form of life, you become awakened, and the benediction which you have got, utilize it."
