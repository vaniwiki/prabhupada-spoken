====== Morning Walk At Cheviot Hills Golf Course ======

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
[introducing recording] [Prabhup] ...āda's morning walk, recorded May 17th, 1973, at Cheviot Hills Park, in Los Angeles.

[break] [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Have you translated or not?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Inconceivable?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Inconceivable or mystic.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Mystic power.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I am just collecting what Śrīla Prabhupāda explained, the different //acintya-śaktis// that we observe.

**Prabhupāda:**
Here the //acintya-śakti// is working, this mist, fog. You have no power to drive it away. Beyond your power. You can explain with some juggling of words...

**Passerby:**
Good morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Good morning.

...that "Such chemicals, such molecules, such this, that," there are so many things. But [laughing] you have no power to drive it away.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yeah. They have an explanation how the mist is formed. They call...

**Prabhupāda:**
That you can do. That is..., I can do also. It is not very great credit. But if you know how it is formed, then counteract it.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We know how it is formed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So you know, then you discover counteracting. Just like formerly, in the warfare, the atomic //brahmāstra// was thrown. On the other side... //Brahmāstra// means excessive heat. So they caused something, they transformed into water. Because after heat, there must be water. So where is that science?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It is just like milk. Milk looks white, but it is just water. They call it, it's a colloidal suspension of proteins, these caseins, in water. So similarly, this fog is just a colloidal suspension of water in the air.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So you create some fire, it will be immediately driven away. Water can be driven away by fire. So you create. That you cannot. You just shot one bomb. There will be some heat, and all the mist will go away. Do it.

**Karandhara:**
That would blow up the planet. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Hare Kṛṣṇa. Water can be counteracted by fire or air. Everyone knows it. So you do it, suspension. So this is for you mystic power. You can talk all nonsense, but you cannot act against it. Therefore it is mystic power. So similarly, there are so many things. That is //acintya-śakti.// You cannot think of even. By nature's way, immediately the sun rises---no more mist. All finished. A little temperature increase of the sun, all finished. //Nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]].

This example is given in the //Bhāgavata. Nīhāra.// This is called //nīhāra.// Just like //nīhāra// is immediately dissipated by //bhāskara,// by the sun, similarly, if one can awaken his dormant devotion, then all finished, all his reaction of sinful activities, finished. //Nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.// You just create... You calculate sun is composition of this chemical, that chemical. Just create one sun and throw it. Simply theoretical future, bluff and juggling of words, that's not good.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is what the research means. Research means to understand what was not known before.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Research means you admit that you are all fools and rascals. Research meant for whom? Who does not know. Otherwise, where is the question of research? You do not know. You admit that. So, so many mystic powers are there. You do not know how it is being done. Therefore you have to accept inconceivable power. And without accepting this principle of inconceivable power, there is no meaning of God. Not like that Bala Yogi became a God.

So these are for the rascals, fools. But those who are intelligent, they will test the inconceivable power. Just like we accept Kṛṣṇa as God---inconceivable power. We accept Rāma---inconceivable power. Not so cheaply. One rascal comes and says, "I am incarnation of God"; another rascal accepts. It is not like that: "Ramakrishna is God." We do not accept. We must see the inconceivable mystic power. Just like Kṛṣṇa, as a child, lifted a hill. This is inconceivable mystic power. Rāmacandra, He constructed a bridge of stone without pillar. The stone began to float: "Come on."

So that is inconceivable power. And because you cannot adjust this inconceivable power, when they are described, you say, "Oh, these are all stories." What is called? "Mythology." But these great, great sages, Vālmīki and Vyāsadeva and other //ācāryas,// they simply wasted their time in writing mythology? Such a learned scholars? And they have not interpreted that it is mythology. They have accepted it as actual fact. There was forest fire. All the friends of cowherd boys, they became disturbed. They began to see towards Kṛṣṇa: "Kṛṣṇa, what to do?" "All right." He simply swallowed up the whole fire. This is inconceivable mystic power. That is God.

//Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. The six opulences in full---that is God. [//japa//] That inconceivable power, inconceivable energy or mystic power, we have got also, very minute quantity. So many things are going on within our body, we cannot explain. The same example: my nails are coming exactly in the form. Although it is spoiled by disease, again it is coming. I do not know what machinery is going on, and the nail is coming, exactly fitting the position and everything. That is coming from my body. So that is mystic power. Even it is mystic power for me and to the doctors, everyone... They cannot explain.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
The doctors are marveling... The doctors are marveled at the complex nature of the human brain. They are amazed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. But they are rascal. It is not the brain that is working; it is the spirit soul that is working. The same thing: the computer machine. The rascal will think that a computer machine is working. No. The man is working. He pushes the button, then it works. Otherwise, what is the value of this machine? You keep the machine for thousands of years, it will not work. When another man will come, put the button, then it will work. So who is working? The machine is working or the man is working? And the man is also another machine. And it is working due to the presence of Paramātmā, God. Therefore, ultimately, God is working. A dead man cannot work.

So how long a man remains living? So long the Paramātmā is there, //ātmā// is there. Even the //ātmā// is there, if Paramātmā does not give him intelligence, he cannot work. //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. God is giving me intelligence, "You put this button," then I put this button. So ultimately Kṛṣṇa is working. Another, untrained man cannot come and work on it because there is no intelligence. And a particular man who is trained up, he can work. So these things are going on. Ultimately comes to Kṛṣṇa. What you are researching, what you are talking, that is also Kṛṣṇa is doing. Kṛṣṇa is giving you int... You, you prayed for this facility to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is giving you. Sometimes you find accidentally the experiment is successful. So when Kṛṣṇa sees that you are so much harassed in experimental, "All right do it."

Just like Yaśodā-mā was trying to tie Kṛṣṇa, but she could not do. But when Kṛṣṇa agreed, it was possible. Similarly, this accident means Kṛṣṇa helps you: "All right, you have worked so hard, take this result." Everything is Kṛṣṇa. //Mattaḥ sarvam pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. This is explained. //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. Everything is sprang from Kṛṣṇa.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They say, "Kṛṣṇa didn't give me the proper steps how to do the experiments."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, He gives you. Otherwise how you are doing it? Whatever you are doing, that is by Kṛṣṇa's grace. And when you are still favorable, then Kṛṣṇa will give you more facilities. Kṛṣṇa will give you facility, will favor you, as much as you desire, not more than that. //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva...// As much proportionately you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, the intelligence will come. If you fully surrender, then full intelligence will come. It is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. [asking about the ground] Wet?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No. Little wet, but not much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa says, "You fully surrender. I give you full protection." //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He will give you full intelligence.

[break] ...these facts in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That will be our great success, when the scientific world will admit. Let them admit simply. Then our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will be great success. You simply admit, "Yes, there is God and mystic power." Then our movement is very successful.

And that's a fact. Simply talking like a nonsense amongst the nonsense, that is not a very great credit. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. One blind man is leading other blind man. What is the value of such? They are all blind. And so long one remains blind and rascal, he does not accept God. This is the test. As soon as we see that he does not accept God, he is blind, rascal, fool, whatever you can call. Take it for granted, however, whatever he may be, he's a rascal. On this principle we can challenge so many big, big chemist, philosopher, whoever comes to us. We say, "You are demon." The other chemist came, you brought him, that Indian?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Hmm. Tiwari. Tiwari.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tiwari. [laughing] So I told him that "You are a demon." But he was not angry. He admitted. And all his argument was refuted. Perhaps you remember.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. In fact, he was telling that "Kṛṣṇa didn't give me all the procedures, steps, how to do the experiment." That was... He was saying like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "Why shall I give you?" You are a rascal, you are against Kṛṣṇa, why Kṛṣṇa will give you facility? If you are against Kṛṣṇa and you want the credit without Kṛṣṇa, that's not possible. You must be submissive first of all. Then Kṛṣṇa will give you all facilities. Just like we dare to face any chemist, any scientist, any philosopher. Why?

On the strength of Kṛṣṇa, we believe that "There is Kṛṣṇa. When I shall talk with him, Kṛṣṇa will give give me intelligence." This is the basics. Otherwise, from qualification, standard, they are very much qualified. We are common laymen before them. But how do we challenge them? Because we know. Just like a small child, he can challenge a very big man because he knows, "My father is there." He is catching the hand of the father, and he's sure that "Nobody can do anything to me."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, I want to make sure the meaning of //tad apy aphalatāṁ jātaṁ...// [//Brahma-Vaivarta Purana//].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tad apy aphalatāṁ jātaṁ.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Teṣām ātmābhimāninām, bālakānām anāśritya...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Teṣām ātmābhimān..., bālakānām anāśritya govinda-caraṇa-dvayam.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. That "Human form of life becomes spoiled for those..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "Who do not try to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Simply he dies like animal." That's all. Just like the cats and dogs, they also take birth. They eat, sleep and beget children and die. The human life is like that.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Jāta// means the species? //Jāta?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jāta. Jāta// means born. //Aphalatāṁ jātam. Jāta// means it becomes futile. Futile. The human form of life becomes futile if he does not accept //govinda-caraṇa. Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// If he's not convinced that "I worship the original Personality of Godhead, Govinda," then he's spoiled. That's all. His life is spoiled.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Ātmābhimāninām// means the...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ātmā, dehātmā-māninām.// "I am this body."

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So those self-centered...

**Prabhupāda:**
Self? They have no information of the self. These rascals, they think, "I am this body." //Ātmā// means body, //ātmā// means self, //ātmā// means mind. So this //ātmābhimānī// means bodily concept of life. //Bālaka. Bālaka// means a fool, child, //bālaka. Ātmābhimānināṁ bālakānām.// Those who are under the bodily concept of life, they are like children, fools, or animals.

[pause]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So I plan to expound the principle of transmigration through this verse.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Transmigration. //Bhramadbhiḥ. Bhramadbhiḥ// means transmigration, wandering from one body to another. Just like I am here, I have got my this body..., a dress, covering. And when I go India, this is not required. So they are taking that the body has evolved like that. But no. Here, under certain condition, I accept this dress. In another place, under certain condition, I accept another dress. So I am the important, not this dress. But these rascals are studying the dress only. That is called //ātmābhimānām:// considering of the dress, body. //Bālakānām.// Just see.

They bring here dogs for passing stool. Dog stool is so very much infectious. The diphtheria and other germs, they are grown. But these rascals, they do not know. They distribute dog stool everywhere. But cow dung, there is no cow dung. //Vedas// says cow dung is pure. That is neglected. Dog stool is pure. This is their intelligence. They give signboard: "Littering illegal"?

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
But dog stool is not illegal. Just see how foolish they are. If you drop a paper on this grass, that is illegal. But you can get your dogs pass stool, it doesn't matter. This is their intelligence. They will not allow if you are bringing one mango from other part of the country, but they will allow dog also bringing so many germs. They do not know. Dog also brings so many germs, infectious germs.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That is why they were very careful. When the astronauts from the moon, when they come back on the surface of the planet, they thought there might be some germs which they do not know yet. So they put it in quarantine for several days, to make sure that they are...

**Prabhupāda:**
First of all make sure whether he had gone there, and then talk of all these things. [laughing] I am not sure they are going there.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
You know they made another blunder.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. What is that?

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
They made a spaceship that they wanted to orbit around the earth so that they could send men and ship an outpost.

**Karandhara:**
A house, station.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
So they sent it up and it failed. It cost two billion dollars or something, squandered.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. Why they are wasting time in that, money?

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
They were criticized in the paper.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fool. Simply childish. //Bālaka.// What are they gaining? For the last... How many years they are trying for going to the moon planet?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Oh, more than ten years. Started... Russia started in 1957. First sputnik where Gagarin was there...

**Prabhupāda:**
Over twenty-five years. So they could not get anything, not a single farthing even. Still they are doing. Just see, obstinacy. //Punaḥ punaś carvita.// This is called chewing the chewed. //Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]. They will never be successful. So I am a layman. When I wrote that //Easy Journey?// In 1950..., '67. How many years?

**Devotee:**
Ten.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, [indistinct] ten.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Sixty-seven

**Karandhara:**
Six years.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Not '67, '57. Yes.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
Sixteen years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sixteen years before. They are all childish. I am a layman. It will never be successful. It is already written there in my //Easy Journey to Other Planet.// Here also, that, some press reporter asked me in San Francisco when I landed, "What is your opinion about this moon planet?" "It is simply a waste of time and energy. That's all." You cannot go there.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They have very big plan in the future, going to the surface of the Mars planet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is future. That is all your statement, "future." With future hope you become a big man. That is their foolishness.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Future, about ten years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever... It may be one year, but we do not accept such proposition. We want to see what you have done now.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
First of all they have to develop the methods how to do it by a small scale...

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] In my childhood I was thinking... The tramcar is going on trolley. So I was thinking, "I shall stand on the tram line and just take a stick and touch the wire and I will go." I was planning like that. [laughter] [break]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
...without knowing Kṛṣṇa, is this a struggle for existence, any activity?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Activity without knowing the purpose of it, that is struggle for existence. You must know why you are working so hard. What for I shall work? The aim of life is missing. //Na te viduḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. They do not know it. Therefore failure, confusion, hopelessness. All the results of this world, hopelessness. Is it not?

What is one... Show one result, that it is very successful, hopeful. Just like, say, moon planet. Hopelessness. What is there? They spend so much time and money, but what is this? Hopelessness. They do not know. All scientists are working, all politicians are financing, but result is hopelessness. Is it not? Similarly, everything they are doing, but they are so rascal, they will never admit that "We are failure." Still they will stick, "Yes, we are success. Future, in ten years, we shall do it. Never mind."

I have seen, one man was condemned to death in Allahabad high court. So the lawyer was assuring, "Don't be disappointed. I shall get you out by appeal. Don't be disappointed." I have seen it. That lawyer was very big lawyer, an Englishman, Mr. Allston. And one man was condemned to death. He killed his servant very mercilessly. And the case was... He was a doctor, medical practitioner. So he was condemned to death. So after the condemnation, when he was coming out of the courtroom, I saw that he was flattering, "Don't be disappointed. I shall get you out by appeal." This is going on.

He wants to bluff him, but this is the high-court judgment. How there can be appeal? There may be appeal in the Supreme Court, but he is simply bluffing. Just like medical men: they'll repeatedly give you medicine, "All right, let me try this. This pill you try. This pill you try." They will never admit, "This is hopeless." This is going on. Bluffing, simply bluffing. Cheating, that's all.

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
If they admit they are failures, they'll never get any more grants.

**Prabhupāda:**
You see? All utopian. One platform... It is called //ākāśa-puṣpa, ākāśa-puṣpa,// to get flower from the sky. It is called //ākāśa-puṣpa.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Flower from the sky?

**Prabhupāda:**
Sky. This kind of plan is called //ākāśa-puṣpa.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Ākāśa-puṣpa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ākāśa-puṣpa.// Or the //bakāṇḍa-nyāya. Bakāṇḍa. Bakāṇḍa,// the testicle of the bull, and the duck, he is expecting, "Here is a fish. It will drop, and I will take it." He is following. Have you seen? In India we have seen many. The bull is going on, on the..., and the //baka// is going on. And whole day and night, he is after that: "It is a fish, big fish. It will drop and I shall take." //Bakāṇḍa-nyāya.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There is also a bird, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it is called heron, h-e-r-o-n

**Prabhupāda:**
Heron? I do not know.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yeah. They have long beaks. They also, they are always with the cows.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is //baka.// We call //baka.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They are all the time... They stay mostly in wetlands.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, //bakāṇḍa-nyāya.//

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The scientists, when we say that "The attempts that you are doing are no good," then they want to make sure that what I am saying is right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, because I see that you are rascal, therefore I am right. You are rascal. You don't admit, but I see that you are a rascal. You don't admit, but I see that you are a rascal. Therefore I am right. This is the argument. You are so rascal that you cannot admit your rascaldom. Just like this moon planet expedition. But I, sixteen years before, I told that these are rascals. Therefore I am right.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
They claim that "We have done so much."

**Prabhupāda:**
What have you done? You have simply spoiled money. That's all. In that sense I have done so much. Simply by teaching people, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," they are coming to such light. What do you think? Huh? I have done most wonderful things than them. [//japa//]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
But even if they do not know during their lifetime, at least, towards the end of their life, at the time of death, then they'll remember that "I have wasted my life."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is warned by Śaṅkarācārya. Vivekananda lamented at the end of his life that "I have simply wasted my life." He admitted, "I have not given anything." //Bālakānām.// He was after this body, and he was recorded, government record, as political //sannyāsī.//

**Kṛṣṇa-kāntī:**
Political //sannyāsa?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He had political purpose, but was acting as a //sannyāsī.// Just like Gandhi, "saintly statesman." He is recorded "saintly statesman." He's a statesman, politician, but he was introducing some morality, nonviolence, like that. Actually, his philosophy failed. He wanted Hindu-Muslim unity, but it was divided. The Muslim and Hindu divided.

He wanted nonviolence. He died out of violence. Therefore all his philosophy failed. And Indian independence was achieved not by Gandhi's nonviolence method but Subhas Bose's violence method. And he wanted to explain nonviolence from //Bhagavad-gītā.// Just see, another foolishness. //Bhagavad-gītā// is spoken in the battlefield, and he was screwing some meaning to prove his nonviolence.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In one of the articles by Bharatiya... There's a man called Bharatiya, in...

[aside:] What is the university?

He was saying that Nirana[?] Subhas Bose, he wanted to join Ramakrishna Mission. Is this true, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
For future. No. Might be. He wanted to join? Why he should join? Why he did not join?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It was explained that he had a better..., great mission, so he should not join, "You should do your..." By that time he was started fighting for freedom. So he was not allowed.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what was that greater mission?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
For independence, fighting.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Why he wanted to join Ramakrishna Mission? What is the attraction of Ramakrishna Mission? What they have done? Ramakrishna Mission, what they have done? The Ramakrishna Mission is working here in your country... [end]
