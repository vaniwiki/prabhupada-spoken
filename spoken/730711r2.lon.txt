====== Room Conversation with Indian Guest ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...accepted in that group.

**Indian man (1):**
Suppose if somebody is absolutely ignorant about...

**Prabhupāda:**
So therefore there should be education. Why the //śāstras// are there? Why //guru// is there? //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. You must accept //guru// and learn. Why should you remain ignorant?

**Indian man (1):**
How one should start when he's completely ignorant of all these things?

**Prabhupāda:**
He should go... //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet.//

**Indian man (1):**
//Tad viddhi praṇipātena...// [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Paripraśnena sevayā.// He should become a disciple of a bona fide //guru.// Otherwise, how he can learn? If you are uneducated, you should go to school.

**Indian man (1):**
[aside:] You want to ask anything?

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [laughter] It is very difficult to, to //guru,// but when //guru// comes, they also do not accept him. What can be done? They are so fallen. Only fortunate. //Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]].

So to go to //guru,// to Kṛṣṇa, that requires fortune. //Kona bhāgyavān jīva.// Some fortunate person. //Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. By the mercy of //guru// and Kṛṣṇa, he gets the seed of this //bhakti. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. And when he's a //bhakta,// then he can understand what is God.

[aside:] Get the light on.

//Bhaktyā mām abhijānā...// No, there. That's all right.

**Indian man (2):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi for some time, a few English words] [break] [Hindi for some time] [end]
