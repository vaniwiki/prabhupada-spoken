====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...is taking place. The rascal Darwin says that it is coming from monkey. Why the monkey does not produce a human being? All rascals. //Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. Simply rascals.

**Pradyumna:**
Couldn't get his last. Ruby something.

**Pradyumna:**
He is a very nice gentleman. He appreciated //Bhagavad-gītā.// He said right away, very...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Pradyumna:**
My wife's typing up all your lectures.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Pradyumna:**
All your lectures. She has finished L.A. lectures. Now she is typing Māyāpur lectures, this lecture, that lecture. She has permanent machine and typewriter and apartment. So she types all during the day, and she minds the child. And then it is in the same apartment.

**Prabhupāda:**
Attending class also?

**Pradyumna:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Pradyumna:**
They live now across the street, in the temple apartments.

**Prabhupāda:**
In our house?

**Pradyumna:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Pradyumna:**
Typing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now this house will facilitate our business.

**Pradyumna:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just opposite the temple. So round about. Therefore I asked him, "Purchase these houses. Purchase." Never mind. So that is not lost. They were paying rent elsewhere. They can pay here. We get our permanent tenants.

**Pradyumna:**
Yes. All children live there, too. It is very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
So these houses. Now we have got four or five houses. Two houses of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust and three houses of M.V. Trust.

**Pradyumna:**
It will be a city. It's so nice, all the children live there together. Then next door there is Baladeva, that little boy with red hair. Aniruddha, he is blond hair, and another boy with red hair, he is next door, his best friend. They always play, all boys, children.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. And in the front house, there is ample space back there for children's play. This will facilitate. Very nice. And then one house after, there is another house.

**Pradyumna:**
Yes, up on the street, on our side of street.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Watseka. And that is Venice. On Venice we have got two house. The real estate men, they think of us very, very rich [laughs], after purchasing these houses. Here also, we can have very nice colony in this village. Yes. There are so many land; houses are for sale. If we can organize. Now you utilize these lands for growing fruit, flower, anything, whatever you can grow. But utilize this land. It doesn't matter what you would grow. Anything. Who will be in charge?

**Devotee:**
Bhaja Hari.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhaja Hari. Where is he?

**Devotee:**
He is in his office downstairs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Call him.

**Devotee:**
Now. Right away. His Divine Grace, Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Pradyumna:**
Orchards.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has come, Śyāmasundara?

**Pradyumna:**
Śyāmasundara is here.

**Devotee:**

**Prabhupāda:**
Get him also.

**Pradyumna:**
What time is it now?

**Śrutakīrti:**
About nine-thirty. The lady left her coat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Pradyumna:**
The lady left her coat. Maybe she is still here.

**Devotee (2):**
She's still downstairs.

Alright. [end]
