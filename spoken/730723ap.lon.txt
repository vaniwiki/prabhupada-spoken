====== Presentation Excerpt ======

**Guild member:**
...here are made of a very inferior metal, in fact in lead. But we couldn't think anything better than having this badge made for you in solid gold, twenty-four carat. And hereby we present it on behalf of the members of the Guild to you, our most beloved leader.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol, haribol!// [applause]

**Prabhupāda:**
So?

**Devotees:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
How it is to be used?

**Guild member:**
Just like this, m'Lord. Has a pin on it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, I see. Thank you.

Hmm.

[aside:] //Betiye, saheb. Idara chair ne.// [Hindi]

**Devotee:**
[quietly to Prabhupāda] //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// First Canto, first volume.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] Part One. Part One.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is Part One?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Betiye.// [end]
