His Excellency, the High Commissioner; ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very much for your coming here and participating in this ceremony, Janmāṣṭamī, advent of Kṛṣṇa. The subject matter I've been ordered to speak on is advent of Kṛṣṇa.

Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> janma karma me divyaṁ
> yo jānāti tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti mām eti kaunteya
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

This fact, that we can achieve such a stage of life when we can stop our birth and death... //Sa 'mṛtatvāya kalpate.// This morning, I was explaining this verse:

> yaṁ hi na vyathayanty ete
> puruṣaṁ puruṣarsabha
> sama-duḥkha-sukhaṁ dhīraṁ
> so 'mṛtatvāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:2:15|[Bg. 2.15]]]

//Amrtatva// means immortality. So the modern civilization, they have no idea, either the great philosopher, great politician or great scientist, that it is possible to attain the stage of immortality, //amṛtatva.// We are all //amṛta.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //na jāyate na mrīyate vā kadācin// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. We living entities, we never die, never take birth. //Nityaḥ śāśvato yaṁ, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. Every one of us, we are eternal, //nityaḥ, śāśvato; purāṇa,// the oldest. And after annihilation of this body, we do not die. //Na hanyate.// The body is finished, but I have to accept another body. //Tathā dehāntara prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati. Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]].

This simple thing, at the present moment they are lacking knowledge, that we, all living entities, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we are eternal, we are blissful and we are cognizant. Kṛṣṇa is described in the Vedic //śāstra://

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

//Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.// God, Kṛṣṇa... When I speak Kṛṣṇa, that means God. If there is any important name... God, it is sometimes said God has no name. That's a fact. But God's name is given by His activities. Just like Kṛṣṇa accepted the sonhood of Mahārāja Nanda or Yaśodāmāyī or Devakī or Vasudeva. Vasudeva and Devakī were Kṛṣṇa's real father and mother. Nobody is real father and mother of Kṛṣṇa, because Kṛṣṇa is the original father of everyone, but when Kṛṣṇa comes here, advents, He accepts some devotee as His father, as His mother.

Kṛṣṇa is the original, //ādi-puruṣaṁ. Ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣam nava-yauvanaṁ ca// [Bs. 5.33]. He is the original person. Then must be very old? No. //Adyam purāṇa puruṣam nava-yauvanam ca.// Always fresh youth. That is Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa was on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra---you have seen the picture---He's just like a boy of twenty years or, at utmost, twenty-four years old. But at that time, He had great-grandchildren. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa is always youth. //Navayauvanam ca.// These are the statements of Vedic literatures.

> advaitam acyutam anādiṁ ananta-rūpam
> ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca
> vedeṣu durlābhaṁ adurlābhaṁ ātmā-bhaktau
> [Bs. 5.33]

So, to understand Kṛṣṇa, simply if we read as a formality the Vedic literature, it will be very difficult to understand what is Kṛṣṇa, //vedesu durlābhaṁ,// although all the //Vedas// are meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. //Aham eva vedyo.// What is the use of studying //Vedas// if you do not understand Kṛṣṇa? Because the ultimate goal of education means to understand the Supreme Lord, the supreme father, the supreme cause. As it is said in the //Vedānta-sūtra, janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā. Brahma-jijñāsā,// to discuss about the Supreme Absolute Truth, Brahman. What is that Brahman? //Janmādy asya yataḥ.// That Brahman means wherefrom everything emanates.

So science, philosophy, //śāstras,// Vedic literature, that Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes. //Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam. Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam.//

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

Cause of all causes. Just like try to understand: I am, I am caused by my father. My father is caused by his father. He is caused by his father, his father... Go on searching, then you'll ultimately come to somebody who is the cause. But He has no cause. //Anādir ādir govindaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. I may be cause of my son, but I am also result of the cause, my father. But the //śāstra// says that //anādir ādir,// He is the original person, but He has no cause. That is Kṛṣṇa.

Therefore, Kṛṣṇa says that //janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. The advent of Kṛṣṇa, it is very important thing. We should try to understand Kṛṣṇa, why He advents, why He comes on this material world, what is His business, what are His activities. If we simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa, then what is the result? The result is //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. You get that immortality. The aim of life is to achieve immortality. //Amṛtatvāya kalpate.//

So in the advent of Kṛṣṇa, we shall try to understand the philosophy of Kṛṣṇa. His Excellency was speaking of peace. The peace formula is there, spoken by Kṛṣṇa. What is that?

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ
> sarva-loka-maheśvaram
> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati
> [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]

If the politicians, diplomats, they are trying to establish peace in the world... The United Nation is there, and there are many other organizations, they are trying to have real peace and tranquillity, no misunderstanding between man to man, nation to nation. But that is not happening. That is not happening. The defect is that in the root is wrong. Everyone's thinking, "It is my country. It is my family. It is my society. It is my property." This "mine" is illusion. In the //śāstra// it is said, //janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This "I and my" philosophy is illusion.

So this illusion means //māyā. Māyā...// If you want to get out of this illusion, //māyā,// then you have to accept the Kṛṣṇa's formula: //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.// Everything is there in the //Bhagavad-gītā// for guidance if we accept the philosophy of //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is. Everything is there. Peace is there, prosperity is there. So that is a fact. Unfortunately, we do not accept it. That is our misfortune. Or we misinterpret it. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Kṛṣṇa says that "You always think of Me," //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto,// "become My devotee"; //mad-yājī,// "you worship Me," //māṁ namaskuru,// "and offer obeisances unto Me." Is it very difficult task?

Here is Kṛṣṇa's Deity. If you think of this Deity, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, is it very difficult? //Man-manā.// You come into the temple and, just as a devotee, offer your respect to the Deity, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto.// As far as possible try to worship the Deity, //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. Kṛṣṇa does not want your whole property. Kṛṣṇa is open to the poorest man for being worshiped. What He is asking? He says, //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati:// "With devotion, if a person offers Me a little leaf, a little fruit, a little water, I accept." Kṛṣṇa is not hungry, but Kṛṣṇa wants to make you devotee. That is the main point. //Yo me bhaktyā prayacchati.// That is the main principle. If you offer Kṛṣṇa little things... Kṛṣṇa is not hungry; Kṛṣṇa is providing food for everyone. //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.// But Kṛṣṇa wants your love, your devotion. Therefore He is begging little //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ.//

//Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. There is no difficulty in understanding Kṛṣṇa and to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But we'll not do that; that is our disease. Otherwise, it is not difficult at all. And as soon as we become devotee of Kṛṣṇa, we understand the whole situation. Our philosophy, //Bhāgavata// philosophy, is also communism, because we consider Kṛṣṇa the supreme father, and all living entities, they are all sons of Kṛṣṇa.

So Kṛṣṇa says that He is the proprietor of all planets, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. Therefore whatever there is, either in the sky or in the water or in the land, they're all Kṛṣṇa's property. And because we are all sons of Kṛṣṇa, therefore every one of us has the right to use the father's property. But we should not encroach upon others. This is the formula of peace. //Mā gṛdha kasya svidhanam, īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. Everything belongs to God. You are sons of God. You have got the right to use father's property, but do not take more than you need. That is punishable. These things are stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Stena eva sa ucyate// [[books:bg:3:12|[Bg. 3.12]]], in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// "He's a thief." If anyone takes more than he needs, then he's a thief. //Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]]. If for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa... //Yajña// means Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's another name is Yajñeśvara. So you act for Kṛṣṇa, you take //prasādam,// Kṛṣṇa. That what we are teaching here. In this temple, we are residing Americans, Indians, Englishmen, Canadians, Africans---different parts of the world. You know that. Not only in this temple, all over the world.

[break] ...when we forget this philosophy, that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme father, Kṛṣṇa is the supreme proprietor, Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer and Kṛṣṇa is the supreme friend of everyone. When you forget this, then we come into this material world and struggle for existence, fight with one another. This is material life. So you cannot get... The politicians, diplomats or philosophers, they have tried so much, but actually nothing has become fruitful. Just like the United Nation: It was organized after the second great war, and they wanted that "Peacefully we shall settle everything." But there is no such thing. The fighting is going on between Pakistan and India, between Vietnam and America, and this and that. It is not the process.

The process is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Everyone has to understand this fact, that we are not proprietor. Proprietor is Kṛṣṇa. That's a fact. Just like America. Say two hundred years ago the Americans, the European migrators, they were not proprietor---somebody was proprietor. Before them, somebody was proprietor or it was vacant land. The actual proprietor is Kṛṣṇa. But artificially you are claiming that "It is my property." //Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This is called //māyā.//

So Kṛṣṇa advents for give us lesson. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, "My dear Arjuna, I come when there is discrepancies in the process of religious life." //Dharmasya glānir bhavati.// And what is //dharma?// The simple definition of //dharma// is //dharmāṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. This is //dharma. Dharmāṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam.// Whatever... Just like what do you mean by law? Law means the word given by the state. You cannot make law at home. That is not possible. Whatever the government gives you, that "You should act like this," that is law. Similarly, //dharma// means the direction given by God. That is //dharma.// Simple definition. You create //dharma.// I have created this //dharma,// another man creates another //dharma//---these are not //dharma.//

Therefore, where the //Bhagavad-gītā// ends, that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], this is //dharma//---to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Any other //dharma,// they are not //dharma.// Otherwise, why Kṛṣṇa asks, //sarva-dharmān parityajya:// "Give up"? He said that //dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge:// "I advent to establish the principles of religion." And at last He says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya.// That means the so-called //dharmas// that we have manufactured, man-made //dharma,// they are not //dharmas. Dharma// means what is given by God. But we have no understanding what is God and what is His word. That is the modern civilization defect. But the order is there, God is there---we won't accept. Where is the possibility of peace?

The order is there. Kṛṣṇa says, the Supreme, //bhagavān uvāca.// Vyāsadeva writes //bhagavān uvāca.// One should know what is Bhagavān. Vyāsadeva could have written //kṛṣṇa uvāca.// No. He says... If one may misunderstand Kṛṣṇa, therefore he writes in every stanza, every verse, //śrī bhagavān uvāca.// So Bhagavān is there. Bhagavān is speaking. Bhagavān is accepted by all the //ācāryas//---Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī; latest, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu , even Śaṅkarācārya, he also accepts Kṛṣṇa: //sa bhagavān svayaṁ kṛṣṇa.// So the verdict of the modern //ācāryas,// and in the past also, Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Asita, everyone accepted Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Arjuna, who heard from Kṛṣṇa, after understanding //Bhagavad-gītā// he said, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān puruṣam ādyaṁ śāśvatam// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]].

So everything is there. Especially in India, we have got so much asset for understanding God. Simple thing. Everything is there, ready made. But we won't accept. So what is the remedy for such disease? We are searching after peace, but we won't accept anything which is actually giving us peace. This is our disease.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to awaken the dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness in everyone's heart. Otherwise, how these Europeans and Americans and other countrymen, they never heard of Kṛṣṇa four or five years ago, how they are taking Kṛṣṇa consciousness so serious? Kṛṣṇa consciousness is there in everyone's heart. It has to be awakened only. That is described in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta://

> nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti 'sādhya' kabhu naya
> śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:107|[Cc. Madhya 22.107]]]

It is awakened. Love for Kṛṣṇa, devotion for Kṛṣṇa, is there within everyone's heart, but he has forgotten. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is simply meant for awakening that Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the process. Just like when you are sleeping, your..., I have to call you loudly---"Mr. Such-and-such, such and such, get up. You have got this business." No other senses will act when you are sleeping. But the ear will act. Therefore, in this age, when people are so fallen they will not hear anything, if we chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// he'll be awakened to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is practical.

So actually if we are anxious for peace and tranquillity in the society, then we must be very serious to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is our request. Don't take it neglectfully, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. This movement can solve all the problems of life, all the problems in the world---social, political, philosophical, religious, economical---everything can be solved by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore, we request those who are leaders---just like His Excellency is present here---you should try to understand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is very scientific, authorized. It is not a mental concoction or sentimental movement. It is most scientific movement. So we are inviting all leaders from all countries: try to understand. If you are sober, if you are actually reasonable, you'll understand that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the sublime movement for welfare of the whole human society. That's a fact. Anyone may come, we are prepared to discuss this subject matter. //Kṛṣṇa bhūliyā jīva bhoga vāñchā kare// [//Prema-vivarta// 6.2].

We should not... Our human life, the ultimate goal of human life, is to achieve immortality. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. This is our... We have forgotten this. We are simply leading the life of cats and dogs, without any knowledge that we can achieve that perfection of life when there will be no more birth, no more death. We do not understand even that there is possibility of //amṛtatvam.// But everything is possible. //Amṛtatvam.// Nobody wants to die, that's a fact. Nobody wants to become old man, nobody wants to become diseased. This is our natural inclination. Why? Because originally, in our spiritual form, there is no birth, no death, no old age, no disease. So after evolutionary process down from the aquatics, birds, beasts and plants, trees, when you come to this form of human form of body, after... //Aśītiṁ caturaś caiva lakṣāṁs tād jīva-jātiṣu// [//Brahmā-vaivarta Purāṇa//]. This is evolutionary process. We come to the human form of body. Then we should know what is the goal of life.

The goal of life is //amṛtatvam,// to become immortal. That, you can become immortal simply by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious. Kṛṣṇa says. It is a fact. We have to simply understand. //Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ.// If you try to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth, //tattvataḥ,// then, //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]], after giving up this body, you don't accept any more material body. And as soon as you don't accept any material body means you become immortal. Because by nature we are immortal.

So Kṛṣṇa advents, Kṛṣṇa advents to teach us this lesson, that "You are immortal by nature. As spirit soul you are part and parcel of Me. I am as immortal, so you are also immortal. Unnecessarily, you are trying to be happy in this material world."

> mamaivāṁso jīva bhūto
> jīva-loke sanātanaḥ
> manaḥ saṣṭanindriyāni
> prakṛti-sthāni karṣati
> [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]

Simply struggle for, unnecessarily. The best thing is that you have enjoyed sense life in so many varieties of life---as cats, as dogs, as demigod, as tree, as plants, as insect. Now, in this human form of life, don't be captivated by sensuous life. Just try to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is the verdict of the //śāstra. Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. To work very hard like dogs and hog for sense gratification is not the ambition of human life. Human life is meant for little austerity. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattvam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. We have to purify our existence. That is the mission of human life. Why I shall purify my //sattva,// existence? //Brahma-saukhyam tv anantam.// Then you get unlimited pleasure, unlimited happiness. That is real pleasure.

> ramante yogino 'nante 
> satyānanda-cid-ātmani 
> iti rāma-padenāsau 
> paraṁ brahmābhidhīyate 
> [[books:cc:madhya:9:29|[Cc. Madhya 9.29]]]

So at least in India, all the great personalities, saintly persons, sages and //ācāryas,// they have cultivated this spiritual knowledge so nicely and fully, and we are not taking advantage of it. It is not that those //śāstras// and directions are meant for the Indians or for the Hindus or for //brāhmaṇas.// No. It is meant for everyone. Because Kṛṣṇa claims,

> sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya
> sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ yaḥ
> tāsāṁ mahad brahma yonir
> ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā
> [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]

Kṛṣṇa claims that "I am everyone's father." Therefore, He is very much anxious to make us peaceful, happy. Just like the father wants to see his son is well-situated and happy; similarly, Kṛṣṇa also wants to see every one of us happy and well-situated. Therefore He comes sometimes. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. This is the purpose of Kṛṣṇa's advent.

So those who are servants of Kṛṣṇa, devotees of Kṛṣṇa, they should take the mission of Kṛṣṇa. They should take up the mission of Kṛṣṇa. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's version.

> āmāra ajñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa
> yare dekha, tare kaha, 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

//Kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.// Just try to preach what Kṛṣṇa has said in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is the duty of every Indian. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari para-upakāra.
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

So Indians, Indians are meant for //para-upakāra.// Indians are not meant for exploiting others. That is not Indians' business. Indian history is all along for //para-upakāra.// And formerly, from all parts of the world used to come to India to learn what is spiritual life. Even Jesus Christ went there, and from China and from other countries. That is history. And we are forgetting our own asset. How much we are callous. Such a great movement, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is going on all over the world, but our Indians are callous, our government is callous. They do not take. That is our misfortune. But it is the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. He says any Indian, //bhārata bhūmite manuṣya janma,// if he's human being, he must make his life perfect by taking advantage of this Vedic literature and distribute the knowledge all over the world. That is //para-upakāra.//

So India can do. They are actually appreciating. These Europeans, American young men, they are appreciating that how great... I get daily dozens of letter, how they are benefited by this movement. Actually, that is the fact. It is giving the life for the dead man. So I shall specially request the Indians, especially His Excellency, kindly cooperate with this movement, and try to make successful your life and others' life. That is the mission of Kṛṣṇa, advent of Kṛṣṇa.

Thank you very much. [end]
