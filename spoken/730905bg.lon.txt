**Prabhupāda:**
//...yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva pāvanāni manīṣiṇām.// There are four stages of spiritual life: the //brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// For //brahmacārī, yajña. Yajña// means to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān, viṣṇur ārādhyate// [[books:cc:madhya:8:58|[Cc. Madhya 8.58]]]. The whole scheme...

[aside:] I thinking I am feeling very hot. I have to take off...

In another place it is said, //yajñārthāt karmaṇaḥ anyatra karma-bandhanaḥ// [[books:bg:3:9|[Bg. 3.9]]].

[sounds of Prabhupāda's sweater being removed]

[aside:] Hmm. That's all right. That's all right. Keep it now.

So //brahmacārī,// in the beginning of life---//brahmacārī// means beginning of life, student life---they must be trained up how to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the first training. The //brahmacārī// is trained up to rise early in the morning and offers fire sacrifice, then studies of //Vedas,// then //saṅkīrtana.// There are so many routine work for //brahmacārī.// So this must be executed. And for //gṛhastha, dāna,// charity. //Gṛhastha// must be prepared or trained up to give charity. And who will accept the charity? The charity will be accepted by the //brahmacārī// and //sannyāsa.// Not the //vānaprastha. Brahmacārī// will accept charity on behalf of the spiritual master. And a //sannyāsī// will accept charity only for his maintenance. That's all.

The //gṛhastha// cannot accept charity. But a //gṛhastha-brāhmaṇa,// he can accept charity, but he will not, I mean to say, accumulate money by taking charity. Whatever he gets, he must spend then. //Dāna-pratigraha. Pratigraha// means accept. But he cannot keep in bank, a bank balance. He must, whatever extra he has got, he must immediately give in charity. Then he can accept, a //gṛhastha-brāhmaṇa,// accept charity. There is a proverb in Bengali that "A //brāhmaṇa,// even if he gets one //lakh// of rupees, one hundred thousands of rupees, still he is a beggar." Because he will not keep it. He will not keep it for... He will immediately distribute it in charity. Therefore he is called in Bengali //lakh take baundigi.//[?] It doesn't matter he gets one //lakh// of rupees' contribution, but still he remains a beggar, because immediately he will distribute. So these things are very important things. //Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ.// And for //sannyāsī// and //vānaprastha---tapasya. Tapo divyam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Tapasya// means accepting voluntarily all kinds of inconveniences. Voluntarily.

Now, the material activities are that we are trying to avoid inconveniences. Material life is. But spiritual life means to execute //tapasya,// austerity, penance, even at the risk of all inconveniences. This is called //tapasya.// So Kṛṣṇa says, //yajña-dāna-tapaḥ kriyāḥ na tyājyam.// You can give up your family life, but you cannot give up this //yajña-dāna-tapaḥ.// That you cannot, at any circumstances. These things must be continued. //Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat. Kāryam// means "must"; you must perform. The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs, karma-tyāgī,// they do not work. Their principle is always study //Vedānta// philosophy, and whatever they require, a little, they will beg, taking alms from //gṛhasthas,// and live and follow the strictly the principles of austerity. They are very strict. Those who are really Māyāvādī //sannyāsī,// not false, they follow strictly three times taking bathing. Even in severest cold they must. They lie down on the floor and always read //Vedānta// and Sāṅkhya philosophy. But in spite of all these austerities, they do not approve the worship of Deity, the transcendental form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because they are impersonalist, they do not worship.

So //śāstra// says that //ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. So these people, although they are thinking of themself as liberated, they have become liberated... The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// address amongst themselves: //namo nārāyaṇa. Namo nārāyaṇa// means every one of them has become a Nārāyaṇa. This is their philosophy. And from this //namo nārāyaṇa// principle, Vivekananda Swami has manufactured the word //daridra-nārāyaṇa.// So Nārāyaṇa has become very cheap thing for them. Everyone has become Nārāyaṇa. Everyone has become God. Just they say the rascal God is now in the hospital. God is under operation. [laughter] A "//guruji//" God. So they have no shame even, that "If I am God, I cannot cure my bodily pains, what kind of God I am?" But these rascals will proclaim that they are God, and there is set of rascals, they will accept, "Oh, here is God." Vivekananda also said that "Why you are finding out God? Don't you see, so many Gods are loitering in the street?"

So God has become a funny thing for them. No. We do not accept such God. Our God is different. Our God is:

> yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ
> brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ
> samatvenaiva vīkṣeta
> sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam
> [[books:cc:madhya:18:116|[Cc. Madhya 18.116]]]

Our Nārāyaṇa---that is real Nārāyaṇa, exalted---we cannot even compare with that supreme Nārāyaṇa with such demigods like Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, what to speak of these rascals. //Yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ, samatvena vīkṣeta.// Any person, rascal, if he thinks that Nārāyaṇa is equal to Lord Brahmā or Lord Śiva... There are Māyāvādīs, they say, "Any demigod is as good as Viṣṇu. You can worship any demigod. It doesn't matter. You..." Because their ultimate understanding is that the Absolute Truth is impersonal, and you can imagine any form, it doesn't matter; you ultimately reach that impersonal, merge into the impersonal. This is their philosophy.

But that is not the fact. The ultimate issue of the Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa, Bhagavān. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases: first of all impersonal Brahman, then localized Paramātmā, and then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. The Absolute Truth is described as Bhagavān, and there are many expansions of Bhagavān. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. //Ananta-rūpa.// Kṛṣṇa has expansion, millions and trillions. Just like as Paramātmā. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Not only He resides in everyone's heart, but in every atom also. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi// [Bs. 5.35].

So Kṛṣṇa has got many expansions, but they are all one. //Advaita acyuta.// Just like you have got experience that the sun, if you have got millions of pots, the sun is reflected. You will find millions of suns. But although the sun is one, but we see that millions of suns are there in millions of pots. This is the understanding. God is one, but He can expand Himself in millions and millions. There is no question of counting. Unlimited, but still one. //Advaita. Acyuta.// The Māyāvādī philosophy is that because God has expanded Himself in so many, all-pervading, therefore He is finished. He is finished. Just like material conception: You take any big paper and make it into pieces and then throw it---the original paper is lost. There is no more existing. That is Māyāvādī philosophy. Māyāvādī philosophy means because God is all-pervading, therefore He has no form. He has finished His form. There cannot be any form. And this is material conception. This is not spiritual conception.

Spiritual conception is //pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam eva avaśiṣyate// [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]. If Kṛṣṇa is the complete, supreme, so even He expands Himself in millions and trillions of complete form, still, He is complete. Still, He's complete. This is conception of Kṛṣṇa. So therefore //avyaya. Avyaya// means //acyuta, avyaya. Acyuta// means He does not fall. It is not like that, that in my bank I have got one hundred pounds; if I take one, two, three, four, five in this way, one hundred finished, my bank balance is finished. It is not like that. Kṛṣṇa is so complete that immediate forms may be expanded from Him; still, He is complete. //Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya.// These verses you have already read in the //Īśopaniṣad.// So that is the conception of Kṛṣṇa.

So unless you, from the very beginning, you practice //yajña,// or if you are a //gṛhastha,// give in charity, and when you take //sannyāsa,// you undergo //tapasya,// how you will understand this philosophy? It is not possible. In the Kali-yuga, however, this //yajña// is not possible. As there are ritualistic //yajña,// sacrifice, as recommended in the //Vedas,// that is not possible. It is very expensive. You have to acquire so much //ghee// and grains and so many other things. Feed so many, daily, people. It is very difficult task to perform the ritualistic //yajña.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa has made easy. What is that? //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ.// That is recommended in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ
> sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
> yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair
> yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ
> [SB 11.5.32]

This is the process of performing //yajñas. Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ.// What is that //yajña? Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam. Kṛṣṇa-varṇam. Varṇa// means category. Just like //brāhmaṇa-varṇa, cātur-varṇa. Varṇa// means class. //Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]], as Kṛṣṇa said. So //kṛṣṇa-varṇam:// in the category of Kṛṣṇa. So //kṛṣṇa-varṇa.// Or "one who is describing Kṛṣṇa," //varṇayati. Kṛṣṇaṁ varṇayati iti kṛṣṇa, iti kṛṣṇa-varṇa.// Either belonging to the category of Kṛṣṇa... He is not belonging to the category of the //jīva// soul. He belongs to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //kṛṣṇa-varṇa.// Or chanting always the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣā akṛṣṇam.// Means He is Kṛṣṇa... Because He belongs to the category of Kṛṣṇa, therefore He is Kṛṣṇa.

But we have got conception, Kṛṣṇa is blackish. Yes, that's a fact. //Asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam. Asita. Asita// means black. //Asitāmbuda.// So black cloud. //Ambuda// means cloud. //Asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam.// His complexion is like blackish cloud, but very, very, very, very beautiful. //Kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīyam.// He is so beautiful that many millions of Cupid cannot be compared with Him, although He is blackish. So here the same Kṛṣṇa, //kṛṣṇa-varṇam,// although He belongs to the same category of Kṛṣṇa, //tviṣā,// by complexion, //akṛṣṇa. Akṛṣṇa. Akṛṣṇa// means "not //kṛṣṇa.//" So it may be any other color. It may be... There are so many colors. So //akṛṣṇa.// He's not //kṛṣṇa,// not blackish. So there may be...

But no. There are fixed colors for the Supreme Personality of Godhead. //Śukla, śuklo raktas tathā pīta idānīṁ kṛṣṇatāṁ gataḥ.// When Kṛṣṇa was born at Nanda Mahārāja's place, or Kṛṣṇa appeared, then... So according to Vedic system there is //jāta-karma.// As soon as child is born, immediately horoscope is made, and according to horoscope his name is given. There are //daśa-karma. Daśa-karma.// So one of these is at the birth, that before the child is begotten, there is one //saṁskāra, garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.// Similarly, after the child is born, then another //saṁskāra, jāta-karma-saṁskāra.// So there are so many //saṁskāras. Saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ:// By following the //saṁskāra,// purificatory process, one becomes //brāhmaṇa:// the //upanayana-saṁskāra,// the sacred thread //saṁskāra.//

So when Kṛṣṇa was having the //jāta-karma-saṁskāra// by Gargamuni, the priest of Vasudeva... He was sent to Nanda Mahārāja to perform the Kṛṣṇa's //jāta-karma.// So he was a learned astrologer. He said, "Nanda Mahārāja, your this son formerly had three other colors." //Śuklo raktas tathā pīta.// "He was of white color, He was of red color, He was of yellow color." //Idānīṁ kṛṣṇatāṁ gataḥ.// "Now He has appeared in blackish color." //Idānīṁ kṛṣṇatāṁ gataḥ.// So //kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam// [SB 11.5.32]. //Tviṣā// means by complexion He is not black. Then He must be either of the three---white, red and yellow.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu's color is yellowish golden color. Therefore it is said, "He is Kṛṣṇa, but now He has appeared in golden complexion." //Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣā akṛṣṇam.// And //sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam:// "He is always surrounded by His associates." //Aṅga, upāṅga. Aṅga// means personal, and //upāṅga// means expansion of the expansion, which is called //kalā.// The first expansion is called //avatāra,// and when there is another //avatāra// from //avatāra,// that is called //kalā. Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan// [Bs. 5.39]. There is scientific analysis in the //śāstra.// Not that any rascal comes, "I am God." This is not acceptable. We have to understand //śāstra-vidhi,// as //śāstra// it is said.

So about Śrī Cai... Because Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so many rascals have imitated: "Well, this Nimāi Paṇḍita, if He can become //avatāra,// then why not GadadharPaṇḍita?" This Ramakrishna, his name was Gadadhar Chatterjee. So he was also imitation of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Where is the reference in the //śāstra?// So far Caitanya Mahāprabhu is concerned, there are so many innumerable references, in //Mahābhārata,// in //Bhāgavata,// in //Purāṇa,// in //Upaniṣad.// Therefore we accept Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not by rascal's vote, that "Let us vote this man is God; then he becomes."

So //kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam// [SB 11.5.32]. He associated with other devotees---Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu, then Gadādhara Prabhu and Śrīnivāsa.

> śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya
> prabhu-nityānanda
> śrī-advaita gadādhara
> śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda

Whenever Caitanya Mahāprabhu is present, there are so many devotees. //Gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.// So //sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam.// This is the incarnation of Kali-yuga.

So //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. Those who have got brain substance, not dull, filled up with cow dung, they cannot understand what is the //saṅkīrtana-yajña.// But //śāstra// says, //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ:// "Those who have got nice brain substance, they can perform this //yajña, saṅkīrtana-yajña.//" Then it fulfills the injunction of the //Bhagavad-gītā, yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyāḥ// [[books:bg:17:24|[Bg. 17.24]]]. So for this //saṅkīrtana// movement, //saṅkīrtana-yajña,// in this age, before the Deity of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu and associated withNityānanda, Advaita, others... If not all, at least Nityānanda or Gadādhara. Gaura-Gadādhara or Gaura-Nityānanda, or all of them, five. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda.// You have got Pañca-tattva? No picture here? It was there.

**Devotee:**
When... Revatīnandana Swami takes with him traveling.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, all right. So Gaura-Nityānanda is here. That's all right. So this is the //yajña.// So //yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyam.// You cannot give up in any stage of life, but because the //yajñas// mentioned in the //Vedas// it is not possible to perform in this age, Kali-yuga, because they are //mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. In this age people may advertise themselves they are making very much progress---they are all unfortunate, disturbed. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyāḥ. Manda-bhāgyāḥ// means unfortunate. And //upadrutāḥ,// always disturbed. This is the position of the people in this age. How they can perform the Vedic ritualistic ceremony? It is not possible. So this is the //yajña.//

So //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ,// you keep Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and perform //yajña,// the //saṅkīrtana-yajña,// before Him, and you become all-perfect. So easy. So easy. Because you cannot give up //yajña.// But in this age, Kali-yuga, people are so unfortunate, so rubbish, that it is not possible to perform the Vedic ritualistic //yajña.// That is not possible. Therefore Kṛṣṇa has given you the opportunity that you can perform. //Kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt. Kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ// [SB 12.3.52]. //Makha// means //yajña.// That was being performed in the Tretā-yuga. And in the Satya-yuga, meditation. In the Dvāpara-yuga, Deity worship. //Kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt.// In the Kali-yuga, simply by //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya// [SB 12.3.51]. And this is the //śāstra's// injunction.

So I am very pleased that you are keeping this center nicely in our own standard by performing //yajña,// by //saṅkīrtana,// and today is Rādhāṣṭamī. You perform. Our //yajña// is //saṅkīrtana,// and Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī is the pleasure potency of Kṛṣṇa. //Rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād ekātmānāv api deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau, śrī-caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptam// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. When Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa is one, //ekam advitīyam.// But //eko bahu syāt,// He can expand Himself. So when He wants to enjoy, so the pleasure potency is manifested from His personal body. That pleasure potency is Rādhārāṇī. Rādhārāṇī is not ordinary living entity. Rādhārāṇī is Kṛṣṇa's personal pleasure potency, //hlādinī-śakti.//

So just today is the appearance day of //hlādinī-śakti.// So if you want to please Kṛṣṇa... Because our business is to please Kṛṣṇa. //Hari-toṣaṇam.// Our this movement is //hari-toṣaṇam. Saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam. Ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ. Varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ. Svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam// [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]. Not only our. This is the aim. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is also said, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. The whole Vedic literature is meant for searching out Kṛṣṇa and to satisfy. So Kṛṣṇa personally comes to give you the information. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You rascal, you give up all these engagements. Simply you surrender unto Me."

And what about other demigods? There are so many demigods. What we have to do? //Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]: "This demigod is worshiped by persons who have lost all intelligence." //Hṛta-jñāna. Hṛta-jñāna// means //naṣṭa-buddhayaḥ,// one who has lost intelligence. There is no need. Simply //mām ekam.// That is the instruction of //Bhagavad...// That is the //śāstra// instruction. //Viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam. Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. //Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti// [//Ṛg Veda// 1.22.20]. This is //Ṛg Veda mantra.// Actual aim of life is to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu, and Kṛṣṇa is the origin of //viṣṇu-tattva.// And He is pleased through Rādhārāṇī. Therefore we don't keep Kṛṣṇa alone. No. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. First Rādhārāṇī.

So that day is today. First you have to worship Rādhārāṇī. If you go through Rādhārāṇī... Therefore in Vṛndāvana you will see all devotees, they will address one another, "//Jaya Rādhe.//" Still. Because they know that "If Rādhārāṇī is pleased, if I can please Rādhārāṇī..." Rādhārāṇī is presented the original pleasure potency, always absorbed in thought of Kṛṣṇa. So anyone who comes before Rādhārāṇī to serve Kṛṣṇa, oh, She becomes so pleased, "Oh, here is a devotee of Kṛṣṇa." She immediately recommends, "Kṛṣṇa, oh, here is a devotee. He is better than Me." This is Rādhārāṇī. I may be a..., not devotee. I may be most fallen rascal. But if I try to reach Kṛṣṇa through Rādhārāṇī, then my business is successful. Therefore we should worship Rādhārāṇī first. That is our business. Instead of offering directly one flower to Kṛṣṇa, you just put it in the hands of Rādhārāṇī: "My mother Rādhārāṇī, //jagan-mātā,// if You kindly take this flower and offer it to Kṛṣṇa." "Oh," Rādhārāṇī says, "Oh, you have brought a flower?" Kṛṣṇa said, //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]], but don't try to offer Kṛṣṇa directly. Just offer through Rādhārāṇī. It will be very much appreciated by Rādhārāṇī.

So this is our philosophy, to please Kṛṣṇa through Rādhārāṇī, and just today is the auspicious day of Rādhārāṇī's appearance. So we should offer //puṣpāñjali// and pray to Rādhārāṇī that "Rādhārāṇī, kindly be merciful and tell about me to Your Kṛṣṇa. To Your Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is Yours." Kṛṣṇa, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is not independent. Kṛṣṇa is Rādhārāṇī's property. So you have to approach Kṛṣṇa through Rādhārāṇī. That is, today is the auspicious day. Worship Rādhārāṇī very nicely and be happy.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
