====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Western side it should be less. Now in America it is early in the morning.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Half-past four. Eleven hours' difference. In Los Angeles.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Eleven to Los Angeles? It is five to London, four and a half to five. From London to Los Angeles, it is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Six hours.

**Śyāmasundara:**
I think it is eight.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? No.

**Śyāmasundara:**
It is five to New York from London.

**Prabhupāda:**
And three hours.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Three more.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You have seen my watch there, that Karāndhara has purchased?

**Śyāmasundara:**
I heard four different watches are there, four clocks. It's an international clock.

**Brahmānanda:**
International clock, time zone clock.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Twenty-four...

**Brahmānanda:**
It will give you the exact time in any one of the time zones in the world. There is a map, and you dial.

**Prabhupāda:**
Latitude, according to latitude. All the cities at the same time.

**Brahmānanda:**
It is a computer clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can simply lower the button and you get time all over the world.

**Brahmānanda:**
A.m. or p.m.

**Prabhupāda:**
Two hundred and twenty dollars.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Two hundred and fifty dollars.

**Devotee (2):**
Does it give the temperature also?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. His name is there, the blind[?] is there.

**Śyāmasundara:**
You dial it.

**Prabhupāda:**
The time is light.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] time.

**Brahmānanda:**
And when it changes, it gives a click.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Brahmānanda:**
When it changes, the minute changes, there's a little click.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Do you still have that watch I got you once, that computer watch?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, he has...

**Prabhupāda:**
Broke it. [laughter] [indistinct] pressing it too much.

**Brahmānanda:**
In order to change the time.

**Devotees:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
That broke it.

**Devotee:**
Broke.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Is it fixed yet?

**Devotee:**
Oh, yes, it is fixed now.

**Devotee (2):**
It cost about twenty dollars.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee (2):**
It costs twenty dollars, I think, to have it fixed. But now it's working.

**Brahmānanda:**
Prabhupāda spoke to collaborate the computer watch and the computer on his desk. So both are exactly the same.

**Devotee (2):**
Every day, every year be the same.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Doesn't change. Supposed to be...

**Prabhupāda:**
I was talking in London. I was giving time to someone.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Someone was calling you from Los Angeles?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. Prabhupāda would dial and say, "Oh, call Śyāmasundara. What time is it?" So he would dial the time, and it was five o'clock in the morning.

**Śyāmasundara:**
[laughs] That's good. Specially for...

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] calls. Those who are internationally collect, for them that's important.

**Brahmānanda:**
Someone has just lent me this.

**Prabhupāda:**
What it is?

**Brahmānanda:**
[loud buzzing noise] Alarm watch, to remind me to go to //kīrtana.// [loud buzzing noise]

**Prabhupāda:**
Made in?

**Brahmānanda:**
Switzerland.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are making wonderful achievement in the material world. That is no doubt. Not very much. We are under Lord Kṛṣṇa's side, when you stop death; otherwise it is [indistinct]. That is Kṛṣṇa's movement. We are understood in the beginning, where you can stop death. That is not...

**Śyāmasundara:**
There is one scientist now who has discovered in the old people's bodies a certain hormone, or chemical, and his theory is that if he can find out the source of that chemical and stop it, that we can live for ever. We can live for a long time.

**Prabhupāda:**
They will never find it. [laughter] No. The yogic process is the same---they keep the hormone fresh.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the way. If you keep the hormone fresh, then you can... So long it is fresh, you cannot die.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Ah.

**Prabhupāda:**
He'll have to die. Just like the bank balance, you have got one thousand dollars. You don't spend---the money is there. So yogic process is like that. That //samādhi...// It becomes //samādhi,// no breathing. That means you don't spend. You have got a limited breathing duration, and if you don't spend it, then you can live. That is yogic process: breathing control. They don't breathe. Suppose I am breathing ten thousand times daily. So if I don't breathe, that ten thousand rupees is in my stock as bank balance.

**Śyāmasundara:**
[laughs] Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the point. But you cannot be immortal.

**Devotee:**
Im...?

**Prabhupāda:**
The balance, it expend... What is called?

**Brahmānanda:**
Expendable?

**Devotee:**
Expendable.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But you don't expend---so much gain. Not that you can increase. Bank balance, you have got one thousand dollars. If you don't spend, it is always one thousand dollars.

**Brahmānanda:**
What about interest? No interest?

**Śyāmasundara:**
No interest.

**Brahmānanda:**
No interest.

**Prabhupāda:**
No interest. Checking account there is no interest. [laughter]

**Śyāmasundara:**
Swiss account.

**Prabhupāda:**
No interest. Not obligatory. [laughter] When it is bank book account, then it is...

**Devotee:**
That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Brahmānanda:**
Automatic.

**Prabhupāda:**
So the yogic process is like that. But that is not the process of check, stopping death. You can delay death. That you can delay, so it's a hundred years, two hundred years, five hundred years, or even more than that. You can delay, but it is not that stoppage.

**Śyāmasundara:**
But you have to spend something. Your heart has to beat.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Samādhi,// I think heart goes on, breathing stops.

**Devotee:**
Hmm.

**Śyāmasundara:**
How does..., how does the skin stay alive, everything keeping from corruption?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, the breathing... Just like in the tree there is no breathing, but that does not mean they are dead. Breathing is not death. This is their nonsense science: "Stoppage of breathing is death." At least in... No. The heart beating is also stopped.

**Śyāmasundara:**
Hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
He breathes very slow, almost like stopped, but he breathes. [end]
