====== Lecture at Pandal ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...I spoke in Hindi. Now today I speak in English. If required I shall again speak in Hindi tomorrow. In this way, alternatively.

So we are worshiping Kṛṣṇa. His simple business is, as we have described, Rādhā-Mādhava, He is lover of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī. Kṛṣṇa means lover. This very word //Kṛṣṇa// means "all-attractive." You can attract by your love, not by anything else. Therefore His name is Kṛṣṇa. I have read one book, //Aquarian Gospel,// among the Christians. In that book it is said that the word //Christ// has come from the word //Christo. Christo,// it is a Greek word, and the meaning of //Christo// is "lover," "anointed." So I think the word //Christ// is //apabhraṁśa// of //Christo,// and //Christo...// In India still, if one's name is Kṛṣṇa, we call him Kriṣṭa, or sometimes Keṣṭa. My younger brother, his name was Kṛṣṇa. So in family we were calling him "Keṣṭa." That is very current. So actually //love,// the word //love,// has come from //Kṛṣṇa.// That is a fact. Therefore you will see always Kṛṣṇa always with Rādhārāṇī. We worship Kṛṣṇa---Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, Sītā-Rāma. This is Vaiṣṇava's worshipable Deity. We do not worship alone God. We Vaiṣṇava, we want to see Kṛṣṇa and His energy, potency. That is Vedic system.

In the //Vedas// it is said, //Upaniṣad, parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.//

> na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate
> na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate
> parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate
> svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca
> [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, 
> Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]

The Supreme Absolute Truth, He has nothing to do. He has nothing to do. //Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate.// He has nothing to do. Everything is being done by His potencies. Just like a big man, a big business man, or a big, the president of the state, he personally does not do anything. But his energies, his secretaries and others, they do everything. He simply signs or gives sanction. So this is the fact. God has nothing to do. Everything is being done very nicely by His energies. Just like the sunshine or the sun planet is one of the energies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the whole material world is being conducted very nicely by the sunshine. This is scientific. Due to the sunshine, all the planets, they are rotating in their prescribed orbit, and nobody is colliding with one another. Everything is going nicely, sunshine. Due to sunshine, the seasonal changes are taking place, and the varieties of trees, plants are growing. Everything is going on. The moon is also working under sunshine. And due to the moon, there are waves in the sea. There are changes of the ebb tide and flow tide. So one energy of the sunshine is doing so much things.

So //parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya// 13.65, //purport//]. His energies are working so nicely that //svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca. Svabhāva. Svabhāva// means natural. Just like a rose flower is coming into existence, very nicely painted, very nicely colored, very nicely flavored. So it requires brain. How you can say that it has been done automatically? No. There is brain. That is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā: mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. The nature is working under His direction. But His direction is so complete that it appears to us as it is being done automatically. Not automatic. There is brain behind it. Just like nowadays there are so many mechanical invention. You just push one button and things come, as we see in the airplane, there are simply..., the pilot is working simply by pushing some buttons, and such a big, gigantic plane is floating in the sky. We can understand. The television, simply by pushing one button... So if materially it is so much advanced, perfection is possible, you can just imagine spiritually how much it is perfectly possible.

So this perfection of love... We are also after love. A young man is after love; a young boy is after love. So wherefrom this love comes? Because originally the love is there in Kṛṣṇa. That is the version of the //Vedānta-sūtra. Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. //Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante// [Taittirīya Upaniṣad 3.1]. So this loving affair has come from the Supreme Absolute Truth, but it is pervertedly reflected only. Pervertedly reflected. //Yatra tri-sargaḥ amṛṣā.// Here in the material world we are simply seeing the perverted reflection of the spiritual world. Therefore in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said, in the beginning,

> janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ
> tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ
> tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ yatra tri-sargo 'mṛṣā
> dhāmnā svena nirasta-kuhakaṁ satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi
> [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]

//Satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi.// Here everything is perverted---reflection, shadow. The example is given, just like in the desert, sometimes we find water. The reflection of the sunshine makes a false replica of water, exactly. But there is no water. There is no water, and the reflection of water. Similarly, in this material world there is only reflection of that love. Actually, there is no love. It is the mirage in the desert. Therefore, if we want really love, this word can be applied only to Kṛṣṇa, all-attractive.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is just to teach people not to be allured by the illusory so-called water and love or anything. There is one reality: //satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Just try to come to the real reality. Don't be entrapped by the false reality. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness move... We are entrapped by the false reality, //māyā. Māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvat// [SB 11.5.34]. //Māyā...// Just like the deer, he runs over the false water in the desert. But the water goes ahead more and more, and the poor animal, without finding water, dies. But a sane man does not go. A sane man knows that reflection of water is not water. But that does not mean... Because there is no water in the desert, it does not mean that there is no water. The water is there, but not in the desert. That is knowledge.

Therefore we were discussing last night this verse, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā. Jīvasya,// every living entity, should be inquisitive to know where is real pleasure. Because we are hunting after pleasure, everyone. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. Because we are by nature //ānandamaya,// because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. //Mamaivāṁśaḥ,// Kṛṣṇa says. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1]. //Sat, cit, ānanda.// He is personified, //sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha. Vigraha// means person or the form, transcendental form, of //sac-cid-ānanda. Sat// means eternity, and //cit// means knowledge, and //ānanda,// pleasure. His body is //sac-cid-ānanda.// But our body is not //sac-cid-ānanda,// this present body, the material body. It is neither //sat,// because it is temporary; therefore it is not //sat.// And //cit.// Oh, we are ignorant in so many things. There is no knowledge. //Abodha-jāta.// This body means ignorance. This material body means ignorance. //Abodha-jāta.//

That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: parābhavas tāvad abodha-jātaḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:5|[SB 5.5.5]]]. //Abodha-jāta// means the embodiment of ignorance. We do not know so many things. In our own body... I am claiming, "It is my body," but I do not know how the body is working, how we are taking food, how it is being transferred into different secretions, then the secretion is going to the heart. And we know something by the medical science, but it is not perfect. Medical science fails. Although I am claiming... I do not know, at least. The physician may know, the medical man may know, but I am claiming, "I am this body," but I do not know how it is working. Therefore we are all //abodha-jāta. Abodha-jāta.//

Therefore our business is to inquire about the truth. This is explained in this verse, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.// This human life should be engaged for inquiring about the truth, anything, either of this body or of this material nature or about God, our interrelationship---so many things there have to be known. Therefore in this verse it is said that //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.// It is not our only business that simply to eat, sleep and have sex life and defend. That is not our only business. That may be the business of the cats and dogs, but human life is not meant for that purpose. The civilization should be so molded that people will have the chance to think soberly about the truth of life. That is the perf... That is called //tattva-jijñāsā.//

For this purpose the Vedic civilization is perfect. Vedic civilization is for everyone, but nowadays it is said that it is for the Indians or for the Hindus or... But actually, it is meant for everyone. Just like here it is said, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.// It is everyone's duty to inquire about the Absolute Truth. Where is the question of Hindu, Muslim or this or that? Truth is truth. "Two plus two equal to four," it is accepted by the Hindus, Muslim, Christian and everyone. Science is science. So therefore we should be interested about inquiring. This is the confirmation in every scripture; in the //Bhāgavata// also. This is also //Bhāgavata.//

In //Bhāgavata,// in another place it is said, //tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]: "Those who are actually inquisitive to know the value of life, the Absolute Truth, he must approach a //guru.//" Here also it is said, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā. Jijñāsā// means somebody in inferior position inquires from the superior man. Then there is //jijñāsā.// Just like a child inquires from his father. Intelligent child always inquires, "Father, what is this? What is this? What is this?" and father explains. In this way the child gets experience. So similarly, here it is said that //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.// Every human being... It is human being. //Jīvasya,// the general meaning is all living entity, but all living entity cannot inquire. That is not possible. The cats and dogs, they cannot inquire. There are 8,400,000 species of life, out of which this human form of life is competent to inquire about the Truth. Therefore here it is said, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā nārtho yaś ceha karmabhiḥ.//

Now another place in //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that,

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

So from whom you'll have to inquire? From a person who has actually seen what is //tattva,// what is truth. From him. Therefore I was speaking yesterday, last night, in Hindi, that the //tattva// is not to be inquired from a //pān-wala// or //biḍi-wala.// No. One who has actually seen the //tattva, tattva-darśī.//

So according to Vedic scripture, a //tattva-darśī// should be very pure, uncontaminated. Therefore, generally we go to the qualified //brāhmaṇa, satyaṁ śamo damas titikṣā ārjavam, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. One who is qualified. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. So according to Vedic system, a //guru,// generally, he must be a //brāhmaṇa.// Any //guru.// It doesn't matter, it doesn't require that he is to take birth in a //brāhmaṇa// family. If he is qualified, then he is //guru.// If he is not qualified, then he cannot become //guru.// Even becoming a //brāhmaṇa,// qualified //brāhmaṇa,// one does not become a //guru// if he is not a Vaiṣṇava. That is the injunction of the //śāstra.//

> ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro
> mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ
> avaiṣṇavo gurur na syād
> sad-vaiṣṇavaḥ śva-paco guruḥ
> [Padma Purāṇa]

//Sad-vaiṣṇava.// One has to become Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava means one who is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore Kṛṣṇa instructed Arjuna. He said, //bhakto 'si priyo 'si// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]: "Because you are My //bhakta,// therefore I am talking to you." So //guru// means a Vaiṣṇava. He must be a representative of Kṛṣṇa.

Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, supreme //guru.// He is the first //guru. Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Kṛṣṇa imparted knowledge to the original person, Brahmā. You may inquire that "Brahmā is the original person. There was nobody present. Then who became his //guru?//" No. That is explained: //tene brahma hṛdā,// "From through the heart." Kṛṣṇa, or God, is situated in everyone's heart. As you become purified, He speaks. He speaks always, but in our impure condition, we cannot hear. Just like in //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said also,

> sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo
> mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca
> vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo
> vedānta-kṛd vedānta-vid ca aham
> [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]

So as Paramātmā, Supersoul, Kṛṣṇa is always prepared, ready to help every one of us, but provided we take His advice, take His instruction. He says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ
> bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam
> buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ
> yena mām upayānti te
> [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]

Those who are //satata-yuktānām,// means twenty-four hours engaged... //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatām.// In which business engagement? //Bhajatām,// in the devotional service. Such person, //bhajatām.// What kind of //bhajatām? Prīti-pūrvakam:// with love and affection. Such person, //buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam.// So what kind of //buddhi-yogam?// This //tattva-jijñāsā, yena mām upayānti te.// "This such instruction by which one can approach Me, one can understand Me," //upayānti.// In another place Kṛṣṇa says, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]].

So here also it is said, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.// So if we want to know the //tattva,// the Absolute Truth, then we have to go through the process. That process is simply to engage oneself in the loving service of the Lord. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. By these blunt senses, materially blunt... Just like with blunt instrument you cannot take any benefit---it must be sharpened---similarly these senses, you utilize these senses to understand the Absolute Truth, but it must be purified, sharpened. Just like a knife: when it is sharpened, it cuts very nicely; if it is blunt, it does not. But you can use the same very knife. So you can use these very eyes. Now you cannot see God, or Kṛṣṇa. But if you purify these eyes, if you purify the senses, you can see God, you can talk with God, you can serve God, everything. That is possible. That is //bhakti.//

//Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. We have to purify the senses. Now I am thinking, "This hand is my hand" or "This hand is my society's hand," "my family's hand" or "my nation's hand," "my community's hand." //Upādhi,// designation. But actually, this hand belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and therefore this hand should be used for Kṛṣṇa's purpose, not for anything else. That is called //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam.// Purify. Actually that. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's name is Hṛṣīkeśa. When these senses are purified, then with that purified senses, //hṛṣīkeṇa---hṛṣīkeṇa// means senses, by these senses---//hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. This is //bhakti.//

So //tattva-jijñāsā.// Everyone should be inquisitive to inquire about the value of life, not like cats and dogs, no inquiry, simply... We go, walk, walking in the morning. We see so many nice bungalows---they are sleeping, as if the sleeping will save him. No. //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna// [//Hitopadeśa// 25], these four things, they are thinking that these four things will save him. No. Now you are situated in a very nice bungalow, very good income, very good wife and children. But any moment you can be kicked out of this situation, and you have to accept another body which is not very comfortable. This is nature's law. This is //tattva-jijñāsā.// If we simply foolishly think, "Now I am very secure," that is God, dog... [break] ...Vṛndāvana, They were ministers in the government of Nawab Hussain Shah. But when they lived in Vṛndāvana, about their life it is stated by Śrīnivāsa Ācārya, //nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau.// These things, //nidrā, āhāra, vihāra. Nidrā// means sleeping, //āhāra// means eating and //vihāra// means sense gratification. So //nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau,// conquered. Conquer. We have to conquer. This is called //jitendriya.//

So //tattva-jijñāsā.// This life is meant for //tattva-jijñāsā.// Not a single moment should be wasted if we actually want to save ourself. But we do not know what is saving. We do not know; even we do not understand the very first instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā: tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. A sane person should be inquisitive: "Now, I was a child; I got a baby's body. Now, from baby's body, youth's body. From youth's body, now I've got this old, old-age body. Then what is next? What is next?" This should be natural inquiry. And the answer is there in the //Bhagavad-gītā// in the beginning, //tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ:// "You'll have to accept another body." The //nāstika,// they say that "There is no..., no more life." Just like Professor Kotovsky, when I was in Moscow, he said, "Swāmījī, after the annihilation of the body, there is nothing. Everything finished." Just see. Now, Kṛṣṇa says that //na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. //Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācin na hanyate.// Now, shall I accept Professor Kotovsky's statement or Kṛṣṇa's statement? Which shall I accept?

Of course, according to our Vedic civilization, we have to accept the authority. All our //ācāryas,// those who are practically conducting the Vedic civilization or Hindu civilization---Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Śaṅkarācārya---everything, everyone says there is life. Śaṅkarācārya says, //bālās tāvat krīḍāsaktaḥ//[?]: "Oh, the boys..." He is going as a //sannyāsī,// passing through the street. He sees, //bālās tāvat krīḍāsaktaḥ:// "Oh, the boys are engaged in playing." //Bālās tāvat krīḍāsaktaḥ.// "And the young men, they are after young girls." //Bālās tāvat krīḍāsaktaḥ,// and //vṛddhāś tāvat cintā-magnāḥ, taruṇās tāvat taruṇī-raktāḥ//[?]. I am just forgetting the words. //Taruṇa// means young man. Young man, he is after some young girl, or young girl is after some young man. So childhood is being spoiled by playing, and youthhood is being spoiled by searching after the opposite sex, and old man, //vṛddhās tāvat cintā-magnāḥ,// and old man is thinking, "Now I could not do so, I could not situate this boy into right position. The girl is still unmarried. Now I am going to die." So many things, thoughts. //Parame brahmaṇi ko 'pi na lagnāḥ//[?]. "And nobody is interested with Para-brahman."

This is the world. He is thinking of so many things for others' benefit. He does not know his own benefit, that after death he is going to change his body. He has to accept another body. His chapter will begin a new history. "Now, what kind of body I am going to accept?" That he does not know. Therefore he is called //abodha-jāta,// fools. So therefore in his ignorance, whatever he is doing, //parābhava,// simply defeat. Simply defeat.

> parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto
> yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam
> [[books:sb:5:5:5|[SB 5.5.5]]]

> apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ
> gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām
> [[books:sb:2:1:2|[SB 2.1.2]]]

So we should be awakened to the consciousness, "Now what is my duty?" We should inquire. And for your inquiry, the answers are there already in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in the //Upaniṣads.// We have got in the //Purāṇas.// So we should utilize it. So instead of utilizing this knowledge, this treasure house of knowledge, we are reading bunch of useless newspaper. You see? In the Western countries, most of you may know, they are delivering in the morning such big lump of newspaper. And after one hour, it is thrown away. Who will read that? But people's attentions are diverted by so many nonsense literature, and they are not interested to inquire from the real source of knowledge, real treasure house of knowledge.

Therefore here it is said that //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā:// "Your only business is to inquire about the truth." And that truth should be inquired from whom? //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. If you are actually inquisitive to understand what is Absolute Truth, what is your life, what is the value of life, //tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta.// A //guru// is not a fashion, that "Oh, such-and-such //svāmījī// is a... Let me make him //guru.//" Just like, "Oh, there is a nice dog. Keep me a dog. Let me keep here dog." And if a //guru// says, "Yes, whatever you are doing, you are right. You can do whatever you... You can eat whatever you like. You can do whatever...," "Oh, he is a very nice //guru.//" And as soon as he will say, "No illicit sex life, sir; no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxication," "Oh, Swāmījī, you are very conservative." I have heard these things. That poet Allen Ginsberg, he said, "Swāmījī, you are very conservative." No. I am the most liberal. You do not know. If I become conservative, then none of you will come to me.

So a //brahmacārī// is strictly prohibited not to see even one young woman. But what can be done? In the Western countries, the boys and girls, they mix very freely. And if I say, "My dear boy, you cannot see even a young girl," then finished. My business there is finished. Therefore I have to arrange according to the country, according to the circumstances, as far as possible. So gradually, they are coming to the perfectional stage. So we have to adopt //deśa-kāla-pātra:// according to time, according to... But we are keeping our principles as it is, but making arrangement according to the circumstances. That is required.

So here, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.// Now what is //tattva?// Of course, I shall... It is... I can speak something about //tattva.// The next verse, it is //tattva. Tattva,// here it is said,

> vadanti tat tattva-vidas
> tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam
> brahmeti paramātmeti
> bhagavān iti śabdyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]

So //tattva,// the Absolute Truth, is one. Absolute Truth is not two. //Ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti.// Absolute Truth is one, but it is realized from different angles of vision. There are transcendentalist, just like... //Karmīs// are not transcendentalist. Fruitive worker: those who are simply working for betterment of life or standard of life or economic development---//dharma, artha, kāma. Kāma// means sense gratification. That is already explained. //Kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ.// But they are thinking that //indriya-prīti,// sense gratification, is the highest perfection of life. But //Bhāgavata// says, or our Vedic authority says, //kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ.// So //karmī,// they are rejected. They are not fit for spiritual life, at least, so long they remain //karmī, muḍḥa.// That I have explained last night. Then, out of many thousands of //karmīs,// one becomes //jñānī, jñānī,// in true knowledge. They are called //jñānī.// When one is fed up with this //karmī,// he comes to the stage of //jñānī,// knowledge, that "I am not this body. Why I am working so hard for this body like cats and dogs?" He comes to this platform of //jñānī.// Then above the //jñānī,// the //yogīs.// Those who are trying to connect, link with the Supreme, they are called //yogīs. Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ.// In the //yoga// stage, there is control of the senses. So //yogīs,// and then //bhaktas. Karmī, jñānī, yogī// and //bhakta. Bhakta// means devotee.

So those who are //karmīs,// they are not talked about here, //tattva,// because they are not interested in //tattva-jijñāsā.// They are interested in //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya. Viṣayī. Viṣayiṇām sandarśanam.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu, therefore, He was very strict //sannyāsī. Viṣayiṇāṁ sandarśanam atha yoṣitāṁ ca hā hanta hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato 'py asādhu// [[books:cc:madhya:11:8|[Cc. Madhya 11.8]]]. If you are interested... Caitanya Mahāprabhu was requested by His confidential devotees to allow a meeting with Mahārāja Pratāparudra. Oh, He immediately refused, "No, no. I cannot see a king." He was so strict. "A king is simply interested with politics and money, so what shall I do by meeting him? No, no. I cannot meet him." Refused. So in that connection He composed one //śloka,// verse, that //bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya// [[books:cc:madhya:11:8|[Cc. Madhya 11.8]]]: "Those who are interested to go to the other side of the spiritual world," //bhava-sāgarasya jigamiṣoḥ,// "that such person, for such person," //viṣayiṇāṁ sandarśanam atha yoṣitāṁ ca,// "to see the //viṣayīs// interested in simply eating, sleeping, mating, such person, and //yoṣit,// and woman," //hā hanta, hā hanta viṣa-bhakṣaṇato 'py asādhu,// "oh, for him, this kind of action is more abominable than drinking poison."

So actually, this is the position. If we are actually //tattva-jijñāsu,// then we must be very careful. Very careful. Especially in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said that //karmī-jñānī. Karmī// is also wanting, and //jñānī// is also wanting, and //yogī// is also wanting. //Karmī// wanting comfortable position of life. That is also want. And //jñānī,// he is also wanting //mokṣa,// to merge into the existence. Because after becoming big, big man within this material..., when he is frustrated, he wants to become God. That is another illusion. And how you can become God, sir? But the //jñānīs// they want, merge into the existence. //Sāyujya-mukti.// It is called //sāyujya-mukti,// to merge into the existence. That is Brahman. That is //brahma-jñāna.// And //yogīs,// they want some magic power, mystic power. They can walk on the water, they can fly in the air, and so many things---//aṇimā, laghimā, siddhi.// There are eight kinds of //siddhis: prākāmya, īśitā, vaśitā...// So a //yogī// can attain such perfection. But they are wants also. The //jñānīs// also want, and the //karmīs,// what to speak, they are simply in want. Therefore, //kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma ataeva śānta// [[books:cc:madhya:19:149|[Cc. Madhya 19.149]]]. A //kṛṣṇa-bhakta,// a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, he doesn't want anything more. He doesn't want anything more. You will never find that... Arjuna was a devotee. He was working for Kṛṣṇa so much; he was sacrificing everything. He was prepared to kill his family members and everything. Still, he never wanted anything, "Kṛṣṇa, give me this." Never. You will never find in the //Bhagavad-gītā.//

This is the position of //bhakta.// And that is the teaching of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]: "My dear Lord Jagadīśa, I don't want these things." What? //Na dhanam:// "I don't want riches." //Na dhanaṁ na janam:// "Not many followers." Because materially everyone wants this. He wants money, he wants to become leader, he will..., many thousands of people will follow him, //janam.// And //sundarīṁ kavitām,// very beautiful wife. These are the material wants. So Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He said, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye:// "I don't want all these things." This is called //niṣkāma. Kāma// means those who are wanting all these things. And //niṣkāma// means those..., one who does not want all these things. How one can avoid these? //Mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. If one becomes perfect, unalloyed devotee, he doesn't want all these things. Therefore he is //svāmī. Kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma ataeva śānta// [[books:cc:madhya:19:149|[Cc. Madhya 19.149]]]. Others, they are wanting something.

So we cannot be, I mean to..., peaceful so long we shall want something. That is the secret. And that want can be completely..., we can be free from all wants when we become Kṛṣṇa conscious.

> yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ

> duḥkhena na vicālyate

You have seen the history of Prahlāda Mahārāja, Dhruva Mahārāja, many, many devotees, Pāṇḍavas. How much tribulation they had to suffer in their life. So //yasmin sthite,// because they were devotee of Kṛṣṇa, they were never disturbed. Never. This is the position of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They will never want anything, and they are not disturbed by any material tribulations. This is the sign of a //kṛṣṇa-bhakta. Kṛṣṇa-bhakta niṣkāma ataeva śānta// [[books:cc:madhya:19:149|[Cc. Madhya 19.149]]].

So it is possible to arrive that state by little endeavor, and that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And it is so simple, by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// And the practical examples you can see, that these European, American boys, they had so many wants, but they..., all these demands could not satisfy them, but now they are fully satisfied simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Just like this boy, our Gurudāsa, explained that he could swim over liquor business. His father has got very big business of liquor. But no. He wants to swim in the ocean of transcendental love. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
