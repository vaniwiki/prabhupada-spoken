Mm-hm. And how many rounds you will chant?

**Ameyātmā:**
Sixteen.

**Prabhupāda:**

> satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido
> bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ
> [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]

When about Kṛṣṇa anything is discussed amongst the devotees, //satāṁ prasaṅgān,// at that time it becomes very pleasing to the ear and to the heart.

> satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido
> bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ
> [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]

That message becomes very pleasing to the ear and the heart. //Taj-joṣaṇād āśv apavarga-vartmani.// And if one practically applies in his life, then //śraddhā bhaktir ratir anukramiṣyati,// then he makes progress in spiritual life.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [//japa//]

**Karandhara:**

He was here earlier.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. So, what are the rules and regulation?

**Dharma-dakṣa:**
No meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxicants, no illicit sex life.

**Prabhupāda:**
So your spiritual name is Surānanda. //Sura,// this word, it, it becomes, //sura// means "liquor," and //sura// means "the demigods or the devotees." //Sura-asura. Asura// means demons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [aside] What is the...? Loka-dakṣa. Loka-dakṣa. Loka-dakṣa means Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram.// Nobody is proprietor of anything. This planet belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Not only this planet, other planets also. So Loka-dakṣa means Kṛṣṇa. Loka-dakṣa dāsa. All right.

Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, what are the rules and regulation?

**Rūpacandra:**
No intoxication, no illicit sex, no gambling and no meat-eating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, repetition of these four principles means you..., everyone should remember that you are promising before Kṛṣṇa. Just like there is affidavit in..., before the magistrate. If you break that, then you will be criminal. Similarly, whatever promise you are making before Kṛṣṇa, if you violate, it is a great sin, and you will be punished for that. So remember always. What is it?

//Jaya!// [//japa//]

**Hṛdayānanda:**
All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda! //Haribol!//
