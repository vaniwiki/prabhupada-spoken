====== Morning Walk, partially recorded ======

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...purport of the //Bhāgavata. Divā vyartha-karmabhiḥ. Karmabhiḥ. Divā ca vyartha-karmabhiḥ// [[books:sb:1:16:9|[SB 1.16.9]]]. [break] That's all.

**Karandhara:**
Oh, that... There is... Let's see, 1968, nineteen sixty..., 1970 there was a lot of rain. But I've never seen it rain four days in a row like this, just all day.

**Prabhupāda:**
All day and night.

**Karandhara:**
Yeah. I don't ever recall it raining so long in succession. Last year it didn't rain very much at all. Very little rain.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Last year all over the world there was drought. [break]

**Hanumān:**
...and they had some temples there in Rio de Janeiro and San Pablo, and they were followers of Gaurasundara and Siddha-svarūpa. And I think they're still there. And when I was there they were making //kīrtana,// and they were chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the middle of their //kīrtana,// they would stop their //kīrtana,// and they would chant "//Jaya jaya// Siddha-svarūpa," and "//Jaya jaya// Gaurasundara." So I could not do anything. I told them it was all wrong and everything, and, uh... But there is many, many innocent people who are following. They go there for the first time and they make them chant "//Jaya jaya// Siddha-svarūpa" and "//Jaya jaya// Gaurasundara," like this. So we were telling, we were talking with...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no harm in giving "//jaya//" to Vaiṣṇava, provided they follow the Vaiṣṇava principles. Otherwise, to glorify Vaiṣṇava is not bad. [pause] No, no "//jaya//" to Mahāprabhu, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they chant this?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Were they chanting "//Jaya// Lord Caitanya, Nityānanda Prabhu"?

**Hanumān:**
Yes, they also chanting "//Bhaja śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya.//" Yes. But the point is that they were chanting the name of Siddha-svarūpa Gosvāmī and Gaurasundara Gosvāmī, uh, Gaurasundara Adhikārī.

**Prabhupāda:**
If one is Vaiṣṇava, then to glorify him is..., that's not...

**Hanumān:**
So that's all right.

**Satsvarūpa:**
As long as that Vaiṣṇava is following the principles.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they should not attempt like that in the presence of their spiritual master. That is not good. When you found this?

**Satsvarūpa:**
When did you find they were doing this?

**Hanumān:**
When I was there. I was in Brazil about three months ago. And the only books they had published is a book written by Siddha-svarūpa Gosvāmī. They had published one book of him, and they were distributing this.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the name of that book?

**Hanumān:**
It was an introduction to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, question and answer.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have seen that book?

**Hanumān:**
Yes, Prabhupāda. I have give to Karandhara.

**Prabhupāda:**
So is there anything awkward against our devotional life?

**Karandhara:**
I can't read it. It's in Portuguese.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, it was in Portuguese language.

**Hanumān:**
Yes, it's in Portuguese. The only..., the only point is that he quotes in this book, he quotes more the books of Gaurasundara than your books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Hanumān:**
Gaurasundara have written some books, and so Siddha-svarūpa, answering the question, quotes from the book of Gaurasundara, and he mentioned, "My professor, Gaurasundara, taught me," and he quotes many, many time. Practically more from the book of Gaurasundara than from your books. [end]
