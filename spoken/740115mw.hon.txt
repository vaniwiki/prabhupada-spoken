====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...one poster.

**Satsvarūpa:**
...select [break] ...real leaders don't spoil life.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yeah, I saw the plan. It's nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Bali-mardana:**
I saw the plans for it; it's very nice. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Also clear water like this.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
Juhu beach is better than this.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yeah, this is rocky. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
There are two millions types of vegetables and trees and plants. Two million. What these rascals know? The botanists might have seen thousands, but two millions there are. [laughs] [//japa//] So they are getting bitter melon?

**Bali-mardana:**
They have got already.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's nice. Bitter melon, eggplant, maybe this //mankachu.// They prepare, they will be very nice combination. Yes. So buy one vegetable, you can eat whole thing. Yes.

**Sudāmā:**
We will try and get some squash leaves, too.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's nice.

**Sudāmā:**
I remember when we were here four years ago you had them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Sudāmā:**
The stems. [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...how's that, by the word.

**Prabhupāda:**
Salt, salt, turned into sand. Salty water, silica. Sodium silicate. Salt is called sodium carbonate?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, it is.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? [break] From any earth you'll find some percentage of salt. [break] ...for increasing population, but we rascals, we have made, "No, you cannot come here. You rot there." This is our civilization. India, China is overpopulated. So if people allow, just like Australia, Africa, and many islands.

**Bali-mardana:**
Russia.

**Prabhupāda:**
Russia is useless.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, it's too cold.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, it is for the Russians. But there are so many other islands like this.

**Sudāmā:**
Tahiti.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Sudāmā:**
Tahiti. Also is... Below here.

**Bali-mardana:**
There are thousands of islands in the Pacific.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. Let them come and live here. Produce foodstuffs, have cows, fruits, flowers, live peacefully, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa; but they won't allow. Americans, yes, they have got so much land. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam, tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. Whatever is Kṛṣṇa's property, you can... You are Kṛṣṇa's son; you can utilize it. But one son is prohibiting, "No, no, you cannot enter here." This is the problem. The so-called nationalism is dangerous. Just see how nice flowers, fruits, plant. Everything is there, complete.

> pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇam adaḥ
> pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate
> pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya
> pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate
> [[books:iso:0b|[Īśo Invocation]]]

There is no question of overpopulation at all. These rascals have created like that. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. They're coming from our temple?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes. Jayaśrī is here also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [//japa//] [aside:] Thank you. Jayaśrī joined when I first came here?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. Feeling all right? I think you joined when I first came here?

**Jayaśrī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. [japa] [break] //...savitā sakala-grahāṇām. Gāyatrī mantra// is worshiping the sun. //Yac cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ// [Bs. //5.52//], unlimitedly powerful, unlimitedly heated. //Aśeṣa.// How much heat is there, your brain cannot accommodate. And therefore it is said, //aśeṣa-tejāḥ:// "without any limit." This is God's creation. Where is the scientist who can create a small sun? How this water is going there? Where is the pipe? You rascal, if you want to pump your water in the skyscraper building, you require pumping and pipe and so many things. But where is the pipe? And where is the pumping station or pumping machine? But you'll find so much water. How the water is transferred there? What is their explanation? They'll use simply some bogus jugglery of words, that's all. But produce it, without pipe, without pump. Let the water go up, up. "Yes, we are trying. In future we shall do it." And what about of the present? Who is that scientist?

**Bali-mardana:**
They say it is an accident, that the world is going to the...

**Prabhupāda:**
They are rascals. Therefore I always say, "Kick them on their face with your shoes, so-called scientists." "Accident." There is no question of accident. //Mūḍha.// Therefore they have been described in the //Bhagavad-gītā// as //mūḍhā,// rascals, //narādhama. Narādhama,// the lowest of the mankind. Because they got this opportunity to appreciate the work of Kṛṣṇa, but they avoid it, they are //narādhama.// No, they are so big, big graduate, scientists, and..." //māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. Their real knowledge is taken away, simply childish proposing something, so-called scientists. Real knowledge is to see everywhere Kṛṣṇa, //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]], the supervision of Kṛṣṇa. That is real knowledge. Not only to appreciate, but to explain it also. //Kaniṣṭha-adhikārī// will appreciate, but cannot explain how it is being done. //Madhyama-adhikārī// will explain. That is preacher. And //uttama-adhikārī,// he thinks that everyone knows, everyone knows. He does not see that somebody knows, somebody does not know. He sees everyone knows. That is //uttama-adhikārī.// He does not make any distinction.

**Bali-mardana:**
He does not preach.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? No. He's //paramahaṁsa.// Does not preach [indistinct] he preaches, but he comes to the second-class platform. The first-class platform means he does not make any distinction between devotee and nondevotee. He sees everyone is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.

**Bali-mardana:**
Does he consciously come from the first class to the second class?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. Just like Jesus Christ said that there was many things to be said by, by...

**Bali-mardana:**
"There are many things, but I can..., but you cannot..., that I have to tell you, but you cannot bear them now."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, so that means he's first class, but he comes to the second-class platform or third-class platform to teach the third class, second class. He's first class. Son of God cannot be second class or third class. He must be first class. But... Just like Lord Buddha. He's God himself, but he said nothing about God because he knew that "These rascals, they will not be able to... Let them stop meat-eating, that's all. Let them become sinless first of all; then they will be able..." So his main preaching was //ahiṁsā,// nonviolence, no meat-eating. But still, they violate that. Jesus Christ also preached, "Thou shall not kill," but these rascals, all violating. And still, they are proclaiming as Christian and Buddhist. No religion will, real religion, will allow this kind of violence. No religion. It is cheating religion. //Dharmaḥ kaitavaḥ.// Any religion committing unnecessary violence to the animals, it is third class. It is not religion; it is cheating. Simply cheating.

**Sudāmā:**
They believe it's very necessary.

**Prabhupāda:**
They believe because they're rascals. Why necessary? We are not meat-eaters. Why it is necessary? You have created necessary. Tongue. //Tār madhye jihvā ati lobhamoy sudurmati:// "The tongue is very greedy, and it does not satisfy." Therefore they create their necessity. Civilized human, how they can eat meat? It is meant for the cats, dogs, tigers, not for human beings. So they're not human beings even. Actually they're animals. What religion animals may have? [break] ...Kṛṣṇa's craftsmanship, from one seed, a small, such a big tree has come, and within that seed there are the potency of demonstrating how variegatedness, nicely, within that seed. You produce such things. Make by chemical composition something and sow it and a tree will come out like this.

**Bali-mardana:**
We will have it next year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bali-mardana:**
Next year we will have it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Next year?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, we are working on it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is working?

**Bali-mardana:**
The scientists always say, "Next year, next year."

**Prabhupāda:**
Next year. Then before next year coming, he will be finished.

**Sudāmā:**
They're producing large trees out of plastic.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Sudāmā:**
They make..., they can make a whole at... Just like this island, they can make out of plastic. Plastic coconut trees...

**Prabhupāda:**
How many they can make?

**Devotee:**
Not very many.

**Bali-mardana:**
They do not reproduce.

**Sudāmā:**
They don't reproduce, though.

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply they're rascals, and who are bewildered by rascals, they are also rascals. //Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:19|[SB 2.3.19]]]. He's an animal, and their work is appreciated by another animal. The so-called scientists' advancement of knowledge is appreciated by another rascal, not any intelligent man. We can appreciate, but when they're godless, we kick him out. Just see. This is the... Now, this is a solid thing. How it grows and how the water comes? Now it will not grow, because detached. But if it remains attached, it will grow. So wherefrom the water is coming?

**Bali-mardana:**
From the ground.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you'll find that it is well protected cell, and you find two pieces of //cāpāṭi// and one glass of water, ready. No need of cooking. Yes. You simply take. Take the water and take the pulp and eat pulp and the glass of water. That's all. Your meal is finished; luncheon is finished. You don't require.

**Sudāmā:**
The atheist class of men, they are thinking, "Well, we are watering. We are giving the water with the hose. We are giving water in the tree, just like this man is cutting the lawn. So we are maintaining it." They are not thinking that Kṛṣṇa is giving the water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then wherefrom water got? You rascal, wherefrom you got the water?

**Sudāmā:**
They say, "It's too much to think about."

**Prabhupāda:**
That means rascal. That means rascal. Yes. [//japa//] [break] ...plastic group like this? Their life will be finished. [break]

**Devotee:**
...in //Time// magazine yesterday, and the scientists are thinking now that man is his mind. They were talking about the brain.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
That if man only knew his mind he would know himself. What is actually the brain? And the mind?

**Prabhupāda:**
Mind, that is also matter, material.

**Devotee:**
They're saying that the mind or the brain is the source of man's consciousness.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Brain is the instrument for expressing consciousness. Otherwise, when the man is dead, why the brain does not work? Do you follow?

**Devotee:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why the brain work stops?

**Devotee:**
The soul leaves the body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Its known body is also material. Spirit soul, so long there is within the body, it works. You cut this tree and it will dry, it will not work. So long the soul is there, it is very luxuriant, very beautiful. [//japa//] [break] ...[indistinct] No.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Decorations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Decoration?

**Satsvarūpa:**
These white pillars?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...and papaya is very good for breakfast. [break] ...better than Los Angeles.

**Bali-mardana:**
Oh, yes.

**Sudāmā:**
You like it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Actually, Hawaii is supposed to be the center of... It's right between the East and the West, between Japan and USA and Australia.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, marginal.

**Bali-mardana:**
It is a good headquarters for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
For USA, 'cause then... It is very easy to come from the mainland.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So make a headquarter.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes.

**Sudāmā:**
We can make... We'll make a nice house for you on the land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Very nice. [//japa//] [break]

**Sudāmā:**
Where?

**Prabhupāda:**
Here?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes, they're cows, but they keep them very poorly, treat them very badly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why? You keep cows nicely.

**Sudāmā:**
Yes, we can do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Jayaśrī:**
On Kauai they have //tulasī// plants and they have a cow.

**Sudāmā:**
There's some devotees on another island, and they have //tulasī// plants and a cow there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. [break]

**Nitāi:**
Morning Walk... [break] [end]
