**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he desires.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. And he is not motivated.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Gurudāsa:**
He is very good, good. Kapoor also is increasing more and more, very much favorable. Sat Bisanchand also is favorable. Is nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Influential man he is?

**Gurudāsa:**
Somewhat influential, but... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that, but now from Rādhā-Dāmodara Temple he cannot take anything.

**Gurudāsa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
So how he will maintain?

**Gurudāsa:**
I don't know. He must have some money.

**Prabhupāda:**
And what Panchu is doing?

**Gurudāsa:**
Panchu I have not seen, because I have been here mostly, on the construction site. I don't go so much.

**Prabhupāda:**
How he has left for some service.

**Gurudāsa:**
Maybe. I can inquire.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. There is no... Why you should go? Let them do their own work.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Devotee:**
I can sweep over here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Yes. Why not?

**Gurudāsa:**
Next month is again rental, rent time. I paid him six months in advance previously. So it would go to February. Because I knew that the śevaite was changing, so I wanted to do like that. Next month is again, March 1st, payment...

**Prabhupāda:**
But whenever you give money, you must take receipt in this printed.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. Printed receipt.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Printed form.

**Gurudāsa:**
So I should again pay to Gaurachand Gosvāmī? I think so.

**Prabhupāda:**
This, this, this [indistinct] complete.

**Gurudāsa:**
But that..., that will be complete soon. Saurabha says it will be complete soon.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Next time I, when I come...

**Devotee:**
Come, it, roof should be ready.

**Prabhupāda:**
...I want to see that it is, roof is complete, and then we begin. So another thing: should I take rates for the marble from others, or we shall accept this?

**Gurudāsa:**
I've already taken rates, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Gurudāsa:**
And now this man, Narayan Das, says that yesterday they said that it did..., the rates did not include people to put the marble in. It did not include laborers to install.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. They have..., they have to order this, because [indistinct] include everything.

**Gurudāsa:**
If it includes, it is a good rate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Gurudāsa:**
But in, in Makrana I got the rate seven-fifty, eight rupees. Seven, seven-fifty, eight for //dungri,// that kind. And about two-fifty to three extra for labor. So if they charge eight or seven, including labor and delivery and polishing, it is good rate, but if it is just delivery, it is not a good rate.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, Mr. [indistinct] said that he'll send the contract form. So we have to see.

**Gurudāsa:**
If it does not include the delivery and the polishing...

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] must include delivery, polishing, everything.

**Gurudāsa:**
If it does, it's good rate. Also this black marble, I've gotten the price in Makrana four, four rupees and fifty paisa.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is excluding labor.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. So if they can do it for five, it is good rate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
But if they do it five for just the marble, it is not good rate.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. That is not good. It is included everything. That I was informed by...

**Gurudāsa:**
Then it's..., then it is good. It is very good for us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then we shall accept.

**Gurudāsa:**
Oh, yes. It is good quotation. But he is not willing to do the bank guarantee.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurudāsa:**
The pound, the //huṇḍa,// what is it called?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Huṇḍi.//

**Gurudāsa:**
//Huṇḍi.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That we shall... He is not bringing all the goods at a time.

**Gurudāsa:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
Partially. We have to pay.

**Gurudāsa:**
All right. [break] Śrīla Prabhupāda, I want you to feel that we will do this, and this work, and spend frugally and thrifty.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very frugally. You have already become very unfrugal.

**Gurudāsa:**
I am agitated that you are anxious about it, because yes, I commit many mistakes, no doubt.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, that's all right. Don't commit more, that's all.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. But there's also some mistakes I have not committed. There's some very good things that have happened.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Don't commit mistake.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Devotee should not commit mistake. He's above it.

**Gurudāsa:**
But I want you to feel...

**Prabhupāda:**
No. It is my business to worry.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, yes. You are the best father I have. My father spared the rod. He spoiled me.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
And you are not doing.

**Prabhupāda:**
But don't take, because I do not show the stick, don't take advantage of it.

**Gurudāsa:**
You have shown the stick, verbally.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now do it nicely. Keep me less anxiety.

**Gurudāsa:**
I want to do.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is natural when money is misspent, one who brings money he thinks this.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
I take so much trouble, and then... That is, that is always [indistinct].

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. I also would feel that way.

**Prabhupāda:**
So the money raised for the other business, that should be spent for that purpose.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And the temple money... So you'll go to the bank tomorrow? Yes?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which bank he has dispatched the 50,000?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, Syndicate.

**Prabhupāda:**
But they have not yet informed. How is that? He said he has already sent.

**Gurudāsa:**
He has telegrammed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Gurudāsa:**
Girirāja has telegrammed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah.

**Gurudāsa:**
But the bank has not informed. Guṇārṇava is checking today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Telegrammed the money?

**Gurudāsa:**
Girirāja has telegrammed myself, directly...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Gurudāsa:**
....that he has sent it.

**Prabhupāda:**
When he has sent it?

**Gurudāsa:**
Telegrammed yesterday..., day before yesterday, evening.

**Prabhupāda:**
Day before yesterday.

**Gurudāsa:**
Evening.

**Prabhupāda:**
Evening.

**Gurudāsa:**
Late evening.

**Prabhupāda:**
So they must have received the money by today.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. Guṇārṇava is checking. [end]
