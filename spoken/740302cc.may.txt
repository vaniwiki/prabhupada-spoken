====== Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā 7.2 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [Prabhupāda and devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> jaya jaya mahāprabhu śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya
> tāṅhāra caraṇāśrita sei baḍa dhanya
> [[books:cc:adi:7:2|[Cc. Ādi 7.2]]]

[break] [02:22]

Translation: "Let me offer glorification to the Supreme Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One who has taken shelter of His lotus feet is the most glorified person."

**Prabhupāda:**

> jaya jaya mahāprabhu śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya
> tāṅhāra caraṇāśrita sei baḍa dhanya
> [[books:cc:adi:7:2|[Cc. Ādi 7.2]]]

Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī dictated this verse:

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne...
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]

He's Kṛṣṇa Himself. In this Kali-yuga, Kṛṣṇa's direct identification, incarnation, is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is also confirmed in all the Vedic literature---//Mahābhārata, Purāṇa, Upaniṣad//---and the essence of all Vedic literature is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// There is also Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He's accepted as the Supreme Lord.

> kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ
> sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
> yajñair saṅkīrtana-prāyair
> yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ
> [SB 11.5.32]

This is mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// that in the Kali-yuga the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa is, by His bodily complexion, //akṛṣṇa. Akṛṣṇa// means "not //kṛṣṇa.//" The "not //kṛṣṇa//" means there are many other colors. So in the //śāstra// it is said that Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, appears in the four //yugas// in four different colors: //śukla raktas tathā pīta idānīṁ kṛṣṇataṁ gataḥ// [[books:sb:10:8:13|[SB 10.8.13]]].

When Kṛṣṇa was born, Gargamuni, the family priest... It is the system among the Vedic culturalists that as soon as a child is born, immediately his horoscope is made and his past, future is calculated. //Janma-jñasthi//[?]. So that function, on account of poverty and many other causes, nobody practically practices. But this is also one of the //saṁskāra.// Before birth there is //saṁskāra, garbhādhāna saṁskāra.// While the child is within the womb, there is //saṁskāra.// In this way, a human body is purified by different kinds of //saṁskāras,// or purificatory methods. //Daśabhidasaṁskāra. Saṁskārād bhaved dvija. Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ.// If in... Anyone is born by father and mother... Even cats and dogs, they have got father and mother. Any life you get, there is father and mother. Therefore in the //Prema-vivarta// there is a //śloka://

> janame janame sabe pitā-mātā pāya
> kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

In any birth, you'll get father, mother. That is not a very difficult thing. Without father and mother there is no birth. So to get father and mother is usual; it is not very difficult. But, //kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei:// in every birth, you cannot get Kṛṣṇa or you cannot get bona fide spiritual master. //Kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei. Guru-kṛṣṇa kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. These are the statements of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Those who have read //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// they know it. So, perfection of human life is possible by the mercy of //guru// and Kṛṣṇa. And that mercy can be achieved in the human form of life, not in the life of cats and dogs. Therefore it is said, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is acting both as //guru// and Kṛṣṇa---combination of //guru// and Kṛṣṇa.

So, Kavirāja Gosvāmī, the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// he first offered his obeisances to Lord Caitanya in the first verse, //agaty-eka-gatiṁ natvā// [[books:cc:adi:7:1|[Cc. Ādi 7.1]]]. After offering obeisances to the Supreme Lord, who is the only hope for the hopeless, now he's again offering, //jaya jaya mahāprabhu śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya. Prabhu// and //mahāprabhu.// Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu---any Vaiṣṇava is addressed as //prabhu//---but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is //mahāprabhu,// the topmost //prabhu,// the master //prabhu.// All others are servant //prabhu.// Just like, it is very easy to understand: if you are working in an office, your immediate boss, you consider him as your master, but he's not the master. The master of the office is the managing director, manager of the proprietor. But still, those who are working under him, sub-//prabhus,// they are also called //prabhu.// So all Vaiṣṇava should be addressed as //prabhu;// that is the etiquette. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is //mahāprabhu.// As soon as you utter the name of Śrī Caitanya, the //mahāprabhu...// Because He's the greatest master. That will be explained in the few next verse,

> ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa āra saba bhṛtya
> yāre yaiche nācāya, se taiche kare nṛtya
> [[books:cc:adi:5:142|[Cc. Ādi 5.142]]]

We are simply dancing in this material world. We are trying to be master of the material world. Everyone is trying. Everyone wants to exploit the resources of the material nature. He wants to become master. That is the struggle for existence. I am trying to become master, you are trying to become master, so there is clash, there is collision. I am challenging you, "Why you should become master?" He's challenging why I should be master. This is going on. This is material world. But if we accept Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, if we accept this principle that none of us is a //prabhu,// everyone is a servant... //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. If we accept this principle, that we are eternal servant, we are not master---master is Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu---then our problems are solved.

Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, he has sung a song, //jīv kṛṣṇa dāsa ei viśvās korle to ār duḥkha nāi.// This is the solution. Everyone is thinking to become the master, //prabhu. Prabhu// you can become. That is not, I mean to say, extraordinary. Some way or other we are //prabhus.// Suppose I am a family man; I am managing my family, my wife, my children, my servants, my subordinates, so I may be //prabhu.// In that sense I am a small //prabhu.// Similarly, everyone is //prabhu,// he has got some subordinates. But there is the supreme //prabhu,// the //prabhu// of all //prabhus.// So //mahāprabhu// is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. He's Kṛṣṇa. As it is stated in the //Brahma-saṁhitā: īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Īśvara// means ruler or controller. So all of us more or less a little controller or ruler, but not the absolute ruler. The absolute ruler is Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, the absolute //prabhu,// master, is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

So, //tāṅhāra caraṇāśrita:// The //prabhu...// Everyone is //prabhu//---that's all right---but if that //prabhu// takes shelter of the lotus feet of the //mahāprabhu, sei baḍa dhanya,// he becomes glorified. Not to remain satisfied becoming a //prabhu// of your wife, children, family, country, or this or that, but you should try to become the servant of Mahāprabhu. //Tāṅhāra caraṇāśrita// [[books:cc:adi:7:2|[Cc. Ādi 7.2]]]. He's glorified because he receives... To become under the lotus feet of Śrī. If you take shelter of the supreme //prabhu,// Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then your life is successful. //Sei baḍa dhanya.// He is glorified. To become servant of God or Mahāprabhu is very prestigious. It is not very easy thing to become servant of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu or servant of Kṛṣṇa. So if anyone agrees to become the servant of the supreme //prabhu,// master, then his life is successful. //Sei baḍa dhanya.// He is glorified.

The Vaiṣṇava, their principle is to become..., to come to the platform of eternal servitude. That is the philosophy of Vaiṣṇava philosophy: not to become the master but to become servant of the master. This is perfect philosophy. //Gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. So long in the material conception of life we... The //brāhmaṇa// is thinking the master of the //kṣatriya// or the //vaiśya// or the //śūdra;// a //sannyāsī// is thinking the master of //vānaprastha, gṛhastha, brahmacārī.// Similarly, in //gṛhastha// also, the chief man in the household life, he is thinking master. So everyone, //kṣatriya// king, he's thinking he's master. So, you are master to some extent, but if you accept Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu or Śrī Kṛṣṇa as your master, then your life is successful. This is the secret of success.

That is confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā
> varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ
> svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya
> saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam
> [[books:sb:1:2:13|[SB 1.2.13]]]

Just like Arjuna was fighting, //kṣatriya.// His business was to fight. Why he was fighting the Battle of Kurukṣetra? To become master of the kingdom. But he remained eternally servant of Kṛṣṇa. This is success. Don't be satisfied simply I become master of your material position. At the same time, you try to become the servant of the Supreme; then you are successful. Relative. Our mastership is relative. Under certain condition we become master, but Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is master without any condition. //Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa prema pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. Because He's master, He can distribute //kṛṣṇa prema// very easily. Otherwise, //kṛṣṇa prema...// Not only //kṛṣṇa prema;// one cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa.

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yayati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

Out of many millions of persons, one may try to make his life successful, and out of many such person who has become successful, to understand the constitutional position of his life, one may understand---one //may// understand; there is no surety---Kṛṣṇa.

So to understand Kṛṣṇa is very, very difficult job.

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

To understand Kṛṣṇa and to understand the service of Kṛṣṇa is very exalted post. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ.// One has to become //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// completely liberated. Then he can understand how to render service to Kṛṣṇa, //mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām.// So, so difficult subject matter is given very easily by Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore Rūpa Gosvāmī offered his first prayer to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]

Such a difficult subject matter: Kṛṣṇa. "You are not only giving Kṛṣṇa, but You are giving //kṛṣṇa-prema,// love of Kṛṣṇa." You can meet somebody, some exalted person, you can see, but to become an intimate relationship with such exalted person in love, that is not very easy thing. I can meet the president or some exalted person, but to become in love with him in intimacy, that is not easy job. But Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu distributed this Kṛṣṇa love immediately, anyone. That is Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu's, I mean to say, contribution to the human society. If you simply become under the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then love of Kṛṣṇa is very easily achieved.

Therefore it is said: //tāṅhāra caraṇāśrita, sei baḍa dhanya.// He's glorified because he receives... To become under the lotus feet of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu means you have got Kṛṣṇa. You have already got. That is the verdict of the //śāstra// and //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Because Kṛṣṇa, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, does not give anything else. Simply directly gives you Kṛṣṇa and His love. And to award this greatest benediction to the human society, He took //sannyāsa// at the age of twenty-four years only, in this land of Māyāpur, Navadvīpa. It is very glorified place. It is not ordinary place. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //gauḍa maṇḍala bhūmi, yeba jane cintāmaṇi tara hoy vrajabhūme vāsa.// Anyone who understands //gauḍa maṇḍala bhūmi// in Bengal---this Navadvīpa, Navadvīpa-candra, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu---if anyone understands the spiritual value of this land, he lives in Vrajabhūmi, in Vṛndāvana. There is no difference between Vṛndāvana and this Gaura-maṇḍala-bhūmi. That is the verdict of the //śāstra. Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi yena jane cintāmaṇi tara hoy vrajabhūme vāsa// [Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura].

So read Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's //Prārthanā,// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's //Prārthanā.// They are very, very valuable for advancement of spiritual understanding, especially Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's //Prārthanā.// So, by reading them, by understanding them, we can understand Kṛṣṇa very easily. Otherwise, it is very, very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa. Big, big scholars, big, big //sannyāsīs,// they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. They understand Kṛṣṇa that Kṛṣṇa is like us---a very great man, politician, historical person---or sometimes thinks of Kṛṣṇa as a debauch because He was in association with the //gopīs// or He married sixteen thousand wives.

So we shall be misled to understand Kṛṣṇa if we try to do so by our own knowledge. We have to accept Kṛṣṇa through Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu advises everyone:

> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa
> yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself. //Kṛṣṇa-upadeśa. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum...// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. Because He came as a human being, people have misunderstood Him, that He's a human being. He's not human being. He's the master of the human being. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. Kṛṣṇa comes, very kindly---because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa---when we are in distressed condition on account of violating the laws of religion. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati. Glāni// means deviation from the path of religion. And what is religion? Religion: //dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. Religion means the laws of God. That is religion. Simple definition. Laws, the words, the rules and regulation given by the Lord, that is called religion. Just like I have several times explained, the laws, the rules and regulations given by the state is called law. You cannot manufacture law. Similarly, you cannot manufacture //dharma.// Nowadays, in this Kali-yuga, all the rascals, they are manufacturing religion. But who cares for that religion, or what will be the benefit of such religion? There'll be no benefit. It is simply...

[break] ...that "I am Kṛṣṇa." Never said. Rather, when He was in Vṛndāvana, some of the devotees eulogized Him that "You are Kṛṣṇa," He immediately blocked His ear: "No, no. Don't say like that." That is the indication that to claim to become God or Kṛṣṇa is the highest type of rascaldom. That is rascaldom. Those who are these Māyāvādīs who are claiming that "Everyone is God. I am God, you are God," they are all rascals. Therefore I have said in connection, with reference to that boy-god..., you know, I do not wish to repeat. We do not accept such cheap God. No. We accept Kṛṣṇa. And we accept Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as God because //śāstra// says, the //ācārya// says; therefore we follow the footsteps of the //ācāryas.// Rūpa Gosvāmī says, //kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne:// "Sir, You have now come... You are Kṛṣṇa. You have come under the name of Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. You are so magnanimous that You are distributing..." Be... Without becoming Kṛṣṇa, how one can distribute Kṛṣṇa? Without one becoming millionaires, how he can distribute millions of dollars?

So it is the business of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu... He's so magnanimous that He is distributing Kṛṣṇa. So take shelter of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu. You have come from distant place, you have spent much money, thousands of money to come here. Take advantage of this journey and chant //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.// Then you'll get Kṛṣṇa. Then you'll get, surely. This land, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's birth site. So anyone who takes shelter of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he is //dhanya,// he is glorified.

Thank you very much.
