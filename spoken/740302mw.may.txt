====== Morning Walk, [partially recorded] ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...recognized as "American temple." What is this Maṭha? Śrī Caitanya...

**Bhavānanda:**
Caitanya Mahārāja?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, about this one.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda asked about this Maṭha.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who, who is he?

**Bhavānanda:**
He's a renegade //brahmacārī// from one of your Godbrothers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Prabhupāda dāsa. [break]

**Gargamuni:**
He seems to be helped by Mādhava Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Gargamuni:**
He's the one that purchased the land on the north side of us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So tomorrow we will go in the morning?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You time fix up. I am ready.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [break] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...when I don't remain, "Get out." This is Māyāvāda philosophy. "So long I require your help, I catch your hand. And as soon as I don't require, 'Please get out.' "

[break]

**Gargamuni:**
We have Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He..., he was worshiping Viṣṇu at home, and he was trying to kill Kṛṣṇa. [chuckles] Similarly, there are many Vaiṣṇavas like Jarāsandha---apparently worshiping Viṣṇu, but trying to kill Kṛṣṇa. Jarāsandha-Vaiṣṇava.

**Jayapatākā:**
So what is the value of such worship of Viṣṇu?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayapatākā:**
So what is the benefit of such worship of Viṣṇu, Jarāsandha worship?

**Prabhupāda:**
They will get material opulence. //Asuras,// they want material opulence. They, they do not understand what is spiritual life or spiritual happiness, what is devotional service. Neither they'd like to understand. Which way?

**Jayapatākā:**
Left here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...we heard from...?

**Gurukṛpā:**
It's from the Ganges?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurukṛpā:**
From the Ganges?

**Jayapatākā:**
[to other devotees] What is this [indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
"...near the //brahma-jyotir,// I don't want. Now I have merged." This is Māyāvāda theory.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is all that silt from the Ganges River, Prabhupāda.

**Jayapatākā:**
This man, he wants to sell this land, seventeen //bighās,// for seven hundred rupees. [break]

**Madhudviṣa:**
How is that possible?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Madhudviṣa:**
How is the Ganges flowing through the planetary systems?

**Prabhupāda:**
So? It is not possible?

**Madhudviṣa:**
I don't know. It is possible, but it is incomprehensible.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything is incomprehensible. How the planets are floating in this air?

**Madhudviṣa:**
Because Kṛṣṇa is in them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then similarly, Kṛṣṇa desires, everything is possible.

**Jayapatākā:**
Madhudviṣa Mahārāja has given us his T-shirt.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayapatākā:**
He has given us nice shirt, Gaura-Nitāi.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Let us go... [break] ...is a great opportunity, this taking bath along with the Vaiṣṇavas in the Ganges at Navadvīpa. [chuckles]

**Jayapatākā:**
By your mercy, you have given us such a great opportunity, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is all respectively. You are all Vaiṣṇavas. To take bath along with you is a great opportunity.

**Gurukṛpā:**
A great opportunity to be purified. [break]

**Bhavānanda:**
...spiritual master. Then when he reaches a certain point, he lets go. What is...? What becomes of him? He is also Māyāvādī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is Māyāvādī philosophy. [break] ...philosophy, //cakhudāna dilo yei janme janme pita sei.// Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings that "One who has opened my eyes, my spiritual master, he's my father, life after life." So how he can..., he can say, "Go away now"? That is Māyāvāda philosophy. [end]
