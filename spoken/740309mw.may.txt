====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
He's situated as Paramātmā, //antaryāmī,// everywhere. //Aṇḍāntara-stham:// within the universe as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, within the heart of everyone, and even within the atom. Then how we can walk? Kṛṣṇa is within the atom. How we can walk? If somebody says, "How we are walking on the road?" Because within the atom there is God. Within... //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35].

**Indian man (1):**
In everywhere...

**Prabhupāda:**
So this, this is combination of //paramāṇu,// atom. So how we can walk? People may question like that, that "In, within the //paramāṇu// there is Kṛṣṇa. How we are walking on this road?" So this question you should all understand very... You know that upon the //mandira,// we do not stay. Just like our Vṛndāvana //mandira// is being constructed. There is no residential quarter upon the //mandira.// Similarly, when the //mandira// will be constructed, we are not so fool that we'll show..., we'll go and stay upon the //mandira.// But //mandira// is not constructed yet. So what shall we do?

**Indian man (1):**
Worship should go on.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Therefore we have temporary situated //mandira// in the same building. We cannot stop our worship. That is not possible. Because one cannot go upon the //mandira,// because the Lord is now being worshiped within the residence, it does not mean we can stop His worship. Worship must continue in any condition, //apratihatā,// without being impeded by any rules and regulation. This is called //rāga-mārga. Vidhi-mārga,// and there is //rāga-mārga. Vidhi-mārga// means under rules and regulation, and //rāga-mārga// means out of love. That is another thing. There is another instance. Govinda was personal servant of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So after His dinner, Govinda used to give Him massage on the leg. So one day Caitanya Mahāprabhu fell down on the ground and began to sleep on the door. So Govinda was to give massage to His leg, so he crossed Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and began to...

**Indian man (1):**
Walk.

**Devotee:**
Massage. Massage His legs.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not walk. Giving massage. So He was sleeping. So at two or three o'clock when Śrī Caitanya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became awake: "Govinda, you are sitting here. You have not taken your dinner?" "No, sir." "Why?" "Now, how could I cross you and take my dinner?" "Then how you came?" "No, that is for Your massaging. [laughter] But I cannot cross You for my dinner."

**Indian man (1):**
Yes. "For You I can cross."

**Prabhupāda:**
"For You, I can do anything."

**Indian man (1):**
"For You..."

**Prabhupāda:**
"For Your service."

**Indian man (1):**
"For Your service."

**Prabhupāda:**
"But for my sense gratification, I cannot do that."

**Indian man (1):**
Very good answer.

**Prabhupāda:**
In a... In the Western countries I had to sometimes do something which I should not have done. But I've done it to bring so many souls to Kṛṣṇa.

**Brahmānanda:**
The preaching necessitates that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because if there is no other alternative, what can I do? In the beginning I had no disciples. So I was cooking myself. So one gentleman, he... Later on, he became my disciple. He gave me some place. I was cooking. And in the refrigerator, I saw there was meat. [laughs] So I asked: "What is this?" He said, "It is for cats. I don't take meat." "All right. [laughter] I'll do." So of course, I stayed there for three, four days. And if I cry, "Oh, I have violated my rules and regulation..." Rules and regulation can be violated when there is urgent necessity of service, not whimsically or for one's sense gratification. And that is, of course, in our present..., with the permission of the spiritual master, not one should think, "Oh, I have become so much great devotee, I can violate all the rules and..." No, you cannot. If there is need of violating rules and regulation, you must take permission. Now we have no temple. Under the circumstances, we are doing that. So you construct the temple as soon as possible so that people may not criticize you.

[break] ...for all //gṛhastha// devotees, you should begin preaching amongst the //gṛhasthas.// It is not forbidden for the //gṛhasthas// to preach, because preaching is required everywhere. Arjuna was //gṛhastha.// So //yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]. One must know the science of Kṛṣṇa. Then you can become preacher.

> kibā vipra kibā śūdra nyāsī kene naya
> yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]

> āmāra ājñāya guru tāra ei deśa
> yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

This is preaching. It doesn't matter whether one is //sannyāsī// or //gṛhastha,// or a //brāhmaṇa// or a //śūdra.// It doesn't matter. If one knows the science of Kṛṣṇa then he can become //guru.// And He said, "By My order, you become //guru// and deliver your country." //Ei deśa. Ei deśa// means "your country." "So what is to be done?" "Now, just whomever you meet, you instruct him about the instruction given by Kṛṣṇa." [break] ...seeing that "Why our..., you are living on the top of the temple?" You inform them that "You have not seen yet temple. It is not temple."

**Indian man (1):**
It is temporary...

**Prabhupāda:**
You have yet to see what is temple. "Temple will be constructed. This is not temple." I wanted to stay in the //dharmaśālā// of Tīrtha Mahārāja, to construct the temple. I requested him that "Some of my men will stay in the //dharmaśālā.//" He refused. Then how can I construct temple? Therefore I have first constructed residential quarter. And unless my men live here, how can I construct temple? So this is residential quarter. This is not the temple. The temple has yet to be done. So suppose we have no regularly constructed temple. Do you think we shall give up worship of the Lord?

**Indian man (1):**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then?

**Indian man (1):**
We must continue it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. Because there is no temple... Bhavānanda, un, understanding?

**Bhavānanda:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (1):**
We can do our worship any else.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And it is said...

**Indian man (1):**
Any else, in the jungle, anywhere else.

**Prabhupāda:**
//...bhakti. Bhakti,// the definition of //bhakti// is given in the //Bhāgavata, apratihatā. Pratihata// means impediment. I have seen amongst the Muhammadans---it is very good---as soon as their //namaz// time is there, anywhere they will...

**Indian man (2):**
Anywhere, anywhere, they will.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is very good.

**Indian man (2):**
Even on road, they will...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (2):**
On the boat, on the everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere.

**Indian man (2):**
The four times, three times, //namaz.//

**Prabhupāda:**
They're so regulated, as soon as the time is there, anywhere they'll worship.

**Indian man (1):**
There was big trouble about them...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Indian man (1):**
There was big trouble about them in London for some time.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Indian man (1):**
Because they would leave their work and start praying.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Indian man (1):**
Then the work was stopped, and later on, it was sorted out. They were allowed to do their worship. [break]

**Indian man (2):**
...cultured under, say, very comfortable circumstances. This has a relation to constant inquiries from public, specially young men, at the entrance of our //mandira,// our, this building, these days. I was sort of doing, helping them for entrance and exit. In that course, many young people specially, they asked, "How could people living in so much comfortable circumstances could hear and ask for //bhakti?//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Then does it mean that those who are...?

**Indian man (2):**
I knew... Yes... Yes...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Those who are in uncomfortable situation, they are big //bhaktas?// [laughter] Can you show me that because they're in uncomfortable situation, they have become big //bhakta?// Is that the proof? What is this land?

**Bhavānanda:**
This land we were looking at a few days ago? You suggested purchasing it for grazing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is very nice. So it is possible?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, so do it. [break] //...bhakti's,// as I explained, //apratihatā.// Any condition, //bhakti// can be executed. The example is given: Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda Rāya. Rāmānanda Rāya was //gṛhastha// and governor, and he was very comfortably situated. And Rūpa Gosvāmī was living underneath a tree every night. And both of them were equally... Rather, Rāmānanda Rāya was accepted in greater position than Rūpa Gosvāmī. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was in renounced order of life, but He gave even better position to Rāmānanda Rāya than Rūpa Gosvāmī. And Rāmānanda Rāya was a //gṛhastha.// He was not even a //brāhmaṇa.// And governor, very opulent. Very comfortable situation. You know this?

**Indian man (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So how Caitanya Mahāprabhu treat them equally or gave better position to Rāmānanda Rāya than Rūpa Gosvāmī? This question was raised not only now---when our Guru Mahārāja started Gauḍīya Maṭha. So he was allowing the //sannyāsīs// to live in palatial building and go in car for preaching work. So many such person questioned, "How is that, //sannyāsīs// are going in car, living in palatial building?" So our Guru Mahārāja replied that "A devotee should be offered the best comfort of life." And if he would not have introduced this comfortable life, at the same time, to become pure devotee, then these devotees from Western countries will..., would never come. They would never agree to sit down under the tree and imitating Rūpa Gosvāmī. That is not possible. Do you understand or not?

**Indian man (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is your answer?

**Indian man (2):**
I answered that...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. You answer me. I am talking with you. [break]

**Indian man (2):**
... I didn't know...

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, in our building we have got the most comfortable situation. There is no such sanitary arrangement in any of the temples. But we are trying to give them. Because we deal..., we're dealing in a different atmosphere.

**Indian man (1):**
People of the different countries even.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And they are...

**Indian man (1):**
They are not habituated...

**Prabhupāda:**
They are not habituated...

**Indian man (1):**
...with this...

**Prabhupāda:**
...to go on the field and pass, evacuate.

**Indian man (1):**
...to pass their obnoxious and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then it will be a great difficulty for them.

**Indian man (1):**
...great difficulties for them. And to...

**Prabhupāda:**
They must be given, as far as possible, their Western type of comforts and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Indian man (1):**
And they're born and brought up with this...

**Prabhupāda:**
They have sacrificed so much for me. They are ready to lie down under the tree. But it is my duty to see that, as far as possible, they're comfortably situated. That is my duty. They can agree to live in any condition.

**Indian man (2):**
Gargamuni said me like this one day, and myself and one of the devotee went to draw the ration from the river in the distance, two miles off. And the devotee's saying, "We'll go by their car." and, "Let us go by the rickshaw."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they do like that.

**Indian man (2):**
I like to save the paths of the temple. And that devotee's not... Up till devotee, but he was a worker, his whole time living in the temple. And I asked to Gargamuni, "Your devotee is saying, 'We'll go by car.' It is expensive. Because we are collecting money from the different peoples and from the public, and we must not use our money in this way."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// For Kṛṣṇa //bhakti,// yes.

**Indian man (2):**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Indian man (2):**
[Bengali] [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
...who are very much attracted to living in Māyāpur, residing in Māyāpur. After perfecting their lives, do they sometimes join Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //saṅkīrtana// movement in Goloka Vṛndāvana?

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Let me... [break] Those who are living in Māyāpur, they have already joined.

**Dhanañjaya:**
//Haribol.//

**Prabhupāda:**

> māṁ ca 'vyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena yah sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

"Anyone who has joined devotional service, //avyabhicāreṇa,// without any reservation, he is already liberated." There is no question of liberation for him. //Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.// He's already in the Brahman platform. This is //bhakti.// For a //bhakti,// there is no question of liberation. He's already liberated. A millionaire is already rich. He doesn't require to become rich. It is automatically. [break]

**Indian man (3):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is just to give His personal example that a //sannyāsī// should not be very much intimately mixing with rich men. That is by His personal example. He was a //sannyāsī.// He refused to see a king, because a king is supposed to be always busy in material affairs. So if... For the general people aspiring to go back to home, back to Godhead, for them, to mix with the materialistic person is forbidden. //Viṣayiṇāṁ sandarśanam atha yoṣitāṁ ca// [[books:cc:madhya:11:8|[Cc. Madhya 11.8]]]. Those who are //viṣayī,// simply engaged in sense gratification, and //yoṣitām... Yoṣitām// means women or enjoyable things.

**Indian man (1):**
Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Indian man (1):**
Many religious institution, they welcome the rich peoples. Those who are coming by cars, and those who are coming gorgeously, and they are donating much to the institutions, they are welcomed by the people, management of these institutions. And this is your version. It is just contradictory. I accept your version. It is quite, quite right. And I hope our institution must do not like that. This ISKCON must not do like that. The well-to-do peoples who come, they'll get more [indistinct], more receptions, more congratulations. I request it must be your directions that our institution ISKCON must not do like this. And it is your... [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
But one..., one thing is that we are not living like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. [laughter]

**Indian man (1):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He was ideal //sannyāsī,// and He was living apart from any material attachment. But we have to do preaching work. We have to construct temple, comfortable temple. So who will pay for that?

**Indian man (1):**
Then your version...

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore we have to sometimes do that.

**Indian man (1):**
Yes. Out of necessity.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like that woman, that chaste woman. She served a prostitute...

**Indian man (1):**
To make them correct.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Serve prostitute for serving her husband. That is a big story.

**Indian man (2):**
Big story, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Lakṣa-hīra.

**Indian man (1):**
Lakṣa-hīra. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You know that, Lakṣa-hīra.

**Indian man (1):**
And husband was a...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (1):**
And he requested his Lakṣa-hīra that "I want to go one night to the..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, to the prostitute and her pay, her fee, was //lakṣa-hīra,// one hundred thousand pieces of diamond. You see.

**Indian man (1):**
Yes. I know that, that story.

**Prabhupāda:**
So for the satisfaction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we sometimes do that. But we collect money from them not for our sense gratification, but constructing this temple.

**Indian man (1):**
For the general public and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (1):**
...country and...

**Prabhupāda:**
And unless we have got temple like this, nobody would come. If I sit down here, "Bhaktivedanta Swami is sitting here," nobody will come. [laughter]

**Indian man (1):**
But people, like poor people, like come to the [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
But Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is God. He can attract any man. But I am not God. I have to attract people by some opulence.

**Indian man (2):**
But Prabhupāda, in the beginning, you attracted in the park everyone. When you went to America, you were chanting and attracting people just in the park. Same place. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, at that time, only Brahmānanda was attracted. [laughter] Not you. Not you.

**Indian man (2):**
Only because he was sincere soul.

**Prabhupāda:**
This Brahmānanda and Acyutānanda, they first danced in my chanting in the park. The photograph was published in the Times of New York.

**Indian man (1):**
And I heard that your first devotee in America, Kīrtanīyā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Indian man (1):**
Kīrtanīyā Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kīrtanānanda Swami.

**Indian man (1):**
Kīrtanānanda Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, he is next. He is next.

**Indian man (1):**
Oh, yes. I met him.

**Prabhupāda:**
He came next. Brahmānanda came first.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
No, I came first. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
No. You were present in that Tompkinson Square?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Before that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Before that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, before that. Yes, yes. Yes, I...

**Indian man (1):**
I asked him. And somebody, some devotee...

**Prabhupāda:**
Brahmānanda, you are defeated. [laughter] So //kīrtana// is glorious than //brahma-jñāna.// [laughter]

**Indian man (1):**
And some devotee introduced me with him, that "He is the first devotee of Prabhupāda in America, in foreign."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He's also a priest's son, coming from very respectable, priestly order family.

**Indian man (1):**
Last few days, we were enjoying a good day.

**Indian man (2):**
But there are so many disciples of one //guru.// Are they come all in bona fide disciplic succession?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Well, everyone is in a bona fide disciplic succession provided he keeps that tradition. Keeps that tradition. //Āpani ācari prabhu jīve śikhāilā// [Caitanya Mahāprabhu]. One must behave that "I belong to this disciplic succession. I must keep myself fit for the post." Then it is all right. If he deviates, then he deviates the disciplic succession. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [pause] Caitanya Mahāprabhu says frankly that... This is disciplic succession: //āmāra ājñāya,// "Just carry out My order." Then you are in disciplic succession. If you do not keep yourself in the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then simply by becoming disciple you are not in the disciplic succession. This is disciplic succession. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said this clearly, //āmāra ājñāya guru haña tāra ei:// "Wherever you live, you become a spiritual master." How? //Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]: "Whomever you meet, you only speak what Kṛṣṇa has instructed." Then you are disciplic succession. It doesn't matter what you are and where you are. It doesn't matter. This is disciplic succession. And if you think, "Now I am initiated, I am now liberated. I have no other business," then you are not in the disciplic succession. You must preach. That is disciplic succession.

**Indian man (1):**
This is the definition of a disciple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Āmāra ājñāya guru haña tāra ei deśa, yāre dekha...// You have to... Anywhere, any friend, any businessman, "Are you Kṛṣṇa conscious? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." That's all. What is the loss in that? "My dear friend, I request you to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//" Where is the difficulty?

**Brahmānanda:**
Even a child like Sarasvatī, she does.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes? Ah, yes.

**Indian man (1):**
She asks everyone. Every child, she will say: "Jump!" "Jump, Jump, Jump!" And she will...

**Prabhupāda:**
And if he does not, she'll say, "Śyāmasundara, here is a //karmī.//" [laughter] They're... Our //gosāi// in Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, he was smoking. "Mālatī, Mālatī, see this old man is smoking."

**Indian man (2):**
"Take this //bīḍī// out. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," she was telling. "Take out this //bīḍī// and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. "He's smoking //bīḍī.//" This man became little ashamed. "Yes, my girl, I'll give it up by and by." She was surprised that a man is smoking. [//japa//] [break] //...dṛḍha-vrata,// vows, very rigidly. //Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]. So if I'm unable, there is no need of starving. No. Because if you become diseased, then your //bhajana// will be hampered. So you can do it.

**Indian man (1):**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] Or ability, inability, that depends on the person.

**Indian man (3):**
[Bengali conversation] Three hundred and ninety-three pounds.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali conversation] [break] Adjust their cash.

**Indian man (2):**
Cash is different...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. I mean to say, account computer. But they must tally with their daily balance.

**Indian man (2):**
Well, they put in the suspense. When they find out this mistake, that somebody pointed out, then they adjust it. So many times it has happened, because this computer system is not hundred percent efficient.

**Indian man (1):**
One Indian girl, [indistinct], went to London and America and stay on these computers. She was able to work out [indistinct] computers, one...

**Indian man (2):**
She challenged. She challenged.

**Indian man (1):**
Śakuntalā?

**Indian man (2):**
Śakuntalā, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Some girl came to see me. She's little fatty, that girl?

**Indian man (2):**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, I think...

**Indian man (2):**
She printed a photo in the London papers also and challenged that "I can beat any computers in the Western world." [break]

**Indian man (1):**
Under one high court?

**Prabhupāda:**
Under one high court, yes.

**Indian man (2):**
//Āśrama// also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Yes.

**Indian man (3):**
[Bengali] [break]

**Indian man (2):**
During the festival days, those days...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (4):**
...for the last three or four days, many people, specially young men, were asking for cheaper sort of informatory books or leaflets in their own language. And also asking for how they can become members or more closely associated.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is very important.

**Indian man (4):**
With more translational, or a type of...

**Prabhupāda:**
So unfortunately, we haven't got any expert Bengali to do these things.

**Indian man (4):**
In my own way, I am ready to prepare a sample translation of the English books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Welcome. It is a great service.

**Indian man (4):**
But that must be very cheap.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, cheap---we can distribute without price. That is not the question.

**Indian man (4):**
And also they were asking to be associated more in the facilities for Life Membership like that with... They feel it's within their reach.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Life Membership, Life Membership they're... Just like if somebody joins, he's more than Life Member. But if he does not join, then he become Life Member by paying the fees.

**Indian man (4):**
I also...

**Indian man (5):**
I want to be a member, and I wish to resign from my present service. And I wish to dedicate my whole life to...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is your present service?

**Indian man (5):**
At present, I am serving in the steel plant, Hindustan Steel Industry.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, steel plant.

**Indian man (5):**
And I want to..., wish to dedicate my whole life to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is very good proposal.

**Indian man (5):**
And I am a...

**Prabhupāda:**
How far you are educated?

**Indian man (5):**
As long as I will live, I will broom and clean in the temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Very good. That's all right. You go on doing that.

**Indian man (5):**
Okay. And then I will submit my resignation.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is up to you. I cannot say.

**Indian man (5):**
Yes. And my parents are sufficient enough. They have enough land...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārjanādau. Tan-mandira-mārjanādau,// that is also great service. If you guide other people and you do yourself, just to keep the temple very neat and clean, it will be a very, very great service.

**Indian man (5):**
Yes, I am. I am ready to do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, then you are welcome immediately.

**Indian man (5):**
And that is my desire, all, inner desire.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Āpani ācari prabhu jīve śikhāilā.// If you show example how to keep the temple neat and clean, then these foreigners also will learn from you. [break] ...fix for, those who are earning money, they should... But we are giving them book. So our books are worth about three thousand rupees. But we are simply collecting eleven hundred.

**Indian man (4):**
All that they wanted, I understood from the talk, informatory..., informations, I mean, in their own dialect.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, one thing is that at least in Bengal they do not require much information, because this Caitanya Movement is their movement. It is simply a plea. Everyone know that Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to distribute the //hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.// This is the essence, and let them help, //prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā// [SB 10.22.35], by life, by money, by words. This is the movement. Why they are anxious to get information more? That is a plea. Everyone knows what is Caitanya Mahāprabhu, at least in Bengal.

**Bhavānanda:**
I tell them that when they ask.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bhavānanda:**
I say, "Why you are asking me that? You already know."

**Prabhupāda:**
Rather, they are to give information. But this is a plea. //Bhagavad-gītā// is..., was not made in London. [laughter] It was spoken in India. Why they are asking? That means they have become so rascal and fool they do not know what is //Bhagavad-gītā,// what is Caitanya Mahāprabhu? Their position is so low-graded now?

**Indian man (1):**
They do not like to learn it. They do not like to know it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. Is //Bhagavad-gītā// imported from London? Why do they ask like this? How much degraded they have become.

**Indian man (1):**
And our answers must be like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. As if you are... They are importing knowledge from Lenin, these rascals, and they do not know what is //Bhagavad-gītā.// How much degraded they have become, just see.

**Indian man (2):**
They even go as far as to say that this //Bhagavad-gītā// is adulterated now, and...

**Indian man (4):**
Maybe also they...

**Prabhupāda:**
Adulterated?

**Indian man (2):**
Yeah, they say so many things have been added to it. Sometimes some rascals come to criticize to that extent.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that addition?

**Indian man (2):**
Well, when you come to..., when you come to ask a specific answer, they say, "If you bring //Bhagavad-gītā,// we'll show it to you."

**Prabhupāda:**
So bring //Bhagavad-gītā,// but what is the addition?

**Indian man (2):**
This was, this was pointed out by quite a few in the train.

**Indian man (4):**
No, you can ask them at that time, "Please place one book like that which is adulterated, and was somehow or another added in it something."

**Indian man (2):**
But what is their source of knowledge?

**Indian man (4):**
They have no, no source of... They like to

**Indian man (2):**
Speculate...

**Indian man (4):**
They like to convey...

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not know what is //Bhagavad-gītā,// but they can say it is added and subtracted. They're... But they do not know what is //Bhagavad-gītā.// Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
//Sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. There is no adulteration there. Very simple.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you, all Indians, you have to do this. This is simply a plea to avoid. In Bengal, everyone knows Caitanya Mahāprabhu was for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Indian man (4):**
But so far, most of them, perhaps, also wanted informations regarding..., full informations regarding ISKCON.

**Prabhupāda:**
ISKCON. That is a short-cut of "International Society for Krishna Consciousness."

**Indian man (4):**
No, that I know, myself. They wanted to know, in their own language, etc. And for that I meant...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is, it is...

**Indian man (4):**
...a sort of booklet in local dialects, in the Bengali, to be more propagated. More...

**Prabhupāda:**
So I can give you the hints. You prepare a leaflet immediately, and you publish.

**Indian man (4):**
Yes, yes. I... We have already prepared. Already...

**Prabhupāda:**
Come. I shall give you more hints. Immediately come, I shall give you. Only need... [break] They should come forward. That is needed. Otherwise, everything is there.

**Indian man (4):**
I was having discussions with Pāñcajanya Prabhu regarding these things. Even to have them locally printed.

**Bhavānanda:**
Anyway, we can work that out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (2):**
Yeah I don't want to be in Bengali he's give me...

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, it's all taken care of. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
"Waves in the ocean. Let it, let it be stopped. Then I shall start my boat." It will never come.

**Indian man (4):**
Then this is not my intention.

**Prabhupāda:**
It will never come.

**Indian man (4):**
It is not my intention.

**Prabhupāda:**
Start boat immediately, in whatever condition.

**Indian man (4):**
Any circumstance.

**Prabhupāda:**
Any circumstance. That is required.

**Indian man (2):**
We should take it very seriously.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] "First of all let us become economically fit. Then we shall consider our spiritual..." This is nonsense.

**Indian man (1):**
That will never come.

**Prabhupāda:**
All the big, big leaders, they wanted to keep themselves economically fit, but when death came, they had to surrender. "Yes sir, [Bengali]."

**Indian man (4):**
Many leaders are economically...

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not... They're not leaders. I say they're rascals.

**Indian man (4):**
They do not live here, and they must caught hold of it.

**Prabhupāda:**
All these leaders, I must say clearly, they're all rascals, misleaders. Not only in our country, all over the world. Therefore we have started this movement, who is real lea... [break] [end]
