====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...and they would all come to our place in procession, and we shall feed them. This program should be started immediately. And so that the whole day and night this nuisance will go on.

**Gurudāsa:**
Maybe we should occupy the L.I.C. grounds in Delhi with //kīrtana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurudāsa:**
We should occupy the L.I.C. grounds in Delhi with //kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
No... No, you are jumping over... Now, the question is in Bombay. Why you are jumping in Delhi?

**Gurudāsa:**
But they asked us in L.I.C. the same thing. They asked us to leave L.I.C. grounds because the //kīrtana// was nuisance.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that's all right. That chapter is now...

**Gurudāsa:**
I see.

**Prabhupāda:**
...in prominence.

[aside:] Don't come near.

**Devotee:**
We could go to the... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that they're planning the same plan as they did. This is the preliminary sign.

**Gupta:**
Swami Mahārāja, our program should enter the streets in the houses of different people, and //saṅkīrtana// should be start from there, and...

**Prabhupāda:**
So do it. So don't speak; now organize. Now there is no question of speaking. Practical. Everyone should take a leading part, and the //saṅkīrtana// nuisance should be started from Bombay. So Balavanta Prabhu, you are taking?

**Balavanta:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...assistants selected, so many //sannyāsīs,// and do it. You take the leaders.

**Balavanta:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...idea.

**Balavanta:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is intelligence. [break] And we shall pollute the whole world with this nuisance.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya. Haribol.// [breaks]

**Prabhupāda:**
...become an exemplary //gosvāmī// to give fight to the //gosvāmīs// here. You are..., how many years you are in Vṛndāvana? Huh? How many years you are here?

**Gurudāsa:**
Two and half years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Two and a half years. Now you should represent Rūpa Gosvāmī, and you should challenge them, "You are not //gosvāmī;// I am //gosvāmī.//" But you have to be exemplary. Do you know what is the definition of //gosvāmī?//

**Gurudāsa:**
One who works hard for Kṛṣṇa day and night and one who controls his senses.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is the first thing. //Vāco vegaṁ krodha-vegam udara-vegam upastha-vegaṁ manasa-vegam, etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt// [//NoI// 1]. One who can control these kinds of urges, //vāco vegam,// talking nonsense---that is called //vāco vegam. Krodha-vegam,// anger. Urges of the mind. Mind dictates, "Do this, do that." Then //udara-vegam,// eating //vegam.// "Eat more, more, more." //Udara-vegam. Upastha-vegam:// genital. When one can control these six //vegān,// urges, then he is fit for becoming //gosvāmī,// and he can make //śiṣya// all over---//śiṣya,// disciple---all over the world. //Pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt.// This is //gosvāmī.// Not that a business. [Hindi] Is there any mention //Bhāgavata-saptāha// in the //Bhāgavatam?// There are so many big, big commentators. They have never recommended. But this business is going on. They are holding //Bhāgavata-saptāha// and bringing money and employing it for the sons', daughters' marriage very opulently. And the..., their supporters, they're also invited. They say, "Oh, here is a //gosvāmī.//" This is going on here. [break] ...of //gosvāmī,// there is not a single //gosvāmī.// At least visible. Where is that //vāco vegaṁ krodha-vegam udara upastha-vegam// [NoI 1] control? And where is that //pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt,// all worldwide?

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes, disciples...

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Ah, where is that? //Śiṣya.//

**Devotee:**
You are.

**Prabhupāda:**
I may be whatever I am. That's all. But this is the definition of //gosvāmī.// Besides that, there are other, many things.

> nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau
> lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau
> rādhā-kṛṣṇa-padāravinda-bhajanānandena-mattālikau
> vande rūpa-sanā...

So //nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇa.// One must be very conversant all kinds of //śāstras.// And what for? For establishing real religion. Real religion is this: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Why there are other religions existing? That means there is no //gosvāmīs. Gosvāmī...// If there is //gosvāmī,// he should stop functioning all other rascal religions. Simply this: //mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja,// that religion. That is religion. And all bogus thing. A //gosvāmī// has to prove that. //Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-ni..., lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.// Why? For the benefit of the whole human society. Therefore they should be honored. //Tri-bhuvane mānyau.// Not that within some neighborhood. All over the world. //Tri-bhuvane.// That is //gosvāmī.// What is this //gosvāmī? Tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau.// He is fit to take shelter of. A cheating //gosvāmī,// cheating //gosvāmī// is no good.

**Gurudāsa:**
I also... I also, the first day checked the //pāṇḍā// out because he wouldn't eat //prasādam// with us. He said, "I am Vaiṣṇava. I cannot eat amongst you." So I said, "Then we cannot hear from you. Go immediately." The first day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. That's all right.

**Devotee:**
He wanted to go and have tea. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...money, but not your //prasāda.//

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Money's pure. [laughter] And //prasāda,// because it is offered to Kṛṣṇa, it is impure. Just see their argument. Money is pure. Even you can give me with your hand as much as you like. Because it is pure, I'll take it. And so far //prasāda// is concerned, because it is offered to Kṛṣṇa, therefore I cannot take it. [break] Oh, yes. She has got the power. Shaktimati Sar. Some... The police commissioner has remarked, "This //bhajana// is nuisance." So we have to agitate. There are so many Vaiṣṇavas. //Bhajana// is nuisance? Eh?

**Indian lady:**
It's my life.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there must be some big agitation to drive away this man. The demand should be that "This man should be immediately removed. He has focused a sarcastic remark on a very pure religious system." This movement should be started. He must be removed immediately.

**Balavanta:**
We can hold protest marches downtown.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
Large. Large-scale protest marches.

**Balavanta:**
All the Vaiṣṇavas will come with us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You have to organize all... There are many Vaiṣṇavas. Huh? In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //satataṁ kīrtayanto mām// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]]: one has to chant "Kṛṣṇa" always. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]. And this rascal is saying "Nuisance." So it is not possible to invoke an agitation against this? What right he has got to say nuisance? He could have spoken in a sweet language, that "The //bhajana// may be very good for the devotees, but it creates disturbance to the others. Therefore we cannot allow." I say like that. But they cannot still stop //bhajana.// But he has remarked the //bhajana:// "Nuisance." This very word will kill him if you make proper agitation.

**Gurudāsa:**
That means the whole government is feeling that way. Otherwise he would not feel strong in saying it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is a fact, but we have to become strong.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. We must defeat them all.

**Balavanta:**
We can mainly single out him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Balavanta:**
We can mainly single him out for now and protest against him, make him the example.

**Gurudāsa:**
Make an example of him.

**Balavanta:**
[aside, explaining to others:] The man in Bombay, government leader. //He's// a nuisance.

**Prabhupāda:**
There are many parties in Bombay, //kīrtana// parties. You have to organize them and bring them. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa everywhere. Create this nuisance. And Maharashtra is the country of Tukaram. He organized //kīrtana.// Still the Tukaram //kīrtana// parties are there. Viṭṭhala. Viṭṭhala means Kṛṣṇa. An ideal //gosvāmī// should remain here to challenge these false //gosvāmīs.// But if you also become false, then you cannot challenge. [break] ...ducks have come, we can talk with them. Mr. Gupta, your //batakhs,// they have come. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa! //Jayo.// [Hindi]

[break] ...have sufficient quantity of grains, then you are //dhanavān.// This is all false, so-called //dhanavān.// [Hindi conversation] //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. If you want to flourish, you must have sufficient grains. Where is that grain? Some... Lecture [Hindi]. What is that lecture? Where is //anna?// [break] [Hindi] This is going on. [describes in Hindi how //Bhāgavatam// describes the present government leaders as dogs, hogs, camels and asses, amongst other topics] //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. This is the only... [Hindi conversation] Our movement is Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. Everyone knows. [Hindi conversation with Indian lady continues for some time]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Just like Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Just like Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Still they are told that Kṛṣṇa is God, and they still do not heed the warning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let them accept at least like Dhṛtarāṣṭra. That is also good. Therefore Dhṛtarāṣṭra was saved at the end, in spite of so many things. By the help of Vidura, he left home and became successful, because he believed in Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa is God, yes. But I cannot control myself." He admitted his deficiency. Therefore he was liberated. //Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt// [[books:bg:2:40|[Bg. 2.40]]]. Because he admitted Kṛṣṇa is God, therefore at the end he was liberated. //Mahato bhayāt.//

**Bhāgavata:**
But Duryodhana would not admit.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bhāgavata:**
But Duryodhana would not. Even though Kṛṣṇa showed His universal form, Duryodhana still did not agree.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Duryodhana also agreed. All of them got salvation. That is mentioned. Anyone who was in the Battle of Kurukṣetra, all of them got salvation. By their being killed in the battle, they all got liberation and salvation. That is stated by Bhīṣmadeva. //Svarūpa. Svarūpa// means they came to their original Kṛṣṇa consciousness. All of them. [//japa//] [break] [Hindi conversation continues for some time] Materially to get //bācche// [children], you require the help of husband, but spiritually you don't require anyone's help. In Kṛṣṇa only. That's all.

**Bhāgavata:**
//Jaya.// [end]
