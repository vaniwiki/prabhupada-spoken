====== Morning Walk ======

[laughter]

**Gurudāsa:**
Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sometimes they visit: kill them.

[laughs] But don't kill my mistake.

**Gurudāsa:**
None of our own men.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. If you live twenty-five, he'll never come. But we should be careful.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Then they will [indistinct]. [break]

**Gurudāsa:**
//...kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Not //kīrtana. Kīrtana, ārati, bhoga,// lecture---so many ways. I have explained this.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...big hotel, ISKCON Vegetarian Hotel.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Five star.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One of the big points is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...five star hotel. It must be very gorgeous.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
International [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Now immediately submit plan and... Where is Saurabha?

**Gurudāsa:**
Saurabha? He's here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where you get plan for hotel in Bombay?

**Saurabha:**
Inside?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Full front of the land, whole front land. No temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whole...

**Saurabha:**
Only hotel.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. With a hall, hall on the ground floor, covering the whole land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not for the whole ground floor. First floor.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
First floor. On the first floor, one big, big hall.

**Saurabha:**
Yes. Only hotel. One plan.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You have got the site plan of the land?

**Saurabha:**
Yes, I have all the plans at Bombay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Then you can make a sketch.

**Saurabha:**
Yes. [break] ...plan.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One thing you should know, Prabhupāda. Two hotels in that area are being sold. [note: "Hotel" in India may mean merely a restaurant]

**Prabhupāda:**
Let them be sold. Our hotel does not depend on them. We are always independent.

**Gurudāsa:**
Why are they being sold? For lack of people coming?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Whatever the reason may be doing, they...

**Prabhupāda:**
Two hotels?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Two. King's Hotel, and Horizons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Are for sale, or they have been sold?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They are selling. The owners are selling.

**Prabhupāda:**
So...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They say... I spoke with one hotel man, and he says the cost of petrol is now three rupees, twenty-five paisa per liter.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Petrol now costs three rupees twenty-five per liter. That means about three or four times what it was previously. So people are not so much inclined. Since they have their business in the city, if they stay in Juhu...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is one of the reasons.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...they have to go all the way from Juhu into the city. It costs twenty-five rupees by taxi.

**Gurudāsa:**
This is happening all over the world to the hotel business.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurudāsa:**
All over the world. All over the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hotel business declining?

**Gurudāsa:**
All over. Because of the petrol shortage.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But it's not permanent.

**Gurudāsa:**
They'll have to do something, because...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's not permanent. The thing is that our Life..., if we put up a hotel, Prabhupāda, all of our Life Members, at least, I know for a fact, will use the hotel. Plus many foreigners will still use. Because we are not..., we are not... Our hotel will not simply be for the business foreigners.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is for spiritual culture.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Spiritual culture. Right. So for that purpose it makes no difference the center of the city or elsewhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...dependent any condition. We are independent. And you are criticizing [indistinct] and that garden. And if you think that there is no possibility of temple being sanctioned, then we start hotel. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, that is already there. But if the sanction is not there, what we will do? Keep the land vacant? [break] That I am trying to get sanction, "Is it all right?" If you don't, then hotel.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Otherwise build a hotel in the front and a temple in the rear.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And then it satisfies both. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
No. The same view. Eh?

**Devotee:**
Yeah. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
One man's walking, Letchmore Heath.

**Devotee:**
Like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is like this. Atmosphere is little different. It was cold out. The sky is not so clear. Otherwise, land view is the same. [break]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
...remembering that Kṛṣṇa's here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
There's always the memory that Kṛṣṇa's here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Kṛṣṇa is everywhere.

**Satsvarūpa:**
When Prabhupāda was walking in Letchmore Heath, he said, "This looks like Govardhana Hill."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Bicyclist:**
[ringing bell] Hare Kṛṣṇa! Hare Kṛṣṇa! Hare Kṛṣṇa! Hare Kṛṣṇa!

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotee:**
It's like you said last night. They begin to chant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
Do the rickshaw drivers in Letchmore Heath chant Hare Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they are sleeping. [laughter] That is Western. Here you will find even the old man rises early in the morning. Yes. Takes bath---without any reference to Hare Kṛṣṇa. They chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the village, they take bath early in the morning. That is very healthy. [break] ...I have generally red color. Why it is silver color? [microphone moving]

**Satsvarūpa:**
Mixed with moisture?

**Prabhupāda:**
That I do not know. The scientists say that it is a blazing fire, sun planet. Fire is generally red color with little yellow. Why it is white? We have no experience of fire, white. So how do they say it is fire? That is my question. [break] ...explain why it is? Blue I have seen. Red we have seen. Where is white?

**Gurudāsa:**
Also you can get the science theory of reflection of //brahma-jyotir?//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another. First of all, you answer whether it is fire or something else. [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...dew.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is the moisture? It is clear sky. Where is the moisture? [break] [laughter] It is not fire. It is a brilliant body. It is not fire. [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...body of Vivasvān?

**Prabhupāda:**
Whole planet, I mean the population, they're so bright.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Sometimes in your lectures you explain the living entities can live there because they have bodies of fire.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fiery, not fire.

**Gurudāsa:**
Fiery.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because there is heat and brightness, therefore they can say fire. Just like, what is called, diamond. Diamond looks like bright, like this. But that is not fire. Diamond, real diamond, you keep in dark room, it will be light. But that is not fire.

**Devotee:**
Effulgent.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Bright. Brightness. [microphone moving] [break]

**Devotee:**
What are the stars?

**Prabhupāda:**
Stars? They are planets like this planet---like moon planet, the moon planet. //Nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśī// [[books:bg:10:21|[Bg. 10.21]]]. The stars, they are so many moons, not suns. They say sun, and we say, "No, it is moon." Sun is only one. In each universe there is one sun, but there are many planets like moons.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Reflection.

**Prabhupāda:**
Reflection. We get it from //Bhagavad-gītā. Nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśī.// [break] [microphone moving] ...it is due to the sun, reflected.

**Gurudāsa:**
Why is it that the moon reflects? They say the moon is sandy, but this sand here is not reflecting.

**Prabhupāda:**
That... They are not going to the moon planet. They are going to some other planet, Rāhu planet.

**Gurudāsa:**
Rāhu?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There are many planets unvisible. So there is a Rāhu planet which comes in front of the moon planet, and that is called eclipse. So there is a planet rotating. I think they are going to that Rahu planet, not to the moon planet.

**Haṁsadūta:**
How can they make such a mistake?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Haṁsadūta:**
How is it that they made such a big mistake?

**Prabhupāda:**
Their whole life is mistake. [laughter] They cannot do anything but mistake. Why you are so much confident about that? Their whole life is simply mistake.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda, they see a little fire, and they see that it has heat and light, and so they see a huge thing having heat and light, and so they conclude that that's also a fire. So if that's their deductive method, then if they see that whenever there's intelligence there must be a person, then why don't they conclude that behind the universe there's so many wonderful things that there must also be a person?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, we say there are persons, combination of fiery persons. Therefore it looks so bright.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Is the brightness of a diamond because of the presence of a //jīva?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Akṣayānanda:**
The brightness...?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Akṣayānanda:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Suppose you get a diamond body. Just like glowworm. Huh? Glowworm, it has a glowing body, that's all. But the glowing substance is different from the soul. Owner of the body is different. What he's doing? [break] He came the other day, morning?

**Indian man:**
[indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...have purchase this land for him for preaching Christian Bible. So he..., maybe he was getting some salary and this land in this way. He gave up Gauḍīya Maṭha association and he became Christian. So I know that this land belonged to him. His wife was there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Allahabad.

**Prabhupāda:**
Maybe at Allahabad. He's the proprietor. He was Mr. Cakravarti. [indistinct] [break] [end]
