====== Morning Walk, partially recorded ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...incidences are so described that anyone can remember. And by remembering these incidences, he becomes liberated. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Indian man:**
One thing I want to know, you see, when He was Supreme God, why He created all these //līlās?// When..., suppose He was sent...

**Prabhupāda:**
What do you mean by Supreme God?

**Indian man:**
Er, He was the Lord of universe. All the...

**Prabhupāda:**
So He cannot do that?

**Indian man:**
No, He can do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then?

**Indian man:**
That is..., so He has done. But as He sent Uddhava to Vṛndāvana to know about condition of Vṛndāvana people, even He was God, He knew it, no?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is affection.

**Indian man:**
Hmm?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is affection. Just like you go to your friend, you know what he is; still you ask, "How are, you are?"

**Indian man:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is natural.

**Indian man:**
Then he'll answer. Very affection

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man:**
But He had also... When He was God, why He had some affection also like that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that you must know.

**Indian man:**
//Māyā...// I, I, I say to //māyā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is not. //Māyā// mean affection also. //Māyā// mean affection also. //Māyā// has got the meaning of affection. //Māyā// means illusion; //māyā// means energy; //māyā// means affection. Just like we say //māyā...,// //chele rupar//[?] //māyā.// That is affection.

**Indian man:**
[Hindi] affection.

**Prabhupāda:**
So //māyā// means affection.

**Indian man:**
But when He was born, why should He have //māyā?// When He is the Supreme God, [Hindi]?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] Can you control God? By your wording, He'll not be affected by //māyā.//

**Indian man:**
No, that means I have...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is God. That is God. He can do anything. He is not under your rules and regulation. //Māyā..., māyā..., māyā// means... //Māyā// means..., //māyā mukta// [[books:cc:madhya:24:136|[Cc. Madhya 24.136]]] means the illusion. When the //māyā// is illusion, you have to get you out it. But when the...

**Indian man:**
But what is the differnce between the illusion and //māyā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Illusion is forced. But affection is not forced. When father loves child, that is not forced; that is reality. [break] [end]
