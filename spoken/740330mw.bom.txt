====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like bodily action. Now you feel call of nature, so you have to pass urine.

**Chandobhai:**
No, that is correct.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all

**Dr. Patel:**
Does not attach.

**Chandobhai:**
That action, you're not attached.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
At least, you are, you are...

**Chandobhai:**
//Udāsī, udāsīno...// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The sum total is how to become //guṇātīta.// That is //bhakti-yoga.//

**Chandobhai:**
That is //bhakti-yoga.// Last stage of //bhakti,// finally, is said like that, //māṁ ca yo avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena sevate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is the only //guṇātīta// position.

**Chandobhai:**
But these qualities are the test of that man.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Chandobhai:**
After he attains that, these qualities are the test of that man, how we can test that man.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, testing, that is also stated. Just like these Europeans, Americans, in their previous position, they had many bad habits. But somehow or other, they have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is their position, //guṇātīta.// Even by habit they commit something mistake, that is not to be taken into account. Because... Just hear. Just like a fan is moving, and make the switch off. So the switch is off. That is first consideration. And after the switch being off, the fan is moving, that is no consideration. Do you understand? Because the fan was in force, so you..., although you have made the switch off, still moving.

**Chandobhai:**
Still moving, yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not to be taken into account.

**Chandobhai:**
That is not to be... Yes, correct. Because old, past actions.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Chandobhai:**
Just that that wheel has to move.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Chandobhai:**
And will stop of its own.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. That... Because the switch is now off, it will stop. //Śaśvad bhavati dharmātmā. Śaśvad bhavati dharmātmā// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. Because he has taken to the shelter of Kṛṣṇa, therefore his all past business is finished. Although, due to past habit, sometimes you find some mistake, it is not to be taken. Because this thing will go.

**Chandobhai:**
This thing will go. That is a part of past actions.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very soon. Yes. Very soon.

**Chandobhai:**
Just that wheel has to move and it will stop of its own, because you are not giving further impediment.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Śaśvad bhavati...// What is that verse? //Śaśvad bhavati dharmātmā.// That?

**Chandobhai:**
//Śaśvac chāntiṁ adhigacchati, kaunteya pratijānīhi...// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. //Na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati.//

**Chandobhai:**
[quotes Sanskrit in background] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...may be callous. Just like some..., somebody was asking me... That rascal Bharati's article. Who? That one Australian //sannyāsī.// So this rascal may speak something, but we cannot stop our movement. You see? Our movement is increasing, all over the world in..., in spite of all criticism. We don't care for that. Because we know that we are following the footsteps of predecessor //ācārya,// that's all right. We don't mind. And actually, it is happening. Otherwise, within six, seven years, so much progress could not be possible. [break] What is the word, exact?

**Chandobhai and Dr. Patel:**
//Ārambha. Ārambha. Ārambha.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ārambha.//

**Chandobhai:**
//Ārambha.// [indistinct] //ārambha parityāgī.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...its another meaning is "beginning."

**Dr. Patel:**
Beginning. That's right. Beginning of work.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there is no beginning. Just like it is already taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so why should he take something else? Begin here. That should continue.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ārambha-patavat. Ārambha// is a //rudanta.//

**Prabhupāda:**
And another, //ārambhara.// That is..., that is..., that is humbug, humbugism, //ārambhara.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ārambhar// means this //ārambha.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ārambhar.//

**Chandobhai:**
//Sarva-ārambha.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ārambha// means beginning. So it is already began, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is the new thing, you begin this, you begin that? No. No more. That's all right. Final. //Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
But even then you have got to eat. You have got to go to W.C...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is going on. That is going on...

**Dr. Patel:**
On these... These //ārambha-parityāgī.// You don't take any, any cognizance of these works being done by the body. I think, that is to my mind, the exact meaning. I have not been able to grasp and I wanted too.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that I have already explained. If you have taken seriously Kṛṣṇa consciousness, so something happening due to my past habit, you should not take care of it. It will subside.

**Chandobhai:**
//Ārambha.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sarva-ārambha parityāgī.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the final conclusion of... Final conclusion, that if anyone has taken devotional service seriously, //avyabhicāriṇi, avyabhicāriṇi. Avyabhicāriṇi// means as instructed by the spiritual master. If one takes this business very seriously, and he's executing that, then he's //guṇātīta.// That's all.

**Dr. Patel:**
[Sanskrit]

**Chandobhai:**
//Brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham...// [[books:bg:14:27|[Bg. 14.27]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Brahma// means //Vedas. Brahma// means... There are so many things. So many things. So here //brahmaṇaḥ, brahma-jyotir.// People are very much impersonalist, they think realization of //brahma-jyotir// is final. To, just to reply them, this is, this //śloka// is: //brahmaṇo aham pratiṣṭha.// Wherefrom this //jyoti's// coming? This is very common sense. A //jyoti// does... Just like this //jyoti,// this clearness, no darkness, wherefrom it is coming? Everyone knows it is coming from the sun. Without this sun, why at night there was no such //jyoti?// Because the sun is rising, therefore this //jyoti// has come. Similarly...

**Dr. Patel:**
[talking in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, why don't you hear?

**Dr. Patel:**
I am hearing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not... Just hear. It is very important point, that //jyoti,// it must come through some source.

**Chandobhai:**
//Jyoti// has..., //jyoti// has to come through source, correct.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And that is confirmed in the //Brahmā-saṁhitā// that //yasya prabhā. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagadaṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi vibhūti-bhinnam// [Bs. 5.40]. This creation, all the whole creation, even this material, that is depending on the //brahma-jyotir.// Therefore it is said, //sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma:// everything is depending on the //brahma-jyotir.// And that is confirmed also in the //Bhagavad-gītā: mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. This //mat-sthāni// means...

**Chandobhai:**
Within the Brahman.

**Prabhupāda:**
Within the Brahman. And this Brahman is the effulgence of body of Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
That is... Sahajanand Swami says continually that you must always..., you must never think that Kṛṣṇa is without a body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dr. Patel:**
He always says that you must never think that Kṛṣṇa [indistinct] is without body.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Without body there cannot be anything, and Kṛṣṇa had body, and all this is the //brahma-jyotir.// [break] //...pratiṣṭha.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore...

**Chandobhai:**
//Amṛtasyaiva...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Amṛtasya.//

**Dr. Patel:**
That the Brahman is //amṛta.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Amṛta.// Brahman. That is confirmed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. So the Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān, they are, these, one and the same. But it is the person's realization. Now, common man, they can understand what is this sunshine, but they cannot know what is the sun globe or what is within the sun globe.

**Chandobhai:**
What is within the sun globe. Yes, correct.

**Prabhupāda:**
So those who are satisfied only //brahma-jyotir,// their knowledge is not yet perfect. They do not know wherefrom the //brahma-jyotir// comes, who is the source of //brahma-jyotir.//

**Chandobhai:**
So He has stated here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...as Paramātmā, He's //kṣetra-jña// of everybody.

**Dr. Patel:**
So He knows the working of everybody.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kṣetra-kṣetrajñayor jñānam yat taj jñānaṁ mataṁ mama// [[books:bg:13:3|[Bg. 13.3]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Tat kṣetraṁ yac ca yādṛk yad-vikāri yataś ca yat, sa ca yat...// [[books:bg:13:4|[Bg. 13.4]]]. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...prajña.// This point must be clearly understood. Then you go further. A //kṣetra...// This body is //kṣetra. Kṣetra// means "the field of activities." Just like a //kṛṣana// works in his field, and he reaps his result. As he works, he gets the result. Similarly, this body is //kṣetra,// and we are working with this body, and we are reaping the result. //Karmaṇa daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. //Karmaṇa.// So this is the //kṣetra// and //kṣetra-jña.// Now... And next He says that "I am also //kṣetra-jña.// I am also //kṣetra-jña.//" How He's //kṣetra-jña?// Because He's Paramātmā.

**Dr. Patel:**
He's the presiding...

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore... Therefore there are two //kṣetra-jñas:// one, the //jīvātmā,// and one, the Paramātmā. The Māyāvādīs do not accept it. They say the only //kṣetra-jñaḥ. Jivātmā// and Paramātmā the same.

**Chandobhai:**
//Dvau suparṇā...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is confirmed by the //Upaniṣads.//

**Chandobhai:**
//Dvau suparṇā// are there...

**Prabhupāda:**
There are two birds.

**Dr. Patel:**
In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said.

**Prabhupāda:**
Two birds, two birds. Yes. Two birds. //Bhagavad-gītā,// it is clearly said. //Anumantā upadraṣṭā.// One //kṣetra-jña// is //anumantā// and //upadraṣṭā;// another //kṣetra-jña// is not //anumantā.// He's simply enjoying.

**Dr. Patel:**
But that is... //Dvāv imau puruṣau loke kṣaraś cākṣara..., kṣaraḥ sarvāṇi bhūtāni kūṭa-stho 'kṣara ucyate// [[books:bg:15:16|[Bg. 15.16]]]. //Uttamaḥ puruṣas tv anyaḥ paramātmety...// [[books:bg:15:17|[Bg. 15.17]]] [break] //...uttama puruṣa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Kṣara// and //akṣara// means conditioned soul and liberated soul. Those who are in the Vaikuṇṭha world, spiritual world, they are all liberated souls. And those who are within this material world, they are conditioned souls. So...

**Dr. Patel:**
Shall I read again.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, let us finish. So this should be clearly understood, that in this body both the Paramātmā and //jīvātmā// living.

**Dr. Patel:**
Stay together, live together.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But the Māyāvādīs, they says there is no //jīvātmā.// The same thing, Paramātmā. That is not.

**Dr. Patel:**
Those two birds are living on the same tree.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the difference. That is the difference. Paramātmā and //jīvātmā,// what is the difference? Kṛṣṇa says that //sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.// I... This is very practical, that I am the //jīvātmā.// I am living in this body. I know the business of my body, pains and pleasures, but I do not know what is the pains and pleasures of your body. You also do not know what is the pains and pleasures... Therefore we are individual. But Paramātmā, because He's there, He knows what is your pains and pleasure, what is my pains and pleasure. Not only you, but all living entities. That is Paramātmā. So those who are falsely claiming that "I am Paramātmā," this is the test: "Whether you are cognizant of everything?"

**Dr. Patel:**
Right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But you cannot falsely claim that "I am Paramātmā," or "I am God." Whether you have got this all-pervading knowledge? This is the only test to the pretenders that he is God, he is Paramātmā.

**Dr. Patel:**
But that is... They will say that //kṣetra-jña,// not //kṣetra. Mahā-bhūtāny ahaṅkāro buddhir avyaktam eva...// [[books:bg:13:6|[Bg. 13.6]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now He comes to the material elements.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Icchā dveṣaḥ sukhaṁ duḥkhaṁ...// [[books:bg:13:7|[Bg. 13.7]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is... That is...

**Dr. Patel:**
Why they should be in great...? I don't understand that.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Dr. Patel:**
I mean, these are all //mahā-bhūtāny ahaṅkāra buddhiḥ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
But //icchā dveṣaḥ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Icchā...// The... [break] Mind is also material.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Saṅghātaś cetanā dhṛtiḥ// [[books:bg:13:7|[Bg. 13.7]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, yes. //Cetanā,// intelligence, everything, everything. These are all... These are all material.

**Dr. Patel:**
That is, what do you call, the //liṅga-śarīra.//

**Prabhupāda:**
But the... Some foolish people accept the intelligence, mind, as spirit.

**Dr. Patel:**
No, no, I understand not.

**Chandobhai:**
That is Sāṅkhya philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Chandobhai:**
That is Sāṅkhya philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Etat kṣetraṁ samāsena sa-vikāram...// Now, //amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir...// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.8]]]. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the first thing, //ācāryopāsanam.// But these rascals, they do not do that. They have no //ācārya;// still, they write comment on //Bhagavad-gītā.// You see? This is the rascaldom. //Ācāryopāsanam.// One must go... //Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.// Unless one accepts //ācārya,// he does not know anything.

**Dr. Patel:**
And then //amānitvam adambhitvam...//

**Prabhupāda:**
First of all, try to understand one word please. One word, if you understand, your life will be successful. Don't go further. //Ācāryopāsanam.// This is the very important thing.

**Dr. Patel:**
Every, every word is important, //Bhagavad-gītā.// Why one word?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So //ācārya,// who is //ācārya?// Then next question will be: who is //ācārya? Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. Those who are coming the //ācārya-sampradāya.// Śrī-sampradāya, Rudra-sampradāya, the four //sampradāyas.// So unless... //Sampradāya vihīnā ye mantrās te viphalāḥ...// [Padma Purāṇa]. Unless one comes to the //ācārya,// disciplic succession, whatever nonsense he speaks, it is all useless. This is the most important thing, //ācāryopāsanam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Śaucaṁ sthairyam ātma-vinigrahaḥ.// Again I read, eh?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam, ācāryopāsanaṁ śaucaṁ...// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.8]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
So //amānitvam.// Instead of becoming //amānitvam,// these Māyāvādīs say, "I am God." Just see. This is //amānitvam.// He falsely claims that "I have become God now." Does it mean //amānitvam?// And here, Vaiṣṇava says, //gopī-bhartuḥ pāda-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. This is //amānitvam.// This is //amān...// "I am servant of the servant." And these rascals are claiming, "I am God." This is //amānitvam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Adambhitvam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
How much //dambhi,// proud, they are. They are claiming to be God.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ahiṁsā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. //Ahiṁsā// means he's envious of Kṛṣṇa. He's envious. Not //ahiṁsā.// His //hiṁsā// begins that "Why Kṛṣṇa should alone be God? I am also God."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kṣāntiḥ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
So the //hiṁsā// begins from the Supreme. So all negative. These Māyāvādīs, they are //hiṁsā,// they are proud, they have no sense of what is //amānitvam.// This is Māyāvāda philosophy.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kṣāntir ārjavam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
And there cannot be //śanti.// Because... There cannot be. //Śanti// must be there.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kṣānti.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śanti.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kṣā, Kṣā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā, kṣānti. Kṣānti// means toleration. Toleration. But...

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ārjavam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
They, they do not allow Kṛṣṇa to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore there is no //kṣānti,// no toleration.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ācāryopāsanaṁ śaucaṁ sthairyam ātma-vinigrahaḥ. Śaucam sthairyam ātma-vinigrahaḥ, indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Śaucam. Śaucam... Śaucam// means //yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa bāhyābhyantaram śuciḥ.// Because he does not know what is //puṇḍarīkākṣam,// he does not chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, therefore he's not //śaucam.// This is //śaucam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sthairyam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sthairyam// means fixed-up: //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. That is //sthairyam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ātma-vinigrahaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ātma-vinigrahaḥ.// Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam anahaṅkāram eva ca.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Anahan...// This is you, first-class //ahaṅkāra,// that "I have become God."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Asaktir ana...// [break] //...putra-dāra-gṛhādiṣu, nityaṁ ca sama-cittatvam...//

**Prabhupāda:**
So they have no, mean, detachment for //putra-dāra-gṛhādiṣu.// They talk very big, big words, but attached to the //putra-dāra-gṛhādiṣu.// [laughs] This is not knowledge; this is ignorance. The test is there, whether you have become detached from //putra-dāra-gṛhādiṣu.// If not, you are in ignorance. You may talk very, very big, big words. That has no meaning. Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Nityaṁ ca sama-cittatvam iṣṭāniṣṭopapattiṣu, mayi cānanya-yogena...// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.10]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Again the same thing. The basic principle is //mayi cānanya-yogena bhakti-yogena...//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhaktir avyabhicāriṇī vivikta-deśa-sevitvam...// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.11]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
This is... This is the basic principle. Without this, everything is false. Everything is false.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Vivikta-deśa-sevitvam aratir jana-saṁsadi, adhyātma-jñāna-nityatvaṁ tattva artha...//

**Chandobhai:**
//Tattva-jñānārtha...//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Artha-darśanam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam.// When you have perfect knowledge of the //tattva-jñāna.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is //tattva-jñāna.// This is //jñāna.// This is //jñāna.// Basic principle of //jñāna// is //ananya-bhakti-yogena.// That is the basic principle of //jñāna.// Then other things will automatically come.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ajñānaṁ yad ato 'nyathā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore... Therefore in other place in //Bhāgavata: harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. If one is not pure devotee of the Lord, he has no good qualification. That is not possible. Because here is also same thing. The basic principle is devotion. If that is lacking, then all this show, humbug, it has no meaning.

**Dr. Patel:**
No, that is, we have said about the //jñāna...// [break] //...paraṁ brahma na sat...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, who is that //paraṁ brahma?// That Kṛṣṇa. Because Arjuna says, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma...// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
Brahman means Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Brahman is //jyoti.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, //paraṁ brahma. Brahmajyoti,// that is not //paraṁ brahma. Paraṁ brahma// is Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Paraṁ brahma// is Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Paraṁ brahma// is Kṛṣṇa. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. So //paraṁ brahman// is Kṛṣṇa. The //jñāna// means one who knows Kṛṣṇa, he has got knowledge. Otherwise he's a rascal. That's all. Maybe a big rascal or small rascal.

**Dr. Patel:**
Like me.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] But anyone who does not know... That is confirmed in another place: //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. That is the sign. When one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, then it is to be understood that he's really wise. Otherwise...

**Dr. Patel:**
//Anādi mat-paraṁ brahma na sat asat tad ucyate.// Neither //sat// or //asat.// Neither existence or nonexistence.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
What do you mean by //sat.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Sat// and //asat. Asat...// Cause and effect of this material world.

**Dr. Patel:**
Cause and effect. Not existence and nonexistence.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Dr. Patel:**
Cause and effect.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cause and effect. The //mahat-tattva... Mahat-tattva// is cause, and this cosmic manifestation is the effect. So beyond that. Beyond that. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is said: //mahat-pādam.// The //mahat-tattva// is lying at His lotus feet. //Samāśritā ye pada-pallavaṁ plavaṁ mahat-pādam// [SB 10.14.58]. //Mahat-tattva// is lying on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mahat-tattva// is nothing but the beginning of the...

**Prabhupāda:**
It is the total, sum total of material energy.

**Dr. Patel:**
Of cosmic energy, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is //mahat-tattva.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Shall I read further?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādaṁ tat sarvato 'kṣi-śiro-mukham, sarvataḥ śrutimal loke...// [[books:bg:13:14|[Bg. 13.14]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, we are, we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So the my eyes, my hands, my legs, that is Kṛṣṇa's. You see? This is //sarvataḥ pāṇi-pāda.// So if we understand this philosophy, that these eyes...

**Dr. Patel:**
Belong to Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
...these... Belong to Kṛṣṇa. This hand belongs to Kṛṣṇa. But now under... we are under the..., "This is my hand. This is my eye. This is my body." This is illusion.

**Dr. Patel:**
Now this "my" should belong to Kṛṣṇa. Then everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Everything belongs...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything belongs.

**Dr. Patel:**
Ego must belong to Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, so everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, with my hands, with my legs, with my eyes, I cannot do anything except serving Kṛṣṇa. How we can do? If the eyes belong to Kṛṣṇa, then how the eyes can be used for other purpose? This is real knowledge. That is explained in the //Nārada Pañcarātra: sarvopādhi vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. That is //nirmala. Nirmala// eyes. //Brahma-bhūta.// That is //brahma-bhūta// [[books:sb:4:30:20|[SB 4.30.20]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sarvendriya guṇābhāsaṁ sarva-indriya vivarjitam...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Now...

**Dr. Patel:**
//...asaktaṁ sarva-bhūteṣu nirguṇaṁ guṇa-bhoktṛ ca// [[books:bg:13:15|[Bg. 13.15]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
He... He has got //indriyas, indriya.// Just like in the //Vedas// it is stated, //apāṇi-pādo javano gṛhīta.// "He has no hands and legs, but He takes whatever you offer." So now, that, as soon as this word is there, that "He accepts whatever you offer," that means He has got hand. //Indriyābhāsa. Indriyābhāsa.// But not this //indriya,// the three-feet hand. Suppose if you offer me something, you are three feet away, I cannot take it. But Kṛṣṇa is in Vaikuṇṭha. If you offer Him, oh, He can accept. Otherwise... He says, //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. Now He is in Vaikuṇṭha and Goloka Vṛndāvana. We cannot calculate where He is. How He's taking? This is material calculation. But He has got such a hand that anywhere you live, He can accept. Otherwise, if He has no hand... Therefore, "He has no hand" means He has no this little hand like me.

**Dr. Patel:**
He has got no...

**Prabhupāda:**
Unlimited hand. Unlimited hand. That, that you cannot... "How Kṛṣṇa have body, this?" The Māyāvādī philosophers think, "How there can be body? If He has a body, then He has limited potency." He cannot understand that although He has got body, He has got unlimited potency. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ.// That is different from this body. Because he understands that "There cannot be any body different from this," they say //nirākāra.// Not //nirākāra.// He has got body. He has got senses. He has got hand. But not like you.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sarvendriya-guṇābhāsaṁ sarvendriya-vivarjitam...// [[books:bg:3:15|[Bg. 3.15]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Sarvendriya-vivarjitam// means these rascal hands, legs, are //vivarjitam.// But He has got His particular type of hands and legs. That they cannot understand. They, their limited knowledge does not allow them to know that there can be another hand which can be extended millions and millions of miles. That they cannot understand. Therefore //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanu...// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. They think, "Kṛṣṇa is like us. How He can be God?"

This is very important. //Puruṣaḥ sukha-duḥkhānāṁ bhoktṛtve...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, as you, as you... Just like police. Police will punish you. You will have to suffer. But it is due to your criminal action police has arrested you. You cannot make police responsible for your suffering.

**Dr. Patel:**
And here policeman is //jīva,// no? That is what my difficulty is.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. The //prakṛti...// What is that?

**Dr. Patel:**
//Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān...// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, that //puruṣa// means //jīvātmā, jīvātmā.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Jivātmā,// not Paramātmā. That's right.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jivātmā// is within this body, //prakṛti.// This is //prakṛti,// material nature, //jīvātmā.// So as you infect the quality of the //prakṛti,// you become, what is called, entangled.

**Dr. Patel:**
And highest line comes in.

**Prabhupāda:**
You become... I am explaining. You become entangled. Now, as soon as you become entangled... Suppose you become a dog. Now you suffer.

**Dr. Patel:**
But when the dog is there, he does not think he's suffering. He's just like that pig.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is illusion. That is called //moha, moha.// One is suffering. Everyone is suffering. Suppose a big man, a minister, or the prime minister, or the chief minister, he's also suffering.

**Chandobhai:**
Everybody's suffering.

**Prabhupāda:**
But he's thinking, "Now I am prime minister." That is illusion. Nobody, nobody is here peaceful. Everyone is suffering, because threefold miseries. That is the conditional life. After all, Kṛṣṇa says that "If you are thinking that you are very happy, that you must know at least these things: //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]." How you can get out of it? You'll die. Nobody wants to die.

**Dr. Patel:**
Body dies.

**Prabhupāda:**
But these rascals, they do not... Say, "Death is natural." But why don't you like to die? That is suffering. But he thinks, "No, no, it is good." But as soon as I say, "I shall kill you," "No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't kill me. Don't kill me." He does not like to die, but...

**Chandobhai:**
Very helplessly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Helplessly. Just like...

**Dr. Patel:**
I mean, who dies?

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, again you are...

**Dr. Patel:**
Because he has got this... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...identification is all right, but you must come to the practical point. Then don't treat any patient. You can say, "Who is suffering?"

**Dr. Patel:**
"Body."

**Prabhupāda:**
"Who is suffering...?"

**Dr. Patel:**
We are treating the body.

**Prabhupāda:**
"There is no need of taking medicine."

**Dr. Patel:**
I am treating the body. I am not in the... You are treating the...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. That body is there, and you are absorbed in body. Therefore there is suffering. You may say that "I am not this body, and I am just[?] this body," but when the body's going to be killed, you become afraid. Because you are absorbed. Why go beyond this practical point?

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ācchā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like everyone knows that you are not the motorcar. Everyone knows it. But as soon as there is any breakage in the nice motorcar, "Oh, I am gone." Why? Where you gone? You are not motorcar. But because you are absorbed in the sense that "It is my car, my car, my car," you have become absorbed. So any accident to the motorcar, you become unhappy. But everyone knows you are not motorcar. Why you become unhappy? This is called //māyā.// So you are not completely free. So, so long we are in this body, so the sufferings of the body is there. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says that //tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata,// "Just tolerate." Just tolerate.

**Prabhupāda:**
...we do not feed anybody?

**Dr. Patel:**
You may be feeding, but others are throwing it away. That is why they have said //daridra-nārāyaṇa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is... Others are throwing, others are doing this, this... That is not considered.

**Dr. Patel:**
But they have not seen you doing it, you see...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dari...// Why not first of all offer to real Nārāyaṇa and then distribute to the //daridras?// [break] First of all try to understand that... Just like we have got //prasāda// distribution program. So... But that does not mean that we shall say, "We are feeding //daridra-nārāyaṇa.//" We are offering to Nārāyaṇa and then feeding to the...

**Dr. Patel:**
They are... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. You do not talk. You do not know. You do not know. Don't talk. Please stop. I know very well, better than you.

**Dr. Patel:**
How? Tell me. Explain.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. How you can know? You take it; because you do not know, you take it from me.

**Dr. Patel:**
But I, I, I can't take it without you explain me. How I take it? Tell me.

**Prabhupāda:**
That brain will require three hundred years. Your brain having developed, then you will understand.

**Dr. Patel:**
I have developed. Brain is already developed fifty... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you said immediately that "What is the use of offering Nārāyaṇa in the temple..."

**Dr. Patel:**
I did not say that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you said.

**Dr. Patel:**
I did... No, you have misunderstood. I said... I won't submit to wrong things. I will submit to right thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. And that... But you do not know what is right thing. That is your fault.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Daridra-nārāyaṇa// is a fact. In India. And I am going to uphold it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, you see, you are prescribing that "Why they are offering in the temple?" "Why you are offering in the the temple? Why not the //daridras?//"

**Dr. Patel:**
You must offer in the temple. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...does not mean his //nārāyaṇa-seva// is null and void because he cannot distribute to the poor.

**Dr. Patel:**
No, no, that I did not say.

**Prabhupāda:**
Try to understand first this.

**Chandobhai:**
[to Dr. Patel] Hah, Doctor please be quiet.

**Prabhupāda:**
His //nārāyaṇa-seva// is there.

**Dr. Patel:**
I understand him.

**Prabhupāda:**
You will not allow anyone to speak, but you talk nonsense.

**Dr. Patel:**
But you... You won't... You...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. No, you try to understand. That because he cannot distribute food to others, that does not mean his //nārāyaṇa-seva// is null and void.

**Dr. Patel:**
I did not say that, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why you are talking this?

**Dr. Patel:**
I did not say that, and you misunderstood me. That is where I am very... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...does it mean his //nārāyaṇa-seva// is wrong?

**Dr. Patel:**
I don't say that //nārāyaṇa-seva// is wrong.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then it is all right.

**Dr. Patel:**
I did not say that. [break] ...should be given to the people who need it.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is your prescription. But //annakūṭa,// when the //annakūṭa// is there, the //prasāda// is there, either you eat or I eat, it doesn't matter.

**Dr. Patel:**
It should be given... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...attitude. You want to dictate to everyone, although you do not know anything.

**Dr. Patel:**
But you...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is your... Now, you see, understand.

**Dr. Patel:**
I understand...

**Prabhupāda:**
He has performed the //annakūṭa// ceremony. Either you eat or I eat, where is the difference?

**Dr. Patel:**
Great difference. [break] ...what way?

**Prabhupāda:**
Because you do not take //prasādam,// therefore you are not devotee.

**Dr. Patel:**
You... I take this much //prasādam.// They need that much //prasāda.// That is what I mean to say all the while.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, you cannot dictate. //Prasāda... Prasāda... Prasāda// will be distributed without discrimination.

**Dr. Patel:**
Say you are hungry...

**Dr. Shah:**
No, he's saying the same thing. He says without discrimination it is... [break] //...prasādam// is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone is poor.

**Dr. Patel:**
Everyone is poor before God...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
...but those people who are hungry...

**Prabhupāda:**
But why you dictate?

**Dr. Shah:**
That's a different thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is...

**Dr. Patel:**
I don't dictate. I suggest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You say that it should be given to the poor man. You say like that. [break] The spiritual food should be distributed to everyone, without any discrimination.

**Dr. Shah:**
To everyone, without any discrimination. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
It is meant for spiritual understanding.

**Dr. Patel:**
That's right. That I agree.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hanir asyopajāyate// [[books:bg:2:65|[Bg. 2.65]]]. So anyone who is spiritually poor, he should be given //prasādam.// It doesn't matter. [break] That, that makes it clear. //Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]] [indistinct] no discrimination... [end]
