> pravakṣyāmy anasūyave
> jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ
> yaj jñātvā mokṣyase 'śubhāt
> [[books:bg:9:1|[Bg. 9.1]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, the first qualification is //anasūyave.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Anasūyave,// one who is not [indistinct] against God.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. One who is not envious. A person generally... All conditioned souls, they are envious of God. Envious. "Why He should be God? I am God. I am God." So Arjuna is not like that type of. Therefore he is speaking to Arjuna. He is devotee. In the Fourth Chapter also, He said, //bhakto 'si priyo 'si// [[books:bg:4:3|[Bg. 4.3]]]. Therefore Kṛṣṇa does not expose Himself unless one is devotee. This is first qualification. So to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// one must be a devotee. The so-called //jñānī, yogī,// they cannot understand. It is not possible, because they are trying to become God. Although it is simply dream, they can never become, but they are envious, that "Why Kṛṣṇa should be God? I have got so many gods." //Anasūyave.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Rāja-vidya rāja-guhyaṁ pavitram idam uttamam pratyakṣa...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Avagamam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//...avagamaṁ dharmyaṁ su-sukhaṁ kartum avyayam// [[books:bg:9:2|[Bg. 9.2]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And the //bhakti-yoga...// This is //bhakti-yoga.// Therefore it is //rāja-vidya;// when all kinds of learning, it is the king of.

**Chandobhai:**
King of all.

**Dr. Patel:**
King of. Is coming up.

**Prabhupāda:**
So //rāja-vidya// and //rāja-guhyam:// most confident, very secret. It is not... And //pavitram, uttamam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Pratyakṣa avagamam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
And //pratyakṣa avagamaṁ dharmyam.// If you are //jñānī, karmī, yogī,// you cannot immediately directly perceive whether actually you have got the thing. But //bhakti-yoga// is like that.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Su-sukhaṁ. Kartum avyayam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhakti-yoga,// if you perform, you will perceive that "Yes, I am in this stage. I am in this stage." That has been described by Rūpa Gosvāmī. Just like when you are hungry and you are eating something, you can understand... [aside:] Don't come very near. You can understand that how much satisfaction you have got by eating. You haven't got to ask anybody, "Whether I am eating?" You can understand. The //bhakti-yoga// is so nice thing that if you execute it, you will understand your position. And it is //su-sukham.// To execute //bhakti-yoga,// there is no difficulty. It is always happy. Just like our program. Program is chant, dance, take //prasādam.// And if you take //yoga// system, //jñāna// system, first of all you have to become a very great, learned scholar, and then //yoga// system, you have to practice so many //āsanas,// press your nose, and so many things. But here everything is very happy: chant, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// dance and then take //prasādam,// and you understand where you are. This is the //su-sukham.// And //avyayam. Avyayam// means whatever little //bhakti-yoga// you have advanced, that is permanent.

**Dr. Patel:**

> dharmasyāsya parantapa
> aprāpya māṁ nivartante
> mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani
> [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. "And those who have no faith in //bhakti-yoga,// they do not get Me. They simply labor." That's all. //Śrama eva hi kevalam// [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]. They are wasting time. That's all. As soon as we say, the time wasters, they become angry, "Oh, why you are saying? Don't criticize others." But if we say... //Satya bole ta mare latha// [laughter] //suta jagalda.//[?] If you bluff, "Oh, you are doing very nice, you are doing very nice," oh, he will be very pleased. And if I say that "You rascal, you are doing all, simply wasting your time," he will not be... //Mūrkhāyopadeṣo hi prakopāya.//

**Dr. Patel:**

> jagad avyakta-mūrtinā
> mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni
> na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> na mat sthāni bhūtāni
> paśya me yogam aiśvaram
> bhūta-bhṛn na ca bhūta-stho
> mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ
> [[books:bg:9:5|[Bg. 9.5]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So this is His inconceivable potency. Everything is resting on Him. Without Him, there is nothing. Nothing can exist. Still, the same argument comes again, that because the dog or the anything is resting on me, it does not mean I am dog. //Daridra,// he is resting on me, that does not mean I am //daridra.// Yes. This is the... This is wrong conception, misleading people. This kind of coined word, simply misleading people.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Na ca mat-sthāni bhūtāni.// Even though He says...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I have nothing to do with //daridra.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Therefore He said //mat-sthāni bhūtāni.//

**Prabhupāda:**
He is suffering of his own //karma.//

**Dr. Patel:**
But here a little difficulty for me. Here on the first line He says, //mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. Second line He says, //na ca mat-sthāni bhūtāni paśya me yogam aiśvaram.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. Therefore, //na ca mat-sthāni:// "Although I am there, I am not there." That is inconceivable, simultaneously not also, just to warn these people that although Nārāyaṇa is within the //daridra,// in the dog, that does not mean "I am dog or I am //daridra.//"

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhūta-bhṛn na ca bhūta-stho mamātmā bhūta-bhāvanaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhūta-stha bhūta-bhāvanaḥ:// "Everything is coming from Me. I am also within that, but still..." It is called //acintya-bhedābheda,// that "I am there; I am not there."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Yathākāśa-sthito nityaṁ vāyuḥ sarvatra-go mahān.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, this is the example.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Tathā sarvāṇi bhūtāni mat-sthānīty upadhāraya// [[books:bg:9:6|[Bg. 9.6]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Just like this cloud. The cloud, we say "In the sky." The cloud is not in the sky; it is on the air. They mistake this, that "Nārāyaṇa is there." Nārāyaṇa is not there. Nārāyaṇa is separate. That is their foolishness.

**Dr. Patel:**

> sarva-bhūtāni kaunteya
> prakṛtiṁ yānti māmikām
> kalpa-kṣaye punas tāni
> kalpādau visṛjāmy aham
> [[books:bg:9:7|[Bg. 9.7]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because everything is coming from Him. //Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante.// Again they are given a chance to prosecute the result of his //karma.// And there is chance also to become a devotee. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, by His confidential servant, He preaches, "Take to this." But if they do not take, then again //kalpa-kṣaye,// again enters.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kalpādau visṛjāmy aham.//

**Prabhupāda:**
And again there is //kalpa.// Again they come out. In this way they do not become liberated. Just like the child, those who are being, what is called, contraceptive method, abortion. These are very sinful. Because they have done killing, so they enter into the mother's womb and they are again killed, and again enter into the mother's womb, and again killed. He does not see the light. Similarly, those who are sinful, they are given chance in material manifestation, "Now work for Kṛṣṇa consciousness." But they do not do that. Again enters, again come out. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. This is going on. How much they are wasting their time, not taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Dr. Patel:**

> visṛjāmi punaḥ punaḥ
> bhūta-grāmam imaṁ kṛtsnam
> avaśaṁ prakṛter vaśāt
> [[books:bg:9:8|[Bg. 9.8]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now //visṛjāmi.// The God, He creates. Here they comes. The rascals, they do not believe it, that "There is no creator." The Jains, they do not believe it, that creator has done it. "It has come automatically." Buddhist philosophy is like that, that "Everything is coming by combination..."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Prakṛti// and //puruṣa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is wrong theory. Actually, He says //visṛjāmi, ahaṁ visṛjāmi:// "I do."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Prakṛtiṁ svām avaṣṭabhya:// "Controlling my //prakṛti.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
//Avaṣṭabhya,// now entering.

**Dr. Patel:**
"Entering into My //prakṛti,// I am //sṛjāmi, punaḥ punaḥ.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. He is outside; He is inside.

**Indian:**
And then leave it in the control of the //prakṛti, prakṛter vaśāt, avaṣaṁ prakṛter vaṣāt. Bhūta-grāmam imaṁ kṛtsnam avaṣām prakṛter vaśāt.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhūta-grāmam,// not He.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhūta-grāmam,// is due to the //prakṛti,// after creating the //bhūtas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**

> nibadhnanti dhanañjaya
> udāsīna-vad āsīnam
> asaktaṁ teṣu karmasu
> [[books:bg:9:9|[Bg. 9.9]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The same thing, that just like a judge orders, "This man should be hanged." But the judge is not affected by such thing. He's not affected. Just like you surgical, you are going on surgical operation. You are not affected. The man is crying, "Oh, here, doctor, you are killing me, killing me, killing me." But the killing or not killing, doctor //sāhīb// is not interested.

**Dr. Patel:**

> sūyate sa-carācaram
> hetunānena kaunteya

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is the... These rascal atheist class, they think that //prakṛti// is creating, //prakṛti// is creating, that the ocean is created by //prakṛti.// But why the ocean does not come here, fifty, sixty years. Because there is order that "You cannot come here." This big ocean, immediately, in one minute, it can swallow up whole Bombay. Therefore it is controlled. It is controlled by the Supreme. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa.//

**Dr. Patel:**

> mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ
> sūyate sa-carācaram
> hetunānena kaunteya
> jagad viparivartate
> [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
The whole worldly affair is going on... The godless atheists, they cannot understand it, that behind this //prakṛti,// the wonderful //prakṛti,// so many things happening. It is not happening independently.

**Dr. Patel:**
By the order of God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa:// "Under My control."

**Dr. Patel:**

> avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā
> mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam
> paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto
> mama bhūta-maheśvaram
> [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, these //mūḍhas,// they will think, "Huh? It is controlled by Kṛṣṇa? Huh. He is ordinary man like this." A //mūḍha. Paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto.// He does not know how much powerful is Kṛṣṇa, the //mūḍha.//

**Dr. Patel:**
But you see, this is not like this, that those fools... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is also another //mūḍha.// But suppose if Kṛṣṇa says that "I am controlling the whole universe," the //mūḍha// will not believe it. "Huh? How is that? How...? Such a big, gigantic //prakṛti,// and He is a person, He can control?" The //mūḍha// cannot understand. He cannot understand that how much powerful is Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ maheśvaram.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ.// They do not know what is the all-omniscient nature of Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
The spiritual power of His. No. //Paraṁ bhāva? Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ// [[books:bg:9:12|[Bg. 9.12]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore, as soon as these rascal, they get little power, yogic perfection, they think, "I have become God. I have become God."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ.// [laughing]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Rascal, he thinks that because "I can make like this, little gold, therefore I have become God."

**Dr. Patel:**
Because they can go to moon...

**Prabhupāda:**
The rascal does not think that "I am making, say, two grains or five grains of gold, but one who has made gold mines, millions, so He will be God or I will be God?" The rascal does not think that. And other rascals follow, "Oh, here is God. Here is God. He is creating gold." You see? Therefore //mūḍha.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ// [[books:bg:9:12|[Bg. 9.12]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, //moghāśā.// They are thinking that "I will become like this, I will become like this." //Karmīs// are thinking like this, //jñānīs// are thinking like this, //yogīs// are... But they are all false, //mūḍhas. Moghāśā.// Their hope will be frustrated. //Moghāśā. Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo// [[books:bg:9:12|[Bg. 9.12]]]. //Mogha// means frustration. //Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo// [[books:bg:9:12|[Bg. 9.12]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
//Rākṣasīm āsurīṁ caiva prakṛtiṁ mohinīṁ aśritāḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Mohinīm.// They are that //aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ. Arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ anādhṛta-yusmad-aṅghrayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. They are all impure. Their intelligence is not purified.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Now... Now here come in the... These people are //moghāśā, moghāśā.// Their all hopes will be frustrated. But another class, //mahātmā. Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. They take shelter of the spiritual energy. //Daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ.// Because they..., the symptom is //bhajanty ananya manasaḥ,// "Hare Kṛṣṇa." They are not captivated by the so-called //jñānīs, yogīs, karmīs.// No. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is //mahātmā.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:14|[Bg. 9.14]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Again explained. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto.// That is their only business.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā nitya-yuktā upāsate.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is being done in every ISKCON center. //Satataṁ kīrtayanto,// chanting always "Kṛṣṇa," //namasyantas,// offering obeisances. Everything in Kṛṣṇa. This is //mahātmā.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes.

Here difficulty [Hindi].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Difficult [Hindi]. The //jñāna-yajña// [Hindi]. Indirectly. They are //bhajante mām,// but in a different way. And the //mahātmās,// those who are //bhaktas,// they are directly in the way. And they are indirectly, in this way.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ekatvena pṛthaktvena bahudhā viśvato-mukham.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. //Ekatvena:// "Now, I am, I am God."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Pṛthaktvena. Bahudhā viśvato-mukham.// [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Pantheism, pantheism. //Bahudhā. Bahudhā// means God has become pantheism.

**Dr. Patel:**
All this.

"Everything is I." Because it is His energy, therefore He is. //Śakti-śaktimator abhedaḥ.// The energy and the energetic, they are identical.

He is //sat// and //asat// both.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cause and effect.

**Dr. Patel:**
Cause and effect. Now comes about the //brāhmaṇa// class who are making the //yajñas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Svar-gatim,// those who are desiring to go to the Svargaloka, heavenly planet, they go. They go...

**Dr. Patel:**
And come back.

**Prabhupāda:**

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. The devotees, they do not care for anybody. Simply depending on Kṛṣṇa. Therefore whatever necessities they require, Kṛṣṇa will supply.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ye 'py anya-devatā-bhaktā yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ.// [Hindi] //Te 'pi mām eva kaunteya yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam// [[books:bg:9:23|[Bg. 9.23]]]. //Ahaṁ hi sarva-yajñānāṁ bhoktā ca prabhur eva ca, na tu mām abhijānanti tattva...// [[books:bg:9:24|[Bg. 9.24]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He is performing //yajña.// Just like the yajñic //brāhmaṇa// in Vṛndāvana. Kṛṣṇa went there and asked for some food. "Heh!"

**Dr. Patel:**
They did not give.

**Prabhupāda:**
They did not give.

**Dr. Patel:**
Their wives gave.

**Prabhupāda:**
All yajñic //brāhmaṇas,// like that. There are so many fools like that. They are thinking that "I am..., we are doing //yajñas,// I am doing this, I am doing that. What is this Kṛṣṇa? The Kṛṣṇa devotees are less intelligent. They are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa."

**Dr. Patel:**

> bhoktā ca prabhur eva ca
> na tu mām abhijānanti
> tattvenātaś cyavanti te
> [[books:bg:9:24|[Bg. 9.24]]]

Because they fall from the truth.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because these people do not understand Kṛṣṇa //tattvata,// therefore they fall down.

**Dr. Patel:**

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtāni yānti bhūtejyā
> yānti mad-yājino 'pi mām
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes. "Now, the //devayājas,// they can go to the heavenly planet. //Pitṛs// and //śraddhā// performer, they go Pitṛloka. //Bhūtejyā,// those who are worshiping this material world, they remain here. But if one worships Me, he comes to Me."

**Dr. Patel:**
"Come to Me in Goloka Vṛndāvana".

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everything is open, but an intelligent person will think that "Why shall I go to Svargaloka? Why shall I remain here? Why shall I go to Pitṛloka? Let me go direct to Kṛṣṇa." //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. That is intelligent, to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, to take to Kṛṣṇa wholeheartedly. That is real intelligence. Otherwise //mūḍha,// whatever he may be.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. And to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, it does not require any expensive material. If you have nothing to offer, you can offer //patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ.// He will be satisfied. And performing this //yajña// and other, oh, you have got to collect so much //ghee,// so much grain, so much //mantras,// so many learned //brāhmaṇas// and this and that. You have nothing to do. Anywhere, any part of the world, universal, any man, poor man, rich man, can offer Kṛṣṇa whatever he has got, Kṛṣṇa is satisfied.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. //Bhaktya-upahṛtam aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ.// Yes. "Because he has offered Me with faith and devotion and love, I accept it." So when Kṛṣṇa eats something from your hand, then what remains? Again perfection. All perfection is there. If Kṛṣṇa is accepting something from your hand, "Yes, I will eat it." Then?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam.// Therefore this is //bhakti-yoga.// Whatever you do, the result you give to Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
Whatever you do for Him, and forget about it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Unless you do for Him, how you can give it? Because you are thinking that "I am doing for me," therefore you do not give to Kṛṣṇa. You keep it in your pocket.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Śubhāśubha-phalair evaṁ mokṣyase karma-bandhanaiḥ// [[books:bg:9:28|[Bg. 9.28]]]. Ah, //yat tapasyasi kaunteya tad kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam// [[books:bg:9:27|[Bg. 9.27]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Tapasi, tapasya.// There are many, they are very much addicted to //tapasya, suska tapasya. Śūṣka tapasya.// There are many stages---unnecessarily starving, fasting unnecessarily.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Karṣanti mām.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Yes. This is going on. Why? Take Kṛṣṇa //prasādam,// be happy, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// and dance. //Susukhaṁ kartum avyayam// [[books:bg:9:2|[Bg. 9.2]]]. Everything very nice to perform and very progressive, immediately.

//Nyāsa// means giving up, giving up. //Nyāsa. Sat nyāsa, sannyāsa. Oṁ tat sat. Sat// is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore when you sacrifice everything for Kṛṣṇa, that is real //sannyāsa,// not this dress. This dress is symbolical. That's all. Real thing is //kāryaṁ karma karoti ya. Kāryam.// "Oh, it is my... Kṛṣṇa wants everyone should surrender unto Him. Then I shall teach everyone to surrender to Kṛṣṇa." //Kāryam.// "This is my business." //Kāryaṁ karma karoti, sa sannyāsī.// What is that //kāryam? Kāryam// means... This is //kāryam.//

**Chandobhai:**
//Yajñā dana tapa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. You'll take a practical. My Guru Mahārāja gave me hint that "Book publication is more pleasing to me than //maṭha-mandira.//" So I took it, and I began to publish books, and that has come successful. //Kāryaṁ karma.// I took it, "Oh, Guru Mahārāja wants that books should be published. So let me concentrate on this instead of..." My creating so many centers, big, big temples, that is not my primary duty. My primary duty is to write books. Therefore I am going on still. These are coming automatically. Maybe this is the secret of my success.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Sannyāsa-yoga-yuktātmā vimukto mām upaiṣyasi// [[books:bg:9:28|[Bg. 9.28]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, //karyam,// that one should take the order of the //guru,// because //guru// is the representative of Kṛṣṇa. So when one takes... That is explained by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura in connection with the verse,

> vyavasāyātmikā buddhir
> ekeha kuru-nandana
> bahu-śākhā hy anantāś ca
> buddhayo 'vyavasāyinām
> [[books:bg:2:41|[Bg. 2.41]]]

So the //vyavasāyīs,// those who are fixed up in the words of //guru,// so "//Guru// has ordered me to do it. Oh, that is my life. I do not know whether I will be promoted to heaven or hell. It doesn't matter. I shall execute."

**Dr. Patel:**
Execute the order of the //guru.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Guru.// Yes. That is the secret. //Yasya deve parā bhaktir tathā deve yathā gurau// [//ŚU// 6.23]. Then he is sure to be successful. This is the secret.

**Dr. Patel:**

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. They //bhajanti,// and these rascals has announced, "This //bhajana// is nuisance." Just see. This is Kali-yuga, and this is our Indian government. //Ye bhajanti māṁ teṣam.// He is always associating with God. "I am always with him," //ye bhajanti,// and this rascal has remarked, "//Bhajana// nuisance." //Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna.// These are the statements. But we are... We did not take any...

**Dr. Patel:**
They are //durācaris.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. But we should have taken some step against this, the "Why you have said like this?" But nobody has taken.

**Dr. Patel:**
But we are going to take steps. Let that man come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Here... The first thing is one must have rigid, staunch faith in Kṛṣṇa. That is the qualification. Other things may be little deviation. It doesn't matter. The first thing is whether he is sticking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then he is //sādhu.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ananya-bhāk.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ananya-bhāk,// yes. He has no other business.

**Dr. Patel:**
Because he is //samyag vyavasito,// he is rightly doing.

**Prabhupāda:**
"Although there are some bad habits," //kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ,// "because he is My devotee, he will not be lost. He will take to the right position."

**Dr. Patel:**
I'll read this twice, and twice we are...

> kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā
> śaśvac-chāntiṁ nigacchati
> kaunteya pratijānīhi
> na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Chandobhai:**
He has made a promise.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Kaunteya pratijānīhi.// He has not promised; He says Arjuna, that "You declare this." Because sometimes for His devotee He breaks His promise. But because His devotee Arjuna will promise, it will be never frustrated. "Oh, My devotee has promised." Therefore He says, //kaunteya pratijānīhi,// "You do this."

**Dr. Patel:**

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the conclusion, //bhajasva mām.// Again //bhajana.//

**Dr. Patel:**
The highest... That is why we have come here.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhajasva mām.// Again He's saying, //bhajasva mām.//

**Dr. Patel:**
The highest comes now.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the highest...

**Dr. Patel:**
Highest comes now.

**Prabhupāda:**
You know, while commenting this verse, Dr. Radhakrishnan, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa." Just see. After reading so much he said, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa." Just see. //Mūḍha.// [laughs] There is a Bengali proverb, //sat-khanda rāmāyaṇa pāde, sitera na baba//[?]. After reading the seven //khandas...//

**Indian man:**
Yes, he's Bengali.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's all right. After reading the whole Rāmāyaṇa he is asking, "Whose father is Sītā?" Similarly, this Dr. Radhakrishnan, after reading the whole chapter, he is advising, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa." Just see how much rascal he is. And he is passing on as a great scholar.

**Dr. Patel:**
I will re-read this three times. I will read this three times. //Man-mana bhava-mad-bhakto.// [goes on reading verse]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the conclusion.

**Dr. Patel:**
"When completely yourself are settled in Me, you have got to come to Me. You can't go anywhere else." Again I will read the last. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Very simple thing. You always think of Kṛṣṇa, //man-manā;// you become His devotee, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto; mad-yājī,// worship Kṛṣṇa, and //namaskuru.// Where is the cost? No expenditure. If you think of Kṛṣṇa, if you worship Kṛṣṇa, if you offer obeisances to Him... Therefore this Deity is there, for these purposes. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Simply by doing these four things, he is becoming liberated so much that he is going back to Godhead. That's all.

[break] ...movement is very scientific movement, based on the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Most scientific. [break] We may be proud. Because this is scientific, therefore it is so quickly progressing. [break] ...take. Within one cult. [break] ...so I was, that "I want to start this movement," I was talking. So he very much appreciated, and he promised in writing that "As soon as I retire I shall join with you." He wrote me.

**Dr. Patel:**
But then we have to tell him that "Come on, you are retiring. Join. And if you..."

**Prabhupāda:**
That I wrote also. He was silent.

**Dr. Patel:**
Now, you just tell him, "If you are following me here, there is one Dr. Patel who will take you." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...come for treatment. Why shall I come? [break] ...eight years old..., older than me. So I am seventy-eight. Maybe eighty-six. Yes. He was also of the same age. Older than me.

**Dr. Patel:**
You were all the time in Allahabad. You must be knowing them from very close part.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he my customer. I used to go to his home. And he was coming to my shop. Yes. He was my customer. When 1928 Congress was there, I sent him one letter that "I want to become a delegate and go there." So immediately, "Yes, you come." So I went to Calcutta and I told his secretary that "Panditji has told me like this." "Yes, take this ticket." Yes. I became... So I was criticizing my friend, because the delegate fee is one rupee and the reception committee fee at that time was twenty-five rupees. And still, they were on the last seat. And because at that time Motilal Nehru became president, the president..., the province in which the president becomes, that provincial member occupies the first seat. So we occupied the first seat from Allahabad. So I...

**Dr. Patel:**
Front seats.

**Prabhupāda:**
Front seat, yes. So I was criticizing my friends in Calcutta that "You have paid twenty-five rupees, you have got last seat. I have paid one rupee, I have first seat." We were very thickly... Not very thickly, but as customer... Do you know? I shall tell one incident. One day Jawaharlal Nehru came and he asked me, "Give me prophylactic hairbrush." So I told, "Panditji, we are selling prophylactic toothbrush, and we do not know that there is prophylactic hairbrush." "No, you do not know. You get it for me. I want it." So I got it from Bombay, here, and supplied him.

**Dr. Patel:**
There is no prophylactic hairbrush anywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I got it, prophylactic hairbrush.

**Dr. Patel:**
Somebody writes on it, on the name "prophylactic."

**Prabhupāda:**
It may be whatever it may be. Now, just see that how much country conscious he was: he wants a tooth brush. Not only that. I will tell you another incident. I was manufacturing one medicine, //jagon[?]// poultice. That is like anti-[indistinct]. So doctors were prescribing in Allahabad. So there was one big doctor, Dr. R. N. Banerjee, Rai Baba. So sometimes I was seeing the doctors. So when I went there, "Oh, it is very difficult to prescribe country medicine." "Why?" "Oh, you will be surprised. I prescribed this //jagon// poultice in the Nehru family." He was physician. "And Motilal Nehru said, 'Oh, doctor, excuse me. In the matter of medicine, don't prescribe country medicine.' " Just see. Believed in him.

**Dr. Patel:**
Gandhiji was never asking anything for medicine much.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is another thing. I know these people, this Nehru family. They were completely Europeanized. Outwardly [indistinct]. Even up to the last point of his life, if some European would come, he would immediately receive him. And if you Indian wants to see him, "Oh, it will be..." You will have to wait at least one...

**Dr. Patel:**
He was conscious about the color.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everything London-made is very good. That was Jawaharlal Nehru's idea.

**Dr. Patel:**
Totally. Absolutely. It was a miracle, I think, the greatest miracle Calcutta has ever had.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He was... From very beginning of his birth, he is Englishman.

**Dr. Patel:**
Right. He was not allowed to speak Bengali by his parents.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Dr. Patel:**
He was not allowed talking Bengali by his parents

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. And because in those days... [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
We are forgetting Sanskrit very quickly.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, those who are interested...

**Dr. Patel:**
Now the schools, they don't teach as in our times. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
As soon as the //kṣatriyas// were negligent, immediately the //brāhmaṇas// should take step. That was the system.

[break] ...offer advice to the //kṣatriyas// according to //śāstra,// and //kṣatriyas// would execute, and the //vaiśyas// would care for supply. And the //śūdras,// serving everyone. That's all. This is the system. [break] So he used to manufacture. To manufacture means //śūdra.//

**Dr. Patel:**
I see. [end]
