====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...find out wine and woman. That's all.

**Girirāja:**
[reading from //Kṛṣṇa// book] "While they were thus enjoying themselves..."

**Prabhupāda:**
But in America I don't think there is such thing.

**Dr. Patel:**
Because, these nightclubs and all these things is of this type.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
Sex, merriment. I have not seen a single nightclub, though I studied in England for two years. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Nārada, but still they are sinful. Such a great personality like Nārada they have seen, but still they are sinful. Go on.

**Girirāja:**
"As such, the great sage Nārada considered that because the demigods Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva were so infatuated by false prestige, they should be put in a condition of life devoid of opulence." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...bench, standing. The small children, they are punished, "Stand up on the bench." It is like that.

**Dr. Patel:**
All vegetables are in //tamas,// in //tamas// [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Some of them, fruitful, those trees for supplying nice fruits, nice flowers, they are in the goodness. Everywhere the three qualities are working.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
There may be dog in the mode of goodness?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, dog is an animal. He is in the ignorance. But the cow is in goodness. //Sattva-raja-tamo.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Horse is in //rajas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Horse, lions. The monkey is in //tamas.//

**Dr. Patel:**
And animal is in //tamas// and //rajas...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything, there are three qualities, everywhere.

**Dr. Patel:**
Everywhere. But more //rajas// is in monkeys, because they are more active. These particular... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They are researching for something which is useless. Therefore //tamas. Rajas-tamo-bhavaḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. This is the effect of //rajas-tamas: kāma// and //lobha,// greedy and always hankering after.

**Dr. Patel:**
But sometimes real scientists speak out the truth. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't give pain to others.

**Dr. Patel:**
Don't give...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Others, painful condition. If you feel pain by certain condition, that is...

**Dr. Patel:**
//Ātmavat sarva bhūteṣu.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Girirāja:**
"Generally it is seen that one who has risen from a poverty-stricken life and becomes wealthy creates some charitable institution at the end of his life..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...goes to market and gets some this... What is called, //bhūta, bhūta?//

**Dr. Patel:**
What is, //bhūta,//

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Corns.

**Prabhupāda:**
Corns. [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
Corn, or this...

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
//Mottai//[?]? [indistinct]

**Dr. Patel:**
But that is why I say that //rasanā// [tongue] is not so strong as //śiṣṇa// [genital].

**Prabhupāda:**
No, if you do not allow //rasanā// to enjoy much, //śiṣṇa// will be subdued.

**Dr. Patel:**
But still, I mean personally, for myself, I don't have any taste for any food. In fact I have been taking all the food together just like the //sannyāsīs,// and I don't have any taste. But still I have from within me I don't find that form of sex carrying out, though I am a scientist.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to say that "Sex life is so strong that even if I see one wooden female form I become excited."

**Dr. Patel:**
That is why I feel the same thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So this is not unnatural. Caitanya Mahāprabhu tells this because this cannot be avoided. But by knowledge it can be avoided.

**Dr. Patel:**
We were talking the same thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, by knowledge. Yes. But "Because I am excited, therefore I have to do this," that is not good.

**Dr. Patel:**
But then I found out the solution for this. As soon as you feel excitement... [break] Then you have nothing to do with it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore knowledge.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes. That I have started practicing this for some time. And I feel a great solace in that.

**Prabhupāda:**
That has been recommended by Śaṅkarācārya, that "Why you are attracted by these forms? It is only a combination of flesh and marrow. That's all."

**Dr. Patel:**
No, but who is attracted? The //indriya// is attracted. I am beyond //indriya.// That also you think. I am master of the //indriya.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So long we are associated... The example I have given many times, that I am sitting on a car, and the car there is accident. I am not car. Still, I am excited, "Oh, my car is lost. Why you have struck my car?" There is so much quarrel. But it is a fact, he knows that "I am not the car." That is called //abhiniveśa.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Wrong orientation.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, //matṛvat para-dareṣu:// "Always think of other's wife as mother."

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mātṛvat...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...also have to die.

**Dr. Patel:**
We die, don't mind, but we want others to die as Muslims. We want to die them as Hindus. [break] ...supersonic soundness.

**Prabhupāda:**
Supersonic? What is that? Any circumstance, the ruling power is nature. He cannot avoid that. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. [break] ...more their senses are turbulent. This is also... Therefore there is one //tapasā brahmacāryena// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]], and the word //anaśana, anaśana,// "not eating." Eating should be reduced.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Tapasā brahmacāryena damena...// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...yamena, damena.// There are so many. Out of that, there is one, //anaśana, anaśana,// not eating.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Anaśana. Ana-asana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break]

**Girirāja:**
"...not very turbulent, he cannot become violent." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...yuktāhāra.// Not to eat more, not to eat less. That is required. [break] ...yes, when I was alone in Baroda, I was making my customers for //Back to Godhead.// So I entered one gentleman's house, and from the porch he was, "Don't come! Don't come! Don't come!" (laughs] Immediately.

**Dr. Patel:**
Baroda was a very small place then. [indistinct] place. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...if I go to a place, //jataji bhikṣā dijiye,// so everyone will be compassionate. And it is our duty, at least in Vedic civilization, that when a //sannyāsī// comes he is received: "//Aiye, aiye,// Mahārāja, //betiye.//" Still. Still in the villages they do that. Just like it is mentioned in the //śāstra// that //brahmacārī// and //sannyāsīs// should be taken as the sons of the society.

**Dr. Patel:**
In Poona, even today in Poona... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They are trained like that, very good. [break] It is compulsory that every man should become a mendicant for some time.

**Indian man (1):**
They must have experience of that. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...there is a temple, Tarakeśvara, in Hoogli district. So Lord Śiva... So people, I mean to say, pray that "If my this disease is cured" or "If I get this victory, I shall become a //sannyāsī// for a month." [laughs] So that system is going on. They become //sannyāsīs// for one month. There are hundreds and thousands.

**Dr. Patel:**
They, according to our Hindu... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is called "one-month //sannyāsī.//" That is not mentioned in the //śāstra,// but it has come into custom.

**Dr. Patel:**
Custom. But according to //śāstra...// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...and if he returns, he is called //vāntāśī,// yes, "eating the vomit."

**Indian man (1):**
Before giving //sannyāsa,// the teacher will take proper care that his mind is already peaceful and all... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...obeisances, we take out our shoes. That is a system.

**Indian man (1):**
Even the hat...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hat, yes. [break] ...naked is not civilization. It is not civilization.

**Dr. Patel:**
That means practice //tapas// right from the beginning of your days... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The body is changed.

**Dr. Patel:**
It's not //icchā-dveṣa samutthena dvandva-mohena// [[books:bg:7:27|[Bg. 7.27]]]? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
That past life, because the body is changed, you forget.

**Dr. Patel:**
Some of the people also...

**Prabhupāda:**
Some of the...

**Dr. Patel:**
I don't know how it is. It is difficult to explain.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is special. That is special.

**Dr. Patel:**
There is a big research going on in the parapsychology here in India and America.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is by the grace of God one can remember about his past life. [break] ...practical experience. In our family, my mother's eldest sister, her son of a previous birth came to see her. Old man, very old man. [break] This is called illusion.

**Dr. Patel:**
All relations of the son, child, wife, husband, all these are of the... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...just like in the river sometimes several straws will meet together...

**Dr. Patel:**
[indistinct Sanskrit]

**Prabhupāda:**
...and again they disperse. [break] We get our body and mix together, and again we are dispersed by the waves of time. [break] ...at the end we shall see Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Girirāja:**
“ '...the original Personality of Godhead, master of all mystic powers, learned //brāhmaṇas// know very well that this cosmic manifestation is an expansion of Your potency.' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...and Nalakūvara, but He remained bound up.

**Indian man (1):**
About His //līlā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] Yaśodāmāyī is more powerful than Kṛṣṇa. Eh?

**Indian man (1):**
No, devotees are more powerful always.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] Just see. He liberated Nalakūvara, but He remained bound up by the rope of Yaśodāmāyī. [break] ...children. [break] ...some conjugal love.

**Dr. Patel:**
Then He became eight years old. How could any //gopī// have a conjugal love with a boy of seven or eight years?

**Indian man (1):**
Spiritual love.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not this love. That is a different love.

**Dr. Patel:**
Conjugal love is //mādhurya-rāsa.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mādhurya-rāsa,// yes... [break] ...eat along with my father. Yes. Unless I come, father will not...

**Dr. Patel:**
But you were brought up in a big city, but I was brought up in a small village. Actually... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The same. It doesn't matter whether it is in the village or town.

**Dr. Patel:**
In the villages we eat more. We used to buy [Hindi]... [break] [end]
