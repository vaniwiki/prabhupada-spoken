====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//...cetasā nānya-gāminā.// One has to practice. [break] It will take some time.

[break] //...yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā.// One has to practice. That means his determination is not yet fixed up. Because he is very rich, he is thinking that "This is all right." That is another defect of becoming very much rich. //Bhogaiśvarya prasaktānāṁ tayā upahṛta-cetasām// [[books:bg:2:44|[Bg. 2.44]]]: "Those who are too much attached to this material enjoyment and..., by which his consciousness is bewildered..." All these defects are there because he is too much attached to material enjoyment. [break] Why don't you give him dress if he has no dress? This is not good. You have not marked it?

**Girirāja:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then what is this? He's... Give him dress.

**Girirāja:**
[indistinct aside] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Give him lesson how to make //tilaka.// He has come to your shelter. You teach him. [break] Just like a diseased person, if he is a little careless, he is not very strict in following the..., it will take some time. It is exactly like that. He, because of his material opulences, he thinks that "Oh, where is the disease? This is all right. I am happy." That is the defect. We have to reduce. That is called //tapasya.// Not that "Because my tongue is asking me to eat something, therefore I must eat." Not that. That is the difference between ordinary man and //gosvāmī. Gosvāmī// means one who has conquered over the dictation of the senses. My sense dictates to do something, but when I am able to dictate the sense, "No, you cannot do it," that is called //gosvāmī.//

[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
...maybe an African or Indian?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Indian.

**Dr. Patel:**
African, after all. Americans must be first. [wind interference---indistinct] ...some politically conscious Africans.

**Prabhupāda:**
We have got about ten African devotees now in our Nairobi branch.

[break] ...attached to material sense enjoyment. Such person cannot take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

[break] ...avoid the dictation of the senses. But when a man is able to dictate the senses, then he is //gosvāmī.//

**Dr. Patel:**
That is...?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Gosvāmī.//

**Dr. Patel:**
"One who is lord of //go,// senses."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, senses. In that stage he cannot give up. //Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartante.// When one sees that "This is better quality than the other," then he takes. Unless... Because superficially... Suppose for becoming Vaiṣṇava he has to undergo so many austerities. So ordinary man cannot find out that this is better life than that. So when he understands, "This service is not good. To serve Kṛṣṇa is good," then he can give up the service of //māyā. Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 2.59]]]. Just like an ordinary servant, he is serving in your house, but if he gets some more salary in other's house, he gives it up. That is required. //Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate.//

**Girirāja:**
[reading from //Kṛṣṇa// book] "This //māyā,// or illusory struggle for existence, is immediately stopped. Lord Brahmā, who has full control over the goddess of learning and who is considered to be the best authority in Vedic knowledge, was thus perplexed, being unable to understand the extraordinary power manifested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ. Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. [break] ...said that unless one comes to understand the inconceivable power of God, there is no meaning of God.

**Dr. Patel:**
It is impossible to conceive God.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, inconceivable power of God. God is in your presence.

**Dr. Patel:**
No, no, but His personal power is inconceivable. Nobody understands His power. Power is... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...understand the inconceivable power of God. [break] First of all he has to come to the //sattva-guṇa. Sthitaḥ sattve prasīdati.//

> tato rājas-tamo-bhāvāḥ
> kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye
> ceta etair anāvidhaṁ
> sthitaḥ sattve prasīdati
> [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]

When one becomes free from the //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// the symptom is... //Rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa// means lust and greediness. So when this //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa// is absent, then the //sattva-guṇa// becomes prominent. Every //guṇa// is there. //Tato rajas-tamo-bhavaḥ kama-lobhadayas ca ye, ceta etair...// The consciousness does not become infected by the resultant action of //tamo-guṇa// and //rajo-guṇa.// Then the only //sattva-guṇa// remains. So when one is situated in //sattva-guṇa, sthitaḥ sattve prasīdati,// then he becomes jubilant, //prasīdati.// That is //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. So one has to overcome the jurisdiction of //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa.// At the present moment the whole world is covered mostly by //tamo-guṇa// and little by //rajo-guṇa.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Americans have more by //rajo-guṇa.// They are creating and creating and creating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
We are by more //tamas.// They are indolent, don't want to work. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone makes this mistake [indistinct]. So as he is accepting, as Arjuna accepted, this is //paramparā// acceptance. [break]

**Girirāja:**
“ '...the material luminaries, Your transcendental effulgence is identical with //brahma-jyotir.//' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...advised, and all the //ācāryas// advised, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's advised. Why should we go somewhere else? Take shelter of His lotus feet. That's all. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is right conclusion. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. [break] //...mahātmā,// immediately by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. Immediately. [break] A child, if he is informed, "God is everywhere," he will never understand what is God. He knows that God is there, that this God consciousness is there. So what is the use of educating him, "Oh, God is everywhere. You don't require to go to temple"? This is nonsense. It is //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī.// He must know, "Here is God." He goes there, offer respect. All the children come. [break] ...a man, military man like Arjuna.

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes. Can he be a general?

**Prabhupāda:**
Mr. Sar.

**Mr. Sar:**
Arjuna, yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Arjuna was a very, very great general, the most ideal general of representing the real culture of this country.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is wanted. It doesn't matter. Nanda Mahārāja, a //vaiśya.// Arjuna is a //kṣatriya.// And there are many //śūdras// also. So what is that goat-//caṇḍāla.// He was a //caṇḍāla.// But everyone has got the right to become a devotee. That is wanted. [break] //...tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ// [SB 10.14.3]. Remain in your place, but giving aural reception to the Kṛṣṇa message, you become a devotee. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We don't ask anybody to change. We want to make him transcendental. //Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate// [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]. [break] //Brahma-stuta śruti-kārayan.// Now, in the //brahma-stuta, śruti-kārayan, brahma-stute, yaṁ brahma,// beginning... So that is //yaṁ brahma.// Then simply if you recite, //yaṁ brahma...// You must know who is that //yam.// And that is being explained by Kṛṣṇa. Here is that //yam:// Kṛṣṇa.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Vasudeva, bolo.//

**Child:**
[chants verse in Sanskrit]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Devakī ānandam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Kṛṣṇaṁ vande jagat guru.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yaṁ brahma-varuṇendra-rudraḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavaiḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. Sometimes the impersonalists argue, "If nobody has seen Him, then where is His form?" But here is. Brahmā, //yaṁ brahma.// Here is Brahmā is praying. So why you say nobody has seen? Brahmā has seen. Therefore he is offering.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bolo asitagirā samaṁsyāt.// He'll recite half a dozen.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's right. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Dr. Patel:**
He wants to study Sanskrit from now, when I read all those books. But his father has put him directly in English medium. It becomes very difficult. I have to take him out and now he can read Sanskrit. You can read.

**Prabhupāda:**
English medium, Sanskrit.

**Dr. Patel:**
English medium, the intelligence gets baffled, because it is not a mother language.

**Prabhupāda:**
Aurobindo Ghosh studied English from the very beginning.

**Dr. Patel:**
But he was extremely clever. He studied then Gujarati, not even Bengali. After he came from England...

**Prabhupāda:**
He came to Gujarati. No. He came to Baroda.

**Dr. Patel:**
Then he studied Gujarati, but he did not know Bengali at all. And then he came... [break] [Sanskrit] What is that? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...yam brahma vajanita//[?] From our childhood, if there was a rice grain on the floor, my father and my mother would ask me, "Take it and touch it on your head."

**Dr. Patel:**
Yes. We were advised not to tread on the grains. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Because by chance, if the grain is struck with the leg, she asked, "Take it and touch it on the head."

**Dr. Patel:**
That is the culture. [indistinct] culture.

**Prabhupāda:**
Means from the very beginning he understands //anna-brahma.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Even it is not spoken, you practice it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, practice it. According to Vedic culture, the higher class, in every home there is //nārāyaṇa-śilā// for worship, especially of the //brāhmaṇas.//

**Dr. Patel:**
In our homes we have all these small such temples, small chapels. All of us, our homes have got one room specially for Kṛṣṇa //mūrti// and [indistinct] For //pūjā// only. [break] We say //ṭhākura-ghara.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ṭhākura-ghara.// That //ṭhākura-ghara// must be there, not only simply a lavatory. There must be one //ṭhākura-ghara.//

**Dr. Patel:**
In all our homes. [end]
