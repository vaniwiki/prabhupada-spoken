====== Morning Walk, partially recorded ======

**Mahāṁsa:**
Pious people, they see that actually they are not giving any spiritual benefit by converting them into Christianity. So they are very against this. They want some original Vedic school, //gurukula// schools.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So that is, we have done already. Satsvarūpa has got practical experience. He can give you advice. He started this //gurukula.// Practically this //gurukula// I suggested, but he began. Yes. So you can take practical advice from him. [break]

**Mahāṁsa:**
I don't think we can start building until we finish this temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you can start in a cottage.

**Mahāṁsa:**
Yes, small way.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Mahāṁsa:**
And then develop.

**Prabhupāda:**
Building is not very important. Work is important. Activity is important. I started my movement not with buildings, but real activity. So building is opulence. But we can do without opulence. You can start anything, even underneath a tree. There is no difficulty. [break] They will allow our men?

**Mahāṁsa:**
I went. They did not ask any questions.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, there is no question of asking, but is there any hint from their side?

**Mahāṁsa:**
I have not heard that they, in Tirumala, they refuse foreigners.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah,

**Mahāṁsa:**
I have not heard that they have refused I have never heard any incident.

**Prabhupāda:**
that's all right. [//japa//] [break] So far reporters, they agreed that others have no right to...

**Mahāṁsa:**
Spread.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, to comment on this. [end]
