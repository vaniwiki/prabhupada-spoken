====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ//

**Devoee:**
//yoginaḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//yoginaḥ yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇā// [SB 12.13.1]. So the //brāhmaṇas,// although //sura,// he does not know Kṛṣṇa. //Yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇā.// The //asuras,// they do not know. Sometimes they... //Muhyanti yat surayaḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. So this was the test. Kṛṣṇa made a test, that "These //brāhmaṇas// are very much proud of their learning, Vedic knowledge. [break] They do not know Me." //Yatatām api siddhānām// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. Eh? //Yatatām api siddhānām.// They were //siddhas,// but they do not know Kṛṣṇa. Yes.

**Bhāgavata:**
They were not //śuddha-sāttvika.// They were only //sāttvika.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, on the //sāttvika.// Yes, you are right. One has to go above the //sāttvika// position, //śuddha-sattva. Sattvaṁ viśuddhaṁ vasudeva-śabditam// [[books:sb:4:3:23|[SB 4.3.23]]]. From Vasudeva conception, the Vāsudeva comes out.

**Dr. Patel:**
Now, after the //śuddha-sattva// form that you get...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is //vasudeva-sattva.//

**Dr. Patel:**
...then you are the real devotee.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
After that also, you go beyond all the three //guṇas.// Then you become... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...vasudeva-śabditam.// All right, go on.

**Girirāja:**
[reading //Kṛṣṇa// book] "When the boys saw that the //brāhmaṇas// would not speak to them, they became very disappointed. They then returned to Lord Kṛṣṇa..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...devotees of Kṛṣṇa becomes very much disappointed when one sees that the other one is not devotee of Kṛṣṇa.

**Girirāja:**
"They then returned to Lord Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma and explained everything that had happened. After hearing their statements, the Supreme Personality began to smile. He told them that they should not be sorry for being refused by the //brāhmaṇas.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
And this is the position of the preacher. Even if you are disappointed, you should not stop your preaching. You should go on with your business.

**Girirāja:**
"He told them that they should not be sorry for being refused by the //brāhmaṇas,// because that is the way of begging. He convinced them that while one is engaged in collecting or begging, one should not think that he will be successful everywhere. He may be unsuccessful in some places, but that should not be cause for disappointment." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...tama dāsa Ṭhākura has said, //karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa, sakale viṣera bhāṇḍa. Bhāṇḍa.// It is a pot of poison. //Karma-kāṇḍa, karma-kāṇḍa// process and the //jñāna-kāṇḍa// process, //karmīs// and the //jñānīs... Karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa, sakale viṣera bhāṇḍa:// "Both of them are poison pots." //Jñāna-kāṇḍa// also.

**Dr. Patel:**
But //jñāna,// you say, //bhakti// or //jñāna// automatically comes up.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, //bhakti// does not depend on //jñāna,// but //jñāna// depends on //bhakti.// Without //bhakti,// one cannot get liberation simply by //jñāna.// But if one develops //bhakti,// automatically he gets //jñāna. Karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa, sakale viṣera bhāṇḍa// [//Śrī Prema Bhakti-candrikā//]. The //viṣera bhāṇḍa, amṛta baliyā yebā khāya// [Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura]. If one mistakes that this is the pot of nectarean, ambrosia, then what is the result? //Nānā yoni brahman kare:// "He remains within the cycle of birth and death." //Nānā yoni brahman kare, kadarya bhakṣaṇa kare.// And if he gets the body of a hog and dog, then he eats all the abominable things. //Nānā yoni..., tāra janma adhah-pāte yāya.// So he condemns his human form of body in this way. Spoils. So one should not be attached to //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa. Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. [break] [end]
