====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
The inhabitants there, they can go from one planet to another without an aeroplane. That is Siddhaloka. Hmm. Go on.

**Dr. Patel:**
The highest is Satyaloka, no? Janaloka and Satyaloka.

**Prabhupāda:**
Brahmaloka.

**Dr. Patel:**
Brahmaloka, Janaloka and Satyaloka.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Highest Brahmaloka, where Lord Brahmā lives.

**Yaduvara:**
[reading] "There was beating of drums, and being inspired by godly feelings, the residents of Gandharvaloka began to play on their //tambūrās// to please the Lord. Once when He was..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...what is God. Such innocent. You see? They thought, "Might be some demigod." That's all.

**Yadubara:**
“ 'O Nanda Mahārāja, we are now in great doubt. Your son Kṛṣṇa must be one of the demigods.' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

**Yadubara:**
“ 'And He saved all honest men from the hands of the dishonest.' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Vṛndāvana inhabitants, they are always anxious how to save the cows. Always. They are connected with cows.

**Yadubara:**
"Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Twenty-sixth Chapter of //Kṛṣṇa,// Wonderful Kṛṣṇa." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...only Indra, even an ordinary person, he thinks he is all in all.

**Dr. Patel:**
When he does work, he says, //ahaṁ kartā, ahaṁ kartā,// like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. They think like that, the //mūḍhas. Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā. Vimūḍha.// Not only //mūḍha; vimūḍha.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Viśeṣa-mūḍha.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Viśeṣa.// But... You are right. "Specifically //mūḍha.//" [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
//Janma karma ca me divyam// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
No. //Yaṁ brahmā varuṇendra-rudra-marutaḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair vedaiḥ sāṅga-pada-krama...// [SB 12.13.1].

**Dr. Patel:**
//Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā...// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...asura// also, they cannot understand, and these so-called scholars, they are interpreting Kṛṣṇa. Go on. [break] //Vimūḍha. Māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
All the Vaiṣṇava books, all... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Vaiṣṇava //ācārya...//

**Dr. Patel:**
No, Vaiṣṇavas, all quotes comes from Vaiṣṇavas. They all believe in the form.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Then I was not able to grasp it, though I am born Vaiṣṇava from my right birth. [break]

**Yadubara:**
Lord Indra is saying that Kṛṣṇa is so merciful that without punishing the offenses of the demons, that He devises means so that their false prestige is subdued.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yadubara:**
How is that? How does He devise means without punishment?

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the device, that He agitated Indra, and he came down and surrendered unto Him. This is the device. Not directly punishing. That he came to understand what is the value of Kṛṣṇa.

**Yadubara:**
“ 'My dear Lord, You are the supreme father, supreme spiritual master and supreme king.' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...accepted by Indra is all described in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// [break]

**Yadubara:**
“ 'You are the root of all creation.' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...composed after //Mahābhārata.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mahābhārata.// Everybody says.

**Yadubara:**
“ 'Due to my gross ignorance, I created great disturbance in Vṛndāvana by sending torrents of rain and heavy hailstorms.' " [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...first of all, being observed by father of Kṛṣṇa. It is very important.

[break] ...necessity of //tapasya,// if one worships Kṛṣṇa? //Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [Nārada Pañcarātra]. And after austerities, if he does not know Kṛṣṇa, then what is the value of his //tapasya?//

[break] ...imitating here, that is lust.

**Dr. Patel:**
Anything with a view on the sex is lust.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is lust. Here everything is lust. Center is lust. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. The central point is sex.

**Dr. Patel:**
That is what... What this...? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...philosophy.

**Dr. Patel:**
Sigmund Freud.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Sigmund Freud. [end]
