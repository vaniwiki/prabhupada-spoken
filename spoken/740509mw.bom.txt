====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Doctor can manage securing medicine, distributing. That is another thing.

**Gopal Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, from his talk I could understand that he actually doesn't want to do much. He said he will not be able to come and examine the patients even.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then?

**Gopal Kṛṣṇa:**
He says, "You try to find some other doctor." He told me, "You find out names and addresses of the local doctors, and we'll pick one of them."

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, we cannot divert our attention. It is not possible. Say, "No." You can say that "We consulted Prabhupāda. He said, 'At the present moment, unless our building is there, we cannot accept any other extra business.' " Tell him like that. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
I suggested. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
For nothing. No, no, that is not possible. These are for the //karmīs,// bodily concept of life. If government has got so many hospitals, what is the use of opening a teeny hospital by us? Vivekananda policy---to collect money by school and hospital. So you can tell him that "At the present moment, we are concerned about the sanction of the building and temple. So when the building is there, then we can consider; not at the present moment. We require money. We collect for this purpose. We cannot divert attention for medicine and other things."

**Gopal Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, I could gather that he just talked, because he also said that we should train up some devotees to do bandage and other things like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] No, no, this is not.

**Bhāgavata:**
We do all the work, and he gets advertised as a great charitable doctor.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it.

**Bhāgavata:**
That he has opened the clinic.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.// [laughs] We are not all these false things. Dr. Ghosh is also after //daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.// [break] We will collect medicine. Our... We shall pay for the expenditure. Our men will be engaged for bandaging. [laughs] Nonsense.

**Bhāgavata:**
And the preaching stops.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. They cannot understand what is the meaning of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are such dull-headed men. They have no brain to understand. They are coming down again. Just like the dog's tail. Know, dog's tail? You may, however grease it... [laughs] They are hearing about this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The aim is the body, the dog's tail. They are hearing daily about Kṛṣṇa na..., but they cannot understand. It is very difficult. These //karmīs...// Now they say... Because we are reading this //Bhāgavatam,// now gradually they dispersed. Gradually they dispersed. They are not interested. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. And if you talk politics and all nonsense, oh, they will gather.

The //go-khara// class. You can say plainly that "For the present, we are not interested. We have got many more important business than this hospitalization." [break]

**Bhāgavata:**
...take Caraṇāravinda from the hospital. So before we left, we had //kīrtana.// And immediately all the patients became happier.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see.

**Bhāgavata:**
The whole attitude was very dull and unhappy and morose, that "Oh, we are in the hospital. My body, my body..." As soon as we had the //kīrtana,// they all got out of the bed and they came and stood around, and they watched, and some were clapping and chanting.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. Immediately life. Oh, just try to understand how much great responsibility you have got.

**Bhāgavata:**
They all appreciated that we made this //kīrtana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Even the Russians appreciate. [aside, to devotee with microphone:] Don't push it in my mouth.

**Devotee:**
Oh, I'm sorry. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. [break] "...bright-faces." [break] They are surprised to see the American boys. "Are you Americans?" Do they not question? Yes. Completely changed. They cannot recognize. Is it not?

**Devotee:**
Yes. [Śrīla Prabhupāda laughs]

**Bhāgavata:**
Because only they are used to seeing these hippies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bhāgavata:**
They are only used to seeing these hippies...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bhāgavata:**
...with beard and the hair, dirty.

**Girirāja:**
My parents telephoned last week, and at first they couldn't recognize my voice. They couldn't believe that it was me.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then?

**Girirāja:**
Kṛṣṇa consciousness has changed the...

**Prabhupāda:**
So your father said that "I could not..."

**Girirāja:**
Yes. He said, "Are you sure it's you?"

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Just like a lawyer. [laughter] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Mother is also very nice. Unless father and mother is nice... I told your mother also. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...she become beautiful, now there is lusty desire.

**Girirāja:**
[reading from //Kṛṣṇa// book] "She frankly proposed to Kṛṣṇa, 'My dear hero, I cannot leave You...' "

**Prabhupāda:**
She was a prostitute. She was a prostitute, but engaged in Kaṁsa's service. In India the prostitutes are engaged as maidservant in respectable houses still. During daytime they serve in some house, and at night they become prostitute. There are many prostitutes. One prostitute, when we were boys, she was coming to serve my mother as a lady barber. There is lady barber, for serving the ladies. And at night she was standing as prostitute. [break] ...a good relation with the neighborhood. There was no enviousness. "She is doing her own business. That's all."

**Bhāgavata:**
So then it's looked on as a necessity in the society.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Prostitute is necessity. Otherwise these rascals, they will pollute all the woman. Therefore, for the rascals there must be some provision. Just like opening wine shop. It is not meant for everyone, but there are drunkards. Unless they get drinking, they will create some disturbance.

**Bhāgavata:**
So just like in Dvārakā there was prostitutes, and they were all devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There are many devotees, prostitutes.

**Bhāgavata:**
So that was their service. Not their service, but that was their work.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bhāgavata:**
But still they were devotees of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is their profession, livelihood, but they are devotees. In Calcutta there is a big temple, it is called Kāca-Kāminī's temple. Kāca-Kāminī means she was a prostitute, but she was kept by a very big businessman who was dealing in glass, mirrors and all... So he has made a temple for her with glass and mirrors. Therefore it is called //kāca. Kāca// means glass. Kāca-Kāminī. [break] ...have a dispensary. Dr. Ojha. He thinks in this way people can be saved. That is also necessary, but not as necessary as this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Girirāja:**
Chapter Forty-two. "The Killing of the Elephant Kuvala..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
We are speaking of Kṛṣṇa. No Indians are interested. Just see. [Hindi with Indian man] Dr. Patel and his company. [Hindi] [break] Hear about the expedition to moon, but not about Kṛṣṇa. [aside:] What is that?

**Devotee:**
It came off.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is all right.

**Devotee:**
There's another one underneath. [end]
