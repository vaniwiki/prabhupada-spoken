====== Morning Walk ======

**Dhanañjaya:**
In Greenland?

**Prabhupāda:**
Others cannot live locally. Heh?

**Satsvarūpa:**
That's not their //karma?//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, //karma// is there. That is another point. My point is that any condition, one can live locally. That is my point. They are supposed to be uncivilized, and they live in the ice cottage. There is no sufficient things for eating, and how they live? That is the point. So why civilized man cannot live locally?

**Satsvarūpa:**
One objection to that is that they say that now cultures have been spread more by all this transportation. You even write that the world is now like a global village. But if everyone just stays in their own place, they won't know what people and culture is like in other parts of the world, and their view will be more narrow.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. They may go sometimes. Just like in India, they used to live locally, but at the same time they used to go to the pilgrimages by walking. It is not prohibited that one should not go out, but when one goes out, he goes out of pleasure, not as obligation. At the present moment it has become an obligation, that one must go out of his home, of his village, of his country. That is defective. There was no need of so many transports. People remained locally. One has to go for livelihood hundred miles. This is defective.

**Dhanañjaya:**
But people say they travel for education.

**Prabhupāda:**
What education? Hippies? Your education has ended into hippies. Finish that education, nonsense education. Now, you have seen in //Harmonist// that the school children, they are having sex intercourse publicly, and they are running naked in America. Is it not?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. It's a very big thing now, running naked.

**Dhanañjaya:**
It's called "streaking."

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever it may be, the nonsense education, result is like that. Is that education? I first, when I saw in Honolulu University---all hippies, all the students, half naked and niggardly dressed. Why so many? They are all students. You see? It has become a fashion. This is the education. And one commissioner has... You have not seen our //Harmonist// prepared? Collapse.

**Satsvarūpa:**
I saw it yesterday. The president of Temple University, he said this was good, this running naked.

**Prabhupāda:**
And another has that "Education has collapsed." [//japa//]

**Dhanañjaya:**
So they have lost all sense of moral values.

**Prabhupāda:**
Animals. The whole material civilization is based on animalism. Therefore now they are coming as naked animals. The basic principle of the civilization is animalism. Now... It was covered by the progress of time---now they are coming to be naked animals, that's all.

**Yogeśvara:**
So this is another problem for Bhagavān's book. So this is another problem form Bhagavān's book.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. That... You have created this animal civilization. Now they are coming out as naked animals. This is the result. Now you have to reform them. That reformation is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So you have to make an example, what is actually human life. Then others will see. You cannot stop them. But some of them, those who are intelligent, they will see, "Yes, here is life." As they are coming to nakedness, they will come to this, our mode of life. So you have to become an ideal society. You live locally and be self-sufficient. They will see that it is possible to live locally without movement, and still highly cultured men, self-sufficient. That is required.

**Yogeśvara:**
Before he left, Bhagavān left me a list of questions. May I ask you some?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yogeśvara:**
One problem that seems to be occurring more and more frequently is the appearance of terrorists, that is to say, men who are motivated for some political..., mostly political reasons.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The whole basic principle I have already explained. Because they are animals, so sometimes ferocious animal. That's all. Animal..., there are different types of animals. Tigers and lions, they are ferocious animal. But you live in the animal society. So animal society, some..., another animal comes as very ferocious, that is not very astonishing. After all, you are living in animal society. So you become human being, ideal. This is the only solution. We have already declared, this is animal society. If some ferocious animal comes out, so where is the astonishment? After all, it is animal society. Either a tiger comes or elephant comes, they are all animals, that's all. But you don't become animal. Counteract. That is required. Then after... A human being is called rational animal. If you come to the rationality, that is required. If you remain also another animal, another type of animal, that will not help you. You have to become actually human being. But //durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma tad apy adhruvam arthadam// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]].

You have to... These people, they have no aim of life. What is the aim of human..., they do not know. So their animal propensities are being adjusted this way, that way, this way, that way. Just like they go to see naked dance. The animal propensity---he is seeing his wife daily naked, and still he is going to see naked dance, and paying some fees. Because they have no engagement except this animalism. Is it not? So what is the use of going to see another woman naked? You are seeing every day, every night, your wife naked. Why you are... Because they have no other engagement, the animals. //Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]. That a dog, it does not know what is the taste. He is simply chewing the one bone, this way, that way, this way, that way. Because he is animal. He has no other engagement. So this whole society is animal. Especially the Westerners. And they have developed a civilization on that animal propensities, means "I am this body, and the best use of my life is to gratify senses." This is animal. "I am this body." Body means the senses. "And to satisfy the senses is the highest perfection." This is their civilization.

So you have to introduce real human civilization. You should not be surprised an animal, in different shapes, in different capacity, comes out. After all, he is an animal. The basic principle is animalism. Because he is thinking, "I am this body..." As the dog is thinking, "I am dog, very stout and strong dog," so another man is thinking, "I am big nation." But what is the basic principle? A dog is also thinking on the basis of his body, and this big nation is also thinking on the basis of body. So there is no difference between this dog and this big nation. The only difference is that human being, by nature's gift, he got better senses. So... And he has no power, or there is no education to utilize the better senses, how to advance spiritually and get out of this material world. That he has no sense. He is simply using that better intelligence for animalism. This is the meaning. He has no education how to utilize the better intelligence. Therefore he is utilizing only in animalism. And people all over the world, when they see the Westerners, "They are advanced." What is that? Advancing in animalism. Basic principle remains the animalism. They become surprised. They also imitate. So they are expanding animalism, animal civilization. Now we have to counteract for the benefit of the human civilization.

**Satsvarūpa:**
They are so ignorant that...

**Prabhupāda:**
An animal is always ignorant.

**Satsvarūpa:**
When we stress on this point, they become very shocked that we talk like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopayati na...// [//Hitopadeśa// 3.4].

**Satsvarūpa:**
"You are calling us animals?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they are animals. Yes. If they are sensible, they can understand, now, what is the difference. A dog is thinking, "I am very stout and strong dog." He has, on the basis of his body. And another man, a big American, thinks, "We are very big nation, powerful nation." So what is the difference between these? The basic principle is there, the bodily consciousness. Therefore it is animalism. Is it not? The basic principle has not changed. Suppose a pickpocket... The same story, Alexander the Great and the thief. He was arrested, and when he convinced him that "What is the difference between you and me? You have got good military strength. You are conquering. And I have got my knife and another thing. I am just going and plundering. So you are also plundering, I am plundering. Why you have caught me? What right you have got to punish me? Because we are the same. You are doing in a larger scale, I am doing in a small scale. That is the difference." So he was set free, "Yes." Alexander the Great, he was sensible man, "Yes, what I am doing? The same thing in a bigger scale, that's all." So these rascal, actually they are animals, but they are declaring advancement. What advancement? The same thing: eating, sleeping, sex and defending. That is animal... The dogs also do like that. They also eat, they also sleep, they have sex life. Now they are coming to the dog's life. A dog, just like street, they have sex life. They are coming, and you have..., "This is advancement, that we have become now pure dog. So long it was hidden; now we are open." This is the civilization, animal civilization.

**Yogeśvara:**
So many social reformers will agree with you...

**Prabhupāda:**
What social? He is animal. How he can reform? First of all, let him become man. What reform? What is the meaning of his reform? He is animal also. That's all. You cannot expect any reformation by the same animal. That is explained. //Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ// [[books:sb:2:3:19|[SB 2.3.19]]]. The so-called leader, he is also animal, and he is eulogized by another animal. This is going on. And another animal, one animal, big animal, is being elected as the president. Therefore you are suffering. Nixon. What is Nixon? He is also another animal. And the animals have elected him president. That's all. This is going on. Where is the human being?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Just like in the forest. The animals, they select the lion to be the king.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So this is going on. That is condemned. One who is not God conscious, one who does not know that he is not body, he is animal. That's all. Maybe in different dress, in different...

**Yogeśvara:**
So here in Italy...

**Prabhupāda:**
So you have to set up real human society in a small scale so people will see, "Yes." Because man has got intelligence. Just like, although I am condemning the Western mode of life, still, so many Western young boys, they have come. I never came to speak to flatter you, that "Your Western civilization is very nice." I never said that. Why you are coming? I never came to flatter you, neither I never came to say, "Yes, there is no God." I am speaking just opposite, everything opposite. "You are drunkard; no drink. You are illicit sex hunters; no illicit sex." So I am just speaking opposite, from the beginning of my preaching. So why you are coming? So if you stick to your position, real human civilization, people will come, gradually. Because they have got the sense. When we say others as animals, as demons, we don't say whimsically, capriciously. No. On the basis of sound knowledge. Therefore our declaration is completely right. We are not mental speculators, that I say some gentleman, "You are animal." No. I see, I know that he is animal; therefore I say. A man is running his motorcar, [makes sound] //ra-ra-ra-ra-ra,// and a dog is running. We don't see any difference, although he is on the motorcar. We don't find any difference. He is as good as the dog. Unnecessarily he is running. What is the meaning of running of the dog?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Actually the man is making more noise than the dog. Making more noise.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. So we say another dog is running in a different way. That's all. These are very strong words. People will be angry. But this is a fact.

**Yogeśvara:**
So here's a practical problem. People would be interested to know our position on divorce.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Yogeśvara:**
Divorce. Here in Rome they just passed a divorce law.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is also animalism. Just like a dog having sex intercourse with another female dog, and another, another, another. It is also animalism. So that is your decision. They are animals, and different way they are coming to be naked animal, that's all. The divorce is also dog's business. Dog is having sex intercourse with this female dog and another, another, another, another. It is animalism, that's all.

**Yogeśvara:**
But people are objecting, that "If we cannot get divorced, then we are forced to live with each other even if we hate each other."

**Prabhupāda:**
But hate each other, that's all right. We say what is the use of your sexual intercourse? That is animalism. You avoid it. Our Vedic civilization is to avoid it. Therefore they remain //brahmacārī, naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī,// no sexual intercourse in the whole life. That is perfection.

**Yogeśvara:**
But that's not possible for the mass of people.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, why not possible? We have got so many. Just like Śukadeva Gosvāmī: he remained completely //brahmacārī,// although naked he is, even he is. He doesn't require, and neither he is agitated. Just like when he was passing, the girls were taking bath. They did not take care, because they knew that he is not at all affected by any woman. And when his father was going, they covered. So father inquired, Vyāsadeva, a personality like Vyāsadeva, said, "Why you covered? I am old man, and my young son, he was passing naked." They said that "He is //paramahaṁsa.// He has no agitation of the mind. But you are //gṛhastha.// You live with woman. You have got distinction, man and woman."

So this is civilization. What is the use of sex life? It is simply entanglement. Therefore, at the last stage, one is supposed to become //sannyāsī.// What is //sannyāsī? Vānaprastha, sannyāsī, brahmacārī//---no sex life. Out of the three..., four different status of life, the //brahmacārī// has no sex life, the //vānaprastha// has no sex life, the //sannyāsī// has no sex life. Only the //gṛhastha.// That means it is prohibitory. It is allowed---it is a simply concession to the person who cannot remain without sex life. It is simply a concession. Otherwise, according to Vedic civilization, there is no need of sex life. Because it is entanglement, simply entanglement. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tucchaṁ kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]].

The example has been given, there is itching between the two hands. That's all. That means the itching disease is increased. This has been the description of sex life. //Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.// Although behind the sex life there are so many troubles, but still the rascals do not cease. Either illicit sex or legal sex... Legal sex you beget children, there are so many troubles. You have to raise them nicely, you have to give them education, you must be situated [indistinct]. That is the duty of father. Otherwise, he would go on, begetting like cats and dogs, no responsibility. Just like some of our students, immediately married and again, "Give me //sannyāsa.//" What is this? Irresponsible, that's all. Irresponsibility.

So these things are not required at all. These things are not required. //Bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.// After marrying they see it is very great responsibility. "Now let me take //sannyāsa.//" That's all. Why you marry? Because he finds that after marriage there are so many difficulties. So irresponsible man. So after, there is difficulties; that's a fact. So why should you go to the difficulty? Therefore the conclusion is the married life is not required. But if you cannot tolerate, all right, get this concession, live very gentlemanly. This is marriage. Otherwise, for higher sense, higher elevation... Higher elevation, of course, one who is actually on the higher elevation, he is married or not married, it doesn't matter. But on the whole, the sex life is not necessary.

**Yogeśvara:**
So these Italian women are complaining now that their husbands are abusing them, so why can they not get divorced?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Yogeśvara:**
The Italian women. The women in Italy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you marry?

**Yogeśvara:**
Obviously, they wanted sex in the beginning, but they didn't know it was going to be so much trouble.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] That is our point. Then why do you marry? Just begin Kṛṣṇa conscious, and you will find without sex you will be happy.

**Yogeśvara:**
But what do we advise such women?

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever they... Others women, they may take lesson from them, that "If these woman are suffering or these men are suffering, why should we marry?" There is a Bengali proverb, //dekhe sekhe// and //tekhe sekhe[?].// One who is intelligent, he can see what is happening, he becomes cautious. And one when actually experienced, then he becomes cautious. Less intelligent. So if it is not good, why you are marrying? Why you are induced by sex life? Stop it by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you devote yourself, the whole life, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you will not be agitated by any sex life. And that is //yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-pādāravinde// [Yāmunācārya]. If one is actually advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he will deride: "Huh! Nonsense! What is this?" That is Kṛṣṇa conscious advancement. This only remedy, prime remedy for all solution, is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That we have to show. [//japa//] So answers are all right or not?

**Yogeśvara:**
No, very nice. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Our life is so nice. We are satisfied with eating //kṛṣṇa-prasādam// and chant whole day and night Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. What is the use of this industry and trade and transport and politics? There is no need. //Anartha.// It is called //anartha,// unwanted things.

> anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād
> bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje
> lokasyājānato vidvāṁś
> cakre sātvata-saṁhitām
> [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]

These are all //anarthas,// unwanted things. So to stop these //anarthas// this //bhakti-yoga. Anartha upaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje, lokasya.// These rascals, they do not know. Therefore //vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām. Vidvān,// the most learned man, Vyāsadeva, has written this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

> anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād
> bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje
> lokasyājānato vidvāṁś
> cakre sātvata-saṁhitām
> [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]

This is all described. First of all, the first defect is that you are eternal spirit soul. Why you should be entangled with this material body? That is the first fault. That is //anartha.// I am spirit soul. Why shall I accept this material body? That is my basic principle of unwanted things. And to make solution how to get out of this material entanglement. And that is... //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. After leaving this body, now this is the last, and then I am not coming to this material world. How? Simply by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt, gurur na sa syāt, na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum// [[books:sb:5:5:18|[SB 5.5.18]]]. The //Bhāgavata// says that "One should not become parent, father and mother, one should not become //guru,// one should not become friend, one should not become husband, one..."---these are the guardians---"if one cannot release his dependent from this repetition of birth and death." This is civilization. This is civilization. Not that "I am now human being; I shall become demigod," or "I am dog; I shall become human being." They are thinking this is... The //karmīs,// they are thinking this is advancement. This is not advancement. Real advancement: no more accepting any material body. That is the real advancement. Just finish.

This sense can come in human form of life, that "I have suffered so much. I have coming through so many species of life. Now I have got sense." So the reply is there that //mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvataṁ nāpnuvanti// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]: "Anyone who comes to Me, he does not come again to this miserable condition of material existence." We should take advantage of these things. That is human civilization. What is this human civilization? Jumping like dog, in a motorcar, that's all. This is not civilization. This is dog civilization, that's all. And actually what the benefit they have derived? They are not satisfied. One man has got this car, and next year another car, another car. And the car manufacturer also giving fashion: "This is 1974 edition, this is 1975 edition." And they are earning money with hard labor. "All right, get a motorcar." And again, next year change. What is this civilization? No satisfaction. They do not know where is the point of satisfaction. It is dog civilization.

**Yogeśvara:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, the way you've been describing our solutions to the problems of the world, they seem to be on two levels. One is the extended solution, that is to say, the ultimate solution of Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, there is no question of extended. You keep yourself in a limited solution. And then, when it is appreciated it will be automatically extended. You don't touch the extended. You become ideal civilized man. Others will follow.

**Yogeśvara:**
Well, for example, ultimately we want to live locally. These cities are not necessary. But still, the cities for now...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you make the best use of a bad bargain. We shall depend more... Just like in New Vrindaban, they are coming to the city for preaching. So not absolutely we can abstain immediately, because we have been dependent so long, many, many lives. You cannot. But the ideal should be introduced gradually. And make it perfect more and more and more and more. But there is possibility. Possibility if you live locally and make your arrangement, you get your food... The real necessity is, bodily necessity is, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. This is necessity. So if you can eat locally, you can sleep locally, you can have your sex life also locally and you can defend locally, then where is the wrong? These are the necessities. We are not stopping this. We are not stopping: "No more sex life." That is nonsense, another nonsense. You must have. Marry. That's all. So you can marry locally and live. Where is the difficulty? Defend. If somebody comes to attack, there must be men to defend. And eating and sleeping. Where is your difficulty? Manage locally, as far as possible. After all, these are the necessities of body. So it can be solved locally. Is it impossible to solve the bodily necessities? What do you think? Is it impossible?

**Satsvarūpa:**
No, it's very simple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then do it. Do it. Set example perfectly. [//japa//] This is nice park. Yes. You can have your park locally. Where is the difficulty? Garden. Fruits, flowers, garden. That is park. Also you can have a pond like this. People are doing that locally, in Bengal especially. Whole Bengal was a garden. It was so nice. Whole Bengal was a garden.

**Dhanañjaya:**
I noticed this when I took the train from Calcutta to Krishnanagar. Once you get further out, it's so nice, the villages. There is the pond there...

**Prabhupāda:**
And... Why Calcutta? You go to the airport, you will find so nice gardens, still existing. Now it is spoiled also, because people have changed locally to the city. Nobody has to take care now. Otherwise, in Bengal especially, throughout the whole India, Bengal was so beautiful. The Europeans became attracted by the beauty of Bengal. Therefore they made Calcutta their capital, the Britishers. Yes. Every European liked Bengal. Every European. I met one European German gentleman in Bombay. He was in Calcutta, when I was in Bimha[?]. So I asked, "Why you left Calcutta?" "Oh, I am very sorry. Calcutta was so nice." And actually. Where we have got our temple, these quarters were known as "Sahib" quarter. Just like our temple is "Sahib" temple. So these Chowringee and Camac Street, Park, these were all European. They liked very much to live in Bengal. And there is another story: One English officer, he became attracted by the beauty of a Bengali woman. There is story by Bankim Chandra. Chandrashekhara. The man was after that woman, how to get it. That is the subject matter of story. He was attracted by the black eyes and black hair. Bengali beauty.

**Yogeśvara:**
Kṛṣṇa has black hair, too.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you bring Kṛṣṇa here? This is all sense gratification. [laughter]

**Yogeśvara:**
Well, if he could only have been attracted to Kṛṣṇa...

**Prabhupāda:**
But that is very good that even in talking this material, you remembered Kṛṣṇa. That is very good. You remember Kṛṣṇa. When childish playing, if you remember Kṛṣṇa's childhood, that is very good. That is very good. Some way or other, if you get the chance of remembering Kṛṣṇa, that is advancement.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Even if the example is not so clear or good.

**Prabhupāda:**
That doesn't matter. You remember Kṛṣṇa some way or other. Kṛṣṇa does not belong to this abominable material world, but it is benefit for you because you remembered Kṛṣṇa. [//japa//]

**Yogeśvara:**
The manager of a large factory comes to us and says, "Well, here is my problem: my workers are striking for higher pay, and no one is satisfied So what can I do?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Yogeśvara:**
Well, he wants to know, "How can I apply that in my factory?"

**Prabhupāda:**
You give us the in charge, make us in charge of the factory, we shall do it, and see how we can deal. You can do it. We shall introduce immediately //kīrtana// and give them //prasādam.// It will be solved. And give them lecture and philosophy. We can take. Let us have the charge, then see how we can do it. Or you follow our instruction. But that you will not. You want to exploit these poor fellows, and you are coming to us for solution. You first of all give us the spirit of exploiting. Then it will be solved. You have come to take our advice how to exploit them.

**Yogeśvara:**
So he would ask, "Do I have to close my factory?"

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we shall run on the factory. You give us in charge. We don't want anything from you. Let us manage. I can manage. Just organize //saṅkīrtana.// It will be solved. Now, these factory men works and goes home. So if you say that "You come early in the morning and you take //prasādam// here and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa half an hour," they will immediately agree. Immediately agree. And give them good //prasādam// and have chanting for one hour. They will be all submissive. Is it not? Will they not agree? At least, they will see that "We haven't got to spend money for our food at home. We shall get nice food here. Let us chant. What is the harm?" And as soon as he chants, he becomes a gentleman. That's all.

**Yogeśvara:**
So because we will have cut down his expenses, he will be satisfied with the pay that he has. We would not have to give him more money.

**Prabhupāda:**
They will not take any payment. Just like under me so many Europeans and Americans work daily. I don't pay them a farthing. When they become Kṛṣṇa conscious, you'll haven't got to pay anything. But you cannot take also anything. You cannot..., you do not expect that "I don't have to pay anything, so it is very good profit." No, sir, you cannot take also anything. If I would have taken all the sales produced of the book selling, then you would not work. Because although it is my books, I do not take any profit or any sales proceeds, therefore you work. Similarly, these rascals, the proprietor of the factories, if they do not take anything, they will also agree not to take anything. Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Then the solution is there.

**Yogeśvara:**
So in other words the workers are unsatisfied because they see that the managers are exploiting them, but if they see the managers are giving the money to Kṛṣṇa, they will feel satisfied.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, and they will also give. Kṛṣṇa becomes the proprietor. Everyone is satisfied.

**Dhanañjaya:**
//Jaya.// This is //varṇāśrama// institution.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. This is above //varṇāśrama.// It is above //varṇāśrama. Varṇāśrama,// there is give and take, but here there is no give and... Here is simply give, no take. That is above //varṇāśrama.//

**Dhanañjaya:**
So the workers are giving to the devotees and the devotees are giving to Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They become devotee, they will give to Kṛṣṇa. You also become devotees. Not that they become devotee and you exploit them very nicely. That is not.

**Satsvarūpa:**
It is getting a little late. We should... for our Class.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which way we shall go?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Just up here. [break]

**Satsvarūpa:**
...their nuts and bolts.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, nuts, if there is demand, let this go on. Why shall I shut down? But we cannot run on this slaughterhouse program... [indistict] [break] [end]
