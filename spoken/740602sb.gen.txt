Translation: "My uncle, you must have visited Dvārakā. In that holy place there are our friends and well-wishers, the descendants of Yadu, who are always rapt in the service of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. You might have seen them or heard about them. Are they all living happily in their abodes?"

**Prabhupāda:**

> api naḥ suhṛdas tāta
> bāndhavāḥ kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ
> dṛṣṭāḥ śrutā vā yadavaḥ
> sva-puryāṁ sukham āsate
> [[books:sb:1:13:11|[SB 1.13.11]]]

So Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja, after meeting Vidura, the first inquiry was about the family of Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Now, because he has come back home by touring different places of pilgrimage... Dvārakā is also one of the celebrated place of pilgrimage. So he expected that "Vidura must have gone to Dvārakā. And when he had gone to Dvārakā, he must have some news from Kṛṣṇa's place."

So Kṛṣṇa is the friend, most intimate friend of the Pāṇḍavas. Therefore he says, //naḥ. Naḥ// means "our." //Suhṛdaḥ. Suhṛdaḥ,// this word, "always thinking of others' good," that is called //suhṛdaḥ.// The heart is not contaminated. //Hṛdaḥ// means "heart," and //su// means "very good." So Kṛṣṇa says also that //suhṛda sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. And here Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja confirms, //naḥ suhṛdaḥ.// Actually, Kṛṣṇa is //suhṛda. Suhṛda// means well-wisher. As the father is the well-wisher of the sons or intimate friend, well-wisher... Here in the material world, although I may be your well-wisher, you may be well-wisher, but there is some interest. Unless there is some interest for my personal benefit, I cannot become your //suhṛda.// This is material //suhṛda.// But spiritual //suhṛda// is different. Spiritual //suhṛda// means everyone is suffering for want of spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore attempt should be made so that everyone becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is spiritual //suhṛda.//

We are now entangled. Actually, our position in this material existence is not very good. Everyone sees it practically. Still, they want to adjust, "Let us make it good. Let us make it good." That is called //punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]], again and again chewing the chewed. Just like generally a father, especially in India, he wants that his son may be well situated. Therefore we don't get Indian youth very much, because the father and mother settles them. What is that? Get them married and give them some earning capacity, either by service or business. So he becomes satisfied, "This is the end of life." //Gṛhamedhi.// Just "Now I am married. It is my duty to stick to the //gṛha// and enjoy senses, that's all." //Gṛhamedhi.// Sacrifice for Kṛṣṇa, //brahmacārī, sannyāsī... Sannyāsīs// have become rogues. And there is no //brahmacārī// nor //vānaprastha.// Therefore it is very difficult to get Indian workers. They have no...

Your qualification is---I told in the beginning---that you have got a renouncing spirit. That is a great qualification. //Tyāga.// Renunciation is opulence also. Kṛṣṇa, six opulences. One of the opulence is renunciation. //Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ, jñāna-vairāgya// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. //Vairāgya// means renunciation. You have enough of this material enjoyment. You have enjoyed. Or you have seen that there is no actually profit. Therefore you are in a spirit... That is natural. That is natural. If one has enjoyed very much, the next stage will be renunciation. This is natural. So because you have got a renouncing spirit, you are understanding or taking Kṛṣṇa consciousness very nicely, at least, very eagerly. //Jñāna-vairāgya,// that is required. This //vairāgya// then... I therefore sometimes like these hippies, because they have a spirit of renunciation. That is very good position. Simply they require //jñāna,// or knowledge. Then their life will be successful. To bring one to the platform of renunciation, that is a very difficult job. Especially when one has got nice wife, nice home, nice bank balance, it is very, very difficult.

So there is a version by Kṛṣṇa that one who is anxious to take Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but he is entrapped with this binding---nice wife, nice children, nice home, nice bank balance---so Kṛṣṇa, in order to give them..., give such devotee facility, He takes away. //Hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ. Yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ// [SB 10.88.8]. Just like He did with the Pāṇḍavas. The Pāṇḍavas were devotees, but at the same time they were king. There was attachment. So therefore Kṛṣṇa took away their everything---their kingdom, their wife, their position, their honor---test him, and still, they did not give up Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they came out victorious. So Kṛṣṇa sometimes tests His..., that how much one devotee is, He forcibly makes him renounced in order. That is Kṛṣṇa's special favor.

So this //vairāgya-jñāna,// it is required. We were discussing the last night also, //vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodha// [[books:bg:4:10|[Bg. 4.10]]], these things are required. Unless one becomes completely..., what is called? Averse?

**Yogeśvara:**
Detached.

**Prabhupāda:**
Detached: "So what is this nonsense material life?" That's a very good qualification. If one understands this perfectly---"This is all rubbish, this material enjoyment"---it is a great qualification. //Akiñcana. Akiñcana. Akiñcana// means do not possess anything material. //Akiñcana-gocara.// Kuntī, Kuntī, Queen Kuntī, when she was receiving Kṛṣṇa, she said, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, You are //akiñcana-gocara.// You are realized by a person who has no material possession. And You have given us now so much material possession. How we can understand You?" That was... Kuntī was regretting that "When we are in distress, You are always with us. Now You have given us kingdom and everything. Now You are going away to Dvārakā. What is this, Kṛṣṇa? Better let us go to again to that distressed condition so that You remain with us." //Akiñcana-gocara.// Kṛṣṇa is //akiñcana-gocara.// Anyone who wants to enjoy material life, it is not possible to become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is very secret.

Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya// [[books:cc:madhya:11:8|[Cc. Madhya 11.8]]]. //Bhagavad-bhajana,// to become devotee, Kṛṣṇa conscious, is meant for //niṣkiñcanasya,// one who does not possess anything in the material world. That does not mean he should be poverty-stricken. No. He should know it fully that "Nothing belongs to me; everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. I am simply His servant, that's all." This is called //akiñcana.// If I think that "Keeping Kṛṣṇa in front, let me possess some material things," that is another cheating. That is not... //Akiñcana.// You should be fully conscious that "Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa and nothing to us." Then Kṛṣṇa becomes your //suhṛda.// He takes charge, how your benefit will be there, ultimate. //Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakaṁ dadāmi// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. //Prīti-pūrvakam.// This is very great determination, that "Kṛṣṇa, I simply want You, nothing, anything else. Nothing."

//Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taught this philosophy repeatedly. //Niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajana. Bhagavad-bhajana// means He Himself became //niṣkiñcana.// He was Kṛṣṇa Himself, most opulent. //Tyaktvā surepsitaḥ, sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīm// [SB 11.5.34]. Caitanya Mahāprabhu had the most beautiful wife, goddess of fortune, Viṣṇu-priyā, Lakṣmī-priyā. But for the benefit of the whole world, although He is Kṛṣṇa, He showed us the example. At the age of twenty-four years, He took //sannyāsa.// He was not unhappy in His home. He had His very affectionate mother and... [aside:] Some fly... Affectionate mother and most affectionate wife, beloved wife. But still, it is very difficult to renounce the affection of mother and love of wife. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu did it. [aside:] The fly is still disturbing. So //tyaktvā sudustyaja.// Therefore in the //Bhāgavata// it is said, //sudustyaja,// very difficult to give up. [aside:] The fan. //Tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīm.// And //rājya-lakṣmīm,// such nice beautiful wife, desired even by the demigods. Such a nice wife, He gave up.

//Tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ dharmiṣṭha ārya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam// [SB 11.5.34]. //Agād araṇyam. Araṇyam// means, going to the forest means, to take //sannyāsa.// Going to the Himalaya does not mean or going to the forest does not mean that he should actually go there. One should give up this family affection and dedicate the whole life for Kṛṣṇa's service. That is really going to the forest. Not that unnecessarily. It may be beneficial for person, for his personal self, but real renunciation is to have no more interest in so-called limited jurisdiction of family, social, international, national, but the whole interest is for Kṛṣṇa. That is real renunciation. That is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Renunciation does not mean give up this world. That I was explaining. Our philosophy is not the //jagat// is //mithyā.// Why //jagan mithyā?// We don't say that. //Jagat// is fact. It may be temporary, but it is a fact. Now, so long we have got this //jagat,// let us utilize it for Kṛṣṇa. That is renunciation. We cannot say this microphone is //mithyā.// So long the microphone is in my possession, let it be used for Kṛṣṇa's service. This is renunciation. Everyone using this microphone, these modern machines, for his personal gain. But we are not using for personal gain. We are traveling all over the world, spending so much money, jet plane and this plane, just to push Kṛṣṇa consciousness as much as possible. This is renunciation, not that sitting one place doing nothing and become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then there will be falldown. Don't imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura. That is not possible. You must work.

So to such person, Kṛṣṇa is //suhṛda. Suhṛda.// Here it is said, //api naḥ suhṛdas tāta,// uncle, //bāndhavāḥ kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ. Kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ// means one who has accepted Kṛṣṇa as the worshipable Deity. He is called //kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ.// There are so many demigods they have taken to worship. The Romans were worshiping demigods. The India, in India they also worship demigods. That will not make you happy. //Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. To take some benediction from the demigods, although people go there, //kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṁ siddhiṁ yajanta iha devatāḥ// [[books:bg:4:12|[Bg. 4.12]]]. People are very much attached to enjoy this material world, so they worship Durgā, Kālī, or Lord Śiva. //Kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṁ siddhim.// They get immediately some material benefit. But //tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām.// What you will do with some temporary material benefit? That is the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. Don't be attracted by the temporary material benefits. Just try for permanent, eternal benefit. Go back to home, back to Godhead. That is the... That is the... What you will do? Suppose you become king. How long you will remain king? Or there are so many dangers. Sometimes the kings are beheaded. King John was beheaded. So material position is always tiltering, tilting. Yes. There is no fixed position. It will end. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //antavat tu phalaṁ teṣām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. //Antavat// means it will end, today or tomorrow or hundred years after. It will end. So why should you... You are eternal. Why should you hanker after these things which will exist for some few years? You are eternal. Accept the eternal position. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Eternal position.

So for that eternal position, you have to make //kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ,// Kṛṣṇa as the worshipable Deity. Kṛṣṇa is eternal, and if you fix up your service to Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa will accept you as servant; naturally, you become eternal. There is a very nice story. Nice story not; a fact. Sāvitrī-Satyavān. Sāvitrī-Satyavān. This, I mean to say, incidences are mentioned in the //śāstras// to give us lesson. Sāvitrī was a very chaste, devoted woman. Sāvitrī. In India, to the woman, in order to become very chaste and devoted to husband, they observe the ritualistic ceremony to worship Sāvitrī-Satyavān. So Sāvitrī was in love with a boy who was destined to die on the marriage date, but still, she married. She knew that "As soon as I will be married, on the same day, my husband will die." So she pleased the Yamarāja. After the death... The husband died, but she pleased the Yamarāja so much so that Yamarāja was ready to give her some benediction. So Yamarāja said, "What benediction you want?" "Now, as woman, I wish that may be a son of mine, from me." "All right, you will get a son." Then again she said that "If you are taking away my husband, how I will get my son?" So her husband was made alive. So indirectly... So //kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ.// If you actually want to be eternally blissful, take to //kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ.// Or there is no need of praying for "Make me immortal." No. If you accept //kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ,// then automatically... Just like the benediction was that "You... Yes, you will get a son." Automatically her husband was made alive. So //kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ.//

So Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja asking that "Did you see them, the Yadu families, who have Kṛṣṇa as their worshipable Deity?" //Dṛṣṭāḥ śrutā vā yadavaḥ. Yadu. Yadavaḥ// is plural number. //Sva-puryāṁ sukham āsate:// "Whether they are happy in their home," //sva-puryām, sva-purī,// "Dvārakā?" So in this way Kṛṣṇa consciousness means always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. And make Kṛṣṇa the friend. Kṛṣṇa says that //suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. Actually, Kṛṣṇa is the only friend, and He is sitting in everyone's heart. He is so nice friend that He is simply trying to induce us to turn our face towards Kṛṣṇa. He is coming as //avatāra,// incarnation. He is giving us advice from within. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He's such a nice friend. Although we have left Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa has not left us. Here He is living with me within my heart to give me advice, "Please come back." //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam.//

So Kṛṣṇa is so nice friend. He is such a nice friend that even to the enemy He gives the greatest benediction. Just like Pūtanā. Pūtanā came to kill Kṛṣṇa, smearing poison on her breast. But Kṛṣṇa gave her promotion on the motherly platform. Kṛṣṇa is so grateful that "This demon might have come to Me to poison Me, but I have sucked her breast. She has become My mother, therefore she must get the position of My mother." Kṛṣṇa is so grateful. If you give little service to Kṛṣṇa sincerely, Kṛṣṇa will never forget you. And He's so powerful. If Kṛṣṇa becomes your friend and Kṛṣṇa remembers you, then what you want more? Just imagine. So Kṛṣṇa... Here it is said, //kṛṣṇa-devatāḥ.// Fix up your mind in Kṛṣṇa and be happy.

Thank you very much.
