====== Arrival Address ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So I am very happy to see that Rādhā-Parisīśvara is being worshiped nicely.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy is very simple, but the dull-headed person cannot understand. That is the difficulty. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that the...

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

There are many classes of men, they have been classified as the //duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā,// and all of them are based on the atheistic theory, "There is no God. I am God." //Asuri bhāvam, asura. Asura// means they defy God, "I am God. Who is God?" Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu and his son, Prahlāda Mahārāja. Prahlada Mahārāja is devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and Hiraṇyakaśipu would not accept. "Who is God? I am God." This is atheistic attitude.

So the atheist are divided into four classes. Number one is //duṣkṛtina. Duṣkṛtina// means they have got merit. //Kṛti// means meritorious. The modern men, they have got merit. Especially the Western people, they have got nice merit. Just like while passing through the city, we saw very nice buildings. So to construct such buildings it requires merit, undoubtedly. But what for this building? //Duṣkṛtina,// only for committing sinful life. Therefore it is called //du, duṣkalya.// Meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication and gambling. Meritorious they are undoubtedly for constructing this building, but what is the purpose? The purpose is sinful activities. These things are going on. Therefore they are called //duṣkṛtina.// And //mūḍha. Mūḍha// means they cannot understand what is God. It is very simple thing. Anyone can..., a child can understand. Take for example your body, my body. What is the important thing in the body? The soul. Without the soul, you may be very big man, even Napoleon Bonaparte, but as soon as the soul is gone, it is useless. The whole world is useless. Anyone can understand. Where is now Napoleon Bonaparte, who struggled so much for glorifying France? But where is that gentleman? Finished. As soon as the soul is gone... You may keep one statue, dead statue, that is another thing. But you do not know where the soul has gone and what he is doing now.

So anyone can understand that this body may be very, very important---scientist, politicians and so on, so on. But as soon as the soul is gone from this body, it is useless, not worth even a farthing. Anyone can understand. Similarly, as the soul is the important thing in this body, my body, your body or anyone's body, similarly in this huge, gigantic body of universe, there must be one soul. Otherwise how it is going on? How it is working so nicely? The big sun is rising exactly in time, the moon is rising exactly in time, the seasons are changing one after another. So many millions and millions of living entities, they are being maintained. Everyone is getting their food, even the elephant, who eats at a time hundred kilogram, he also eats. An ant also eats. The birds also eat, the beast also eats---there is no problem. Only the civilized man, so-called civilized man, he creates problem, because //duṣkṛtina.// He has got merit, but it is being used for sinful activities. Therefore there is problem. Otherwise there is no... If the birds have no problem, the beasts have no problem, the ant has no problem, why the civilized man has got problem? Because they are //duṣkṛtina// and //mūḍha.// Rascal, and always engaged in sinful activities, //duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ.// Simple thing.

If the soul is important in this body, why there shall not be bigger soul, the Supersoul, in this gigantic body? What is this universal body and this body? The same thing. It is only small, and that is very big. The same material construction. //Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]], this earth, water, air. Just like you have got your bones, the huge earth mountain, that is also another bone of this gigantic body. As you have got your hairs on the body, the millions and millions of trees and plants, they are also the hairs of the gigantic body. So as you have got holes in your body here, there, and the navel, similarly these oceans and seas, they are also different holes. So they are described---it is not my imagination---they are described in the //Bhagavad-gī..., Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Second Canto, to conceive the gigantic body. As you have got your skull, the round skull, the whole, I mean to say, hemisphere is also skull of this gigantic body. It is similar. As you have got a body and you, the soul, is the important thing, active principle within this body, similarly this gigantic body, the active principle is there, that is we call from the //śāstra// Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. The same comparison. But because they are //mūḍha,// rascal, they cannot understand it. No brain.

We have no brain. We are all not very intelligent. But we can understand if there is the active principle soul within this body, there must be a Supersoul within this huge structure of body, and that is called God. //Mohitaṁ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam// [[books:bg:7:13|[Bg. 7.13]]]. Those who are bewildered, //narādhamāḥ. Narādhamāḥ,// the lowest of the mankind. These things cannot be understood by the cats and dogs. Their body is constituted in such a way that they cannot think of there is an active principle within this body and there is active principle in this huge, gigantic body. The cats and dogs cannot understand, but a human being can understand. And that active principle is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. As the active principle within this body is all-attractive, this beautiful body of French boys and girls, why? The active principle is there; therefore they are attractive. Many people come to see your city. Why? The active principle is there.

So Kṛṣṇa means the active principle of everything. That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo
> mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate
> iti matvā bhajante māṁ
> budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ
> [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]

The active principle is everything. From His energy, material energy, this huge, gigantic material man..., cosmic manifestation is there, from His energy. And we are also His energy. //Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. The five material elements are also Kṛṣṇa's energy, and we living entities, we are also. //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā, jīva-bhūtaṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]. Everything is explained there. But the //mūḍhas,// these //duṣkṛtinas,// the //narādhamas,// they cannot understand. //Narādhama// means lowest of the mankind. Why? Because cats and dogs cannot understand this philosophy. But a human being can understand. He has got the brain. Nature has given the fertile brain, but they are misusing it, //duṣkṛtina,// only for sense gratification. The brain was given to understand God, but the rascal is using for illicit sex, meat-eating, drinking and gambling. This is the position of the whole human society.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to give the greatest benefit to the human society to clear their brain, the rascal brain. We call, declare, they are all rascals. Let any scientist, philosopher come here, I shall prove that he is nothing but a rascal. I shall prove that. I challenge them. What they are doing? Nonsense. So you do not become rascals. By the grace of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, you are trying to understand this Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy, and there is no difficulty. Everything is there in our //Bhagavad-gītā.// You simply try to understand, and make your life successful. That is our request. Don't be rascals, //mūḍhas, narādhamas, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.// This education has no value, because the real knowledge, there is nothing. Real knowledge is to understand God. There is no education throughout the whole world, there is no university. So they are simply producing rascals. So my only request is that don't become rascals. You just worship here Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. //Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtiḥ// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. Just try to understand Kṛṣṇa and then your life will be successful.

In what way?

> janma karma me divyaṁ
> yo jānāti tattvataḥ
> tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma
> naiti mām eti...
> [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]

If you simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa, the result will be that after giving up this body, you will not accept any more material body. You will remain in your spiritual body and go back to home, back to Godhead. That is your eternal life, blissful, full of knowledge. That is wanted. Otherwise, now you have got this very beautiful body, French girl, French boy, if you don't take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if you lose the opportunity, then you may get..., because you have got very good friend, dogs. [laughter] So //yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvam// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]], so at the time of dying, you will think of dog and you will get a body of dog. This is a fact. Because you are under the grip of material nature. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. As you infect some disease, you must suffer from that disease. Similarly, the infection of ignorance, //tamo-guṇa,// will give you a //tamo-guṇa// body. //Jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ// [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]. Go down. Nature gives you the opportunity: get a nice human form of body, nice brain, try to understand what is God. But if you misuse it, then again go to become cats and dogs and hogs. This is nature's law. Don't risk your life. Always think of Kṛṣṇa. //Sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]]. These things are explained.

So what is the difficulty to become Kṛṣṇa conscious? You have got nice Deity; Kṛṣṇa is present to take your service. And be pure, eat nice //prasādam,// chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, dance, and go to back to home, back to Godhead. Where is the difficulty? Simple thing. Don't be misled by the rascals and fools. Just try to understand Kṛṣṇa, try to hear Kṛṣṇa---His instruction is there---and be happy.

Thank you very much.
