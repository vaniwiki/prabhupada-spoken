====== Initiation Ceremony ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//...puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa bahyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ// [Garuḍa Purāṇa]:

"I offer my respectful obeisances whose name, holy name, by remembering, by chanting, one becomes purified in either condition, purified or impurified," //apavitraḥ, pavitraḥ; sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā,// "in all circumstances."

So, so long we are in this material encagement we are supposed to be impurified. Because we are not purified, therefore we have to accept birth, death, old age and disease. Just like diseased condition is impurified. It requires to be purified by medical treatment to get out of the disease. So we living entities, we are part and parcel of God. Our original position is purified, but at the present moment we are contaminated. So by chanting the holy name of the Lord we become purified. The holy name of the Lord and the Lord, identical. By association with the Supreme Lord directly, by chanting the holy name, we become purified. //Oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā, yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣam// [Garuḍa Purāṇa]. Kṛṣṇa, His name is Puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ. //Puṇḍarīka// means lotus flower; //akṣam// means eyes---whose eyes are just like the lotus flower. Lord Visnu, or Kṛṣṇa, is identified with lotus flower in so many places. His navel is like lotus flower, His eyes are like lotus flower, His feet, lotus feet. So lotus is the comparison of the beauty of different limbs or parts of the body, transcendental body of Kṛṣṇa.

So those who are going to be initiated, they should understand that chanting of the holy name means directly associating with the Supreme Lord. So as I have given several times the example of the iron rod and the fire---if you touch the iron rod with the fire, it becomes warmer, warmer and then red hot---similarly, when you chant offenselessly the holy name of the Lord, gradually you become purified, and when we chant holy name without any offense, then we immediately live at the shelter of Lord Kṛṣṇa. When we are almost free from contamination, then we become liberated, and when we chant purely the holy name, we are situated on the lotus feet of the Lord. And the more we go on chanting, we enjoy loving exchange affair between the Lord and ourself.

So we will explain the ten kinds of offenses, and the initiated members should avoid the ten kinds of offenses. [aside:] You have got the ten kinds of offenses? So first offense is to blaspheme great personalities who are engaged in glorifying the Lord within this material world. And, //śruti-śāstra-nindanam,// and to decry the Vedic literature. And third, to interpret the holy name in different way according to our own whims. This is also offense. And the most dangerous offense is //namnaḥ balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhir// [//Padma Purāṇa, Brahma Khaṇḍa// 25.15–18]. Anyone who thinks that "I am chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// so I am becoming free from contamination of sinful life; therefore let me commit sinful life and counteract it by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa," this is the greatest offense. We should not commit offenses on the strength of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// And then considering the different names of the demigods, they are independent---no. The Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's name, Viṣṇu's name, is supreme; it cannot be equalized with other names. And, in spite of chanting the holy name, if one is attached to material enjoyment, that is also offense. And to instruct about the glories of the name to a person who is out of the jurisdiction of devotional service... Of course, sometimes we have to do this, but that is for preaching sake. But generally we should not do that. I think these ten kinds of offenses are there. Anything more?

**Satsvarūpa:**
To take the chanting as auspicious material ritual.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Śubha-karma.// Just like to..., there are many auspicious activities to counteract inauspicious activities. So this chanting of holy name should not be taken as that. It is just for the matter of pleasing the Absolute Personality of Godhead. So, you chant //mantra.// Hmm.
