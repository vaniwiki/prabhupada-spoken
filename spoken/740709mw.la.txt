====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Now if they say that the killing means murdering, that means the people amongst whom Christ was preaching, they were accustomed to kill men. So what class of men they are? What was the society? A society of murderers. So what they will understand about religion, a murderer?

[pause] So go further or return?

**Jayatīrtha:**
We should probably turn around now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [pause] If you're preaching honesty to a thief, you have to be careful that he's not stealing your watch in the meantime.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayatīrtha:**
If you're preaching honesty to a thief, he may steal your watch. So Jesus was trying to teach religion to murderers, so they murdered him.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes. //Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopāya na śāntaye.// [aside:] Don't come very near. If you advise rascals, they'll be angry. No good result. //Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopāya na śāntaye, payaḥ-pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa-vardhanam// [//Hitopadeśa// 3.4]. So we have to become very strong preacher. Then this movement will stay. If you simply take the temple worship, it will not stay very long. Just like...

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Especially the leaders must preach.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Especially the leaders must preach.

**Prabhupāda:**
And leaders means... If the leaders are good, then it will continue.

**Bali-mardana:**
If they are not preaching, they are not leaders. They are bogus. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Leaders means they should behave in such a way so that by following them, others will be benefited. That is leader.

**Jayatīrtha:**
That's a perfect definition, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayatīrtha:**
That's a perfect definition. That should be in the dictionary, like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. What is that perfect definition?

**Jayatīrtha:**
The... A leader means one that if someone follows him, he's benefited.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is leader.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Look out.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Look out. Oh, the ocean is coming.

**Prabhupāda:**
Our Juhu Beach is better than... Best in the world. You have not seen?

**Jayatīrtha:**
I was there. Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's very beautiful.

**Gurukṛpa:**
What do you think of Jagannātha Purī beach?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not so nice.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Not so nice?

**Prabhupāda:**
Juhu Beach is very nice. You can go up to one mile, so much water.

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Up to the knee.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Just up to the knee?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And the waves are not so ferocious it is coming. And the whole thing is clean, whole beach. Yes. And it is ten miles long. Therefore so many foreigners' hotels are there. [//japa//] [pause] When I was last here, Los Angeles, which chapter I was reading? Who knows? Which chapter of //Bhāgavata// I was reading?

**Gurukṛpa:**
Fifth?

**Sudāmā:**
The last time he was here?

**Jayatīrtha:**
In Los Angeles you were reading in the Third Volume of the First Canto. I believe it was about...

**Hṛdayānanda:**
About Arjuna, how Arjuna left the earth, how the Pāṇḍavas retired.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Ah, "Pāṇḍavas Retire," yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So from there we shall begin again. [//japa//]

[long pause]

If the people refuse to take Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they'll never be happy. This is a fact. [pause] But if you present properly, they will take. That is a fact. The other day in San Francisco, there were about twelve to fifteen thousand men. They were hearing so patiently. They also applauded. And many came to my car, "Thank you, Prabhupāda. Thank you, Prabhupāda. Thank you, Prabhupāda." Said like that.

**Bali-mardana:**
I've never seen so many young Americans sit for..., listen to the lecture so attentively.

**Prabhupāda:**
And religious, most dry subject. Not cinema.

**Bali-mardana:**
The newspaper said that it was the most favorite festival of all San Francisco, of all the festivals.

**Prabhupāda:**
So they have mentioned, "American Hindus." [chuckles] [pause] It is a dead blow to the material civilization: "No drinking and no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling, no illicit sex." Their whole civilization is finished. Because they stand on these things, four pillars.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have no other...

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
Therefore we must present a better civilization.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
We must present a better civilization.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Not better or best. //The// civilization. Everything is all false, cheating. Everything, everything is cheating. Without this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all other consciousness, they're simply cheating. That is called //māyā,// illusion. If you remain in any other consciousness except Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that means you are in illusion. You are misguided. That is explained in the second verse of the First Canto. //Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vāstava vastu vedyam atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]: "All kinds of cheating religious system is kicked out." That is the second verse. //Projjhita,// completely cleansed of all cheating type of religion. This, this has been translated into Bengali by these words,

> pṛthivīte yāha kichu dharma nāme cale
> bhāgavata kāhe taha paripūrṇa chale
> [Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura]

Whatever is going on throughout the whole world in the name of religion, //Bhāgavata,// according to //Bhāgavata,// they're all cheating. They're all cheating. //Bhāgavata kāhe taha paripūrṇa chale. Chale// means cheating.

**Jayatīrtha:**
What exactly is the definition of a cheat?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayatīrtha:**
What is the definition of a cheat?

**Prabhupāda:**
Cheat means that I am exploiting you. I am saying that I am creating you a religious, but you are most sinful; I am creating a most sinful. That is cheating.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Giving something under false pretensions.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. You are taking something else while thinking something else. That is cheating. Actually, we see the so-called religious system... Religion means to become lover of God. But who is lover of God? Do not know what is God, and what to speak of love Him. They do not know, have no clear conception of God even.

**Jayatīrtha:**
They are lovers of dog.

**Prabhupāda:**
And actually they are lovers of dog. And still, he's professing, "I am religious." This is not cheating.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes, it's cheating. Imposter.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. Unless one becomes a devotee of God, there is no question of religion. It is all cheating. By opening hospital, schools... There are thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of years, the hospitals and schools are being opened, philanthropy. What is the result?

**Bali-mardana:**
Atom bombs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Atom bomb. Result is atom bomb.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
You're the only one, Prabhupāda, who dares to criticize hospitals and schools. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So many people came to request me... Even Dr. Ghosh. Eh? You know.

**Satsvarūpa:**
He wanted you to open a medical dispensary.

**Prabhupāda:**
"No, no, we are not going to waste our time in that way." I frankly told him. We have no extra time to waste like that. What he thinks very big project, we say it is waste of time. [laughter]

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Jaya.// It is a completely revolutionary idea.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I cannot allow anyone he's waste his valuable time of human life.

**Gurukṛpa:**
You said before that the more hospitals they open, that means the more people have to become sick.

**Prabhupāda:**
That, more... Yes.

**Gurukṛpa:**
To get in the hospital.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are very much proud, "We have opened fifty hospitals." That means fifty thousand people have become sick. "We have increased so many beds." That means so many people have more increased their disease. But they're proud of doing this. Our poor-feeding and their poor-feeding is different. We give //prasādam//---by eating he'll become Kṛṣṇa-ized. He'll become a devotee. And ordinary eating means he will eat and go to hell. Hare Kṛṣṇa [//japa//] //Kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau...//

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda.

**Jayatīrtha:**
//Jāyate.// All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
