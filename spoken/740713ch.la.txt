His later pastimes [the madhya-līlā and antya-līlā] were recorded in the form of notes by His secretary, Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī, and thus kept within a book.

> śiṣyera pratīta haya,---prabhāva āścarya

When teaching a course in grammar [vyākaraṇa] and explaining it with notes, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught His disciples about the glories of Lord Kṛṣṇa. All explanations culminated in Kṛṣṇa, and His disciples would understand them very easily. Thus His influence was wonderful.

/* TEXT 30 */
> yāre dekhe, tāre kahe,---kaha kṛṣṇa-nāma
> kṛṣṇa-nāme bhāsāila navadvīpa-grāma

When Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a student, He asked whomever He met to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra. In this way He inundated the whole town of Navadvīpa with the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa.

/* TEXT 31 */
> kiśora vayase ārambhilā saṅkīrtana
> rātra-dine preme nṛtya, saṅge bhakta-gaṇa

Just prior to His youthful life, He began the saṅkīrtana movement. Day and night He used to dance in ecstasy with His devotees.

> nagare nagare bhrame kīrtana kariyā
> bhāsāila tri-bhuvana prema-bhakti diyā

The saṅkīrtana movement went on from one part of the town to another, as the Lord wandered everywhere performing kīrtana. In this way He inundated the whole world by distributing love of Godhead.

/* TEXT 33 */

> laoyāilā sarva-loke kṛṣṇa-prema-nāme

Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived in the Navadvīpa area for twenty-four years, and He induced every person to chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra and thus merge in love of Kṛṣṇa.

/* TEXT 34 */

For His remaining twenty-four years, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, after accepting the renounced order of life, stayed at Jagannātha Purī with His devotees.

For six of these twenty-four years in Nīlācala [Jagannātha Purī], He distributed love of Godhead by always chanting and dancing.

Beginning from Cape Comorin and extending through Bengal to Vṛndāvana, during these six years He toured all of India, chanting, dancing and distributing love of Kṛṣṇa.

> śeṣa aṣṭādaśa varṣa---‘antya-līlā’ nāma

The activities of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu in His travels after He accepted sannyāsa are His principal pastimes. His activities during His remaining eighteen years are called the antya-līlā, or the final portion of His pastimes.

/* TEXT 38 */

> prema-bhakti laoyāila nṛtya-gīta-raṅge

> premāvasthā śikhāilā āsvādana-cchale

For the remaining twelve years He stayed in Jagannātha Purī, He taught everyone how to taste the transcendental mellow ecstasy of love of Kṛṣṇa by tasting it Himself.

/* TEXT 40 */
> rātri-divase kṛṣṇa-viraha-sphuraṇa
> unmādera ceṣṭā kare pralāpa-vacana

Day and night Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu felt separation from Kṛṣṇa. Manifesting symptoms of this separation, He cried and talked very inconsistently, like a madman.

/* TEXT 41 */
> śrī-rādhāra pralāpa yaiche uddhava-darśane
> seimata unmāda-pralāpa kare rātri-dine

As Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī talked inconsistently when She met Uddhava, so also Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu relished, both day and night, such ecstatic talk in the mood of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī.

/* TEXT 42 */
> vidyāpati, jayadeva, caṇḍīdāsera gīta
> āsvādena rāmānanda-svarūpa-sahita

The Lord used to read the books of Vidyāpati, Jayadeva and Caṇḍīdāsa, relishing their songs with His confidential associates like Śrī Rāmānanda Rāya and Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī.

/* TEXT 43 */
> kṛṣṇera viyoge yata prema-ceṣṭita
> āsvādiyā pūrṇa kaila āpana vāñchita

In separation from Kṛṣṇa, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu relished all these ecstatic activities, and thus He fulfilled His own desires.

/* TEXT 44 */
> ananta caitanya-līlā kṣudra jīva hañā
> ke varṇite pāre, tāhā vistāra kariyā

The pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu are unlimited. How much can a small living entity elaborate about those transcendental pastimes?

/* TEXT 45 */
> sūtra kari’ gaṇe yadi āpane ananta
> sahasra-vadane teṅho nāhi pāya anta

If Śeṣa Nāga Ananta personally were to make the pastimes of Lord Caitanya into sūtras, even with His thousands of mouths there is no possibility that He could find their limit.

/* TEXT 46 */
> dāmodara-svarūpa, āra gupta murāri
> mukhya-mukhya-līlā sūtre likhiyāche vicāri’

Devotees like Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara and Murāri Gupta have recorded all the principal pastimes of Lord Caitanya in the form of notes, after deliberate consideration.

/* TEXT 47 */
> sei, anusāre likhi līlā-sūtragaṇa
> vistāri’ varṇiāchena tāhā dāsa-vṛndāvana

The notes kept by Śrī Svarūpa Dāmodara and Murāri Gupta are the basis of this book. Following those notes, I write of all the pastimes of the Lord. The notes have been described elaborately by Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura.

/* TEXT 48 */
> caitanya-līlāra vyāsa,---dāsa vṛndāvana
> madhura kariyā līlā karilā racana

Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura, the authorized writer of the pastimes of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is as good as Śrīla Vyāsadeva. He has described the pastimes in such a way as to make them sweeter and sweeter.

/* TEXT 49 */
> grantha-vistāra-bhaye chāḍilā ye ye sthāna
> sei sei sthāne kichu kariba vyākhyāna

Being afraid of his book’s becoming too voluminous, he left some places without vivid descriptions. I shall try to fill those places as far as possible.

> tāṅra bhukta-śeṣa kichu kariye carvaṇa

The transcendental pastimes of Lord Caitanya have actually been relished by Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura. I am simply trying to chew the remnants of food left by him.

/* TEXT 51 */
> ādi-līlā-sūtra likhi, śuna, bhakta-gaṇa
> saṅkṣepe likhiye samyak nā yāya likhana

My dear devotees of Lord Caitanya, let me now write a synopsis of the ādi-līlā; I write of these pastimes in brief because it is not possible to describe them in full.

/* TEXT 52 */
> kona vāñchā pūraṇa lāgi’ vrajendra-kumāra
> avatīrṇa haite mane karilā vicāra

To fulfill a particular desire within His mind, Lord Kṛṣṇa, Vrajendra-kumāra, decided to descend to this planet after mature contemplation.

/* TEXT 53 */
> āge avatārilā ye ye guru-parivāra
> saṅkṣepe kahiye, kahā nā yāya vistāra

Lord Kṛṣṇa therefore first allowed His family of superiors to descend to the earth. I shall try to describe them in brief because it is not possible to describe them fully.

/* TEXTS 54–55 */
> śrī-śacī-jagannātha, śrī-mādhava-purī
> keśava bhāratī, āra śrī-īśvara purī
> advaita ācārya, āra paṇḍita śrīvāsa
> ācāryaratna, vidyānidhi, ṭhākura haridāsa

Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, before appearing as Lord Caitanya, requested these devotees to precede Him: Śrī Śacīdevī, Jagannātha Miśra, Mādhavendra Purī, Keśava Bhāratī, Īśvara Purī, Advaita Ācārya, Śrīvāsa Paṇḍita, Ācāryaratna, Vidyānidhi and Ṭhākura Haridāsa.

/* TEXT 56 */
> śrīhaṭṭa-nivāsī śrī-upendra-miśra-nāma
> vaiṣṇava, paṇḍita, dhanī, sad-guṇa-pradhāna

There was also Śrī Upendra Miśra, a resident of the district of Śrīhaṭṭa. He was a great devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, a learned scholar, a rich man and a reservoir of all good qualities.

/* TEXTS 57–58 */
> sapta miśra tāṅra putra---sapta ṛṣīśvara
> kaṁsāri, paramānanda, padmanābha, sarveśvara
> jagannātha, janārdana, trailokyanātha
> nadīyāte gaṅgā-vāsa kaila jagannātha

Upendra Miśra had seven sons, who were all saintly and most influential: (1) Kaṁsāri, (2) Paramānanda, (3) Padmanābha, (4) Sarveśvara, (5) Jagannātha, (6) Janārdana and (7) Trailokyanātha. Jagannātha Miśra, the fifth son, decided to reside on the bank of the Ganges at Nadia.

/* TEXT 59 */
> jagannātha miśravara---padavī ‘purandara’
> nanda-vasudeva-rūpa sadguṇa-sāgara

Jagannātha Miśra was designated as Purandara. Exactly like Nanda Mahārāja and Vasudeva, he was an ocean of all good qualities.

/* TEXT 60 */
> tāṅra patnī ‘śacī’-nāma, pativratā satī
> yāṅra pitā ‘nīlāmbara’ nāma cakravartī

His wife, Śrīmatī Śacīdevī, was a chaste woman highly devoted to her husband. Śacīdevī’s father’s name was Nīlāmbara, and his surname was Cakravartī.

/* TEXT 61 */
> rāḍhadeśe janmilā ṭhākura nityānanda
> gaṅgādāsa paṇḍita, gupta murāri, mukunda

In Rāḍhadeśa, the part of Bengal where the Ganges is not visible, Nityānanda Prabhu, Gaṅgādāsa Paṇḍita, Murāri Gupta and Mukunda took birth.

/* TEXT 62 */
> asaṅkhya bhaktera karāilā avatāra
> śeṣe avatīrṇa hailā vrajendra-kumāra

Lord Kṛṣṇa, Vrajendra-kumāra, first caused countless devotees to appear, and at last He appeared Himself.

/* TEXT 63 */
> prabhura āvirbhāva-pūrve yata vaiṣṇava-gaṇa
> advaita-ācāryera sthāne karena gamana

Before the appearance of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the devotees of Navadvīpa used to gather in the house of Advaita Ācārya.

/* TEXT 64 */
> gītā-bhhāgavata kahe ācārya-gosāñi
> jñāna-karma nindi’ kare bhaktira baḍāi

In these meetings of the Vaiṣṇavas, Advaita Ācārya used to recite the Bhagavad-gītā and Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, decrying the paths of philosophical speculation and fruitive activity and establishing the superexcellence of devotional service.

/* TEXT 65 */
> sarva-śāstre kahe kṛṣṇa-bhaktira vyākhyāna
> jñāna, yoga, tapo-dharma nāhi māne āna

In all the revealed scriptures of Vedic culture, devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa is explained throughout. Therefore devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa do not recognize the processes of philosophical speculation, mystic yoga, unnecessary austerity and so-called religious rituals. They do not accept any process but devotional service.

/* TEXT 66 */
> tāṅra saṅge ānanda kare vaiṣṇavera gaṇa
> kṛṣṇa-kathā, kṛṣṇa-pūjā, nāma-saṅkīrtana

In the house of Advaita Ācārya, all the Vaiṣṇavas took pleasure in always talking of Kṛṣṇa, always worshiping Kṛṣṇa and always chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra.

/* TEXT 67 */
> kintu sarva-loka dekhi’ kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha
> viṣaye nimagna loka dekhi’ pāya duḥkha

But Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu felt pained to see all the people without Kṛṣṇa consciousness simply merging in material sense enjoyment.

/* TEXT 68 */
> lokera nistāra-hetu karena cintana
> kemate e saba lokera ha-ibe tāraṇa

Seeing the condition of the world, He began to think seriously of how all these people could be delivered from the clutches of māyā.

/* TEXT 69 */
> kṛṣṇa avatari’ karena bhaktira vistāra
> tabe ta’ sakala lokera ha-ibe nistāra

Śrīla Advaita Ācārya Prabhu thought, "If Kṛṣṇa Himself appears in order to distribute the cult of devotional service, then only will liberation be possible for all people."

/* TEXT 70 */
> kṛṣṇa avatārite ācārya pratijñā kariyā
> kṛṣṇa-pūjā kare tulasī-gaṅgājala diyā

With this consideration, Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, promising to cause Lord Kṛṣṇa to descend, began to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, with tulasī leaves and water of the Ganges.

/* TEXT 71 */
> kṛṣṇera āhvāna kare saghana huṅkāra
> huṅkāre ākṛṣṭa hailā vrajendra-kumāra

By loud cries He invited Kṛṣṇa to appear, and this repeated invitation attracted Lord Kṛṣṇa to descend.

/* TEXT 72 */
> jagannāthamiśra-patnī śacīra udare
> aṣṭa kanyā krame haila, janmi’ janmi’ mare

Before the birth of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, eight daughters took birth one after another from the womb of Śacīmātā, the wife of Jagannātha Miśra. But just after their birth, they all died.

/* TEXT 73 */
> apatya-virahe miśrera duḥkhī haila mana
> putra lāgi’ ārādhila viṣṇura caraṇa

Jagannātha Miśra was very unhappy at the death of his children one after another. Therefore, desiring a son, he worshiped the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu.

/* TEXT 74 */
> tabe putra janamilā ‘viśvarūpa’ nāma
> mahā-guṇavān teṅha---‘baladeva’-dhāma

After this, Jagannātha Miśra got a son of the name Viśvarūpa, who was most powerful and highly qualified because He was an incarnation of Baladeva.

/* TEXT 75 */
> baladeva-prakāśa---parama-vyome ‘saṅkarṣaṇa’
> teṅha---viśvera upādāna-nimitta-kāraṇa

The expansion of Baladeva known as Saṅkarṣaṇa in the spiritual world is the ingredient and immediate cause of this material cosmic manifestation.

/* TEXT 76 */
> tāṅhā ba-i viśve kichu nāhi dekhi āra
> ataeva ‘viśvarūpa’ nāma ye tāṅhāra

The gigantic universal form is called the Viśvarūpa incarnation of Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa. Thus we do not find anything within this cosmic manifestation except the Lord Himself.

/* TEXT 77 */
> naitac citraṁ bhagavati
> hy anante jagad-īśvare
> otaṁ protam idaṁ yasmin
> tantuṣv aṅga yathā paṭaḥ

"As the threads in a cloth spread both lengthwise and breadthwise, so the Supreme Personality of Godhead exists directly and indirectly within everything we see in this cosmic manifestation. This is not very wonderful for Him."

/* TEXT 78 */
> ataeva prabhu tāṅre bale, ‘baḍa bhāi’
> kṛṣṇa, balarāma dui---caitanya, nitāi

Because Mahā-saṅkarṣaṇa is the ingredient and efficient cause of the cosmic manifestation, He is present in every detail of it. Lord Caitanya therefore called Him His elder brother. The two brothers are known as Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma in the spiritual world, but at the present moment they are Caitanya and Nitāi. Therefore the conclusion is that Nityānanda Prabhu is the original Saṅkarṣaṇa, Baladeva.

/* TEXT 79 */
> putra pāñā dampati hailā ānandita mana
> viśeṣe sevana kare govinda-caraṇa

The husband and wife [Jagannātha Miśra and Śacīmātā], having gotten Viśvarūpa as their son, were very pleased within their minds. Because of their pleasure, they specifically began to serve the lotus feet of Govinda.

/* TEXT 80 */
> audda-śata chaya śake śeṣa māgha māse
> jagannātha-śacīra dehe kṛṣṇera praveśe

In the month of January in the year 1406 of the Śaka Era (A.D. 1485), Lord Kṛṣṇa entered the bodies of both Jagannātha Miśra and Śacī.

/* TEXT 81 */
> miśra kahe śacī-sthāne,---dekhi āna rīta
> jyotirmaya deha, geha lakṣmī-adhiṣṭhita

Jagannātha Miśra said to Śacīmātā, "I see wonderful things! Your body is effulgent, and it appears as if the goddess of fortune were now staying personally in my home.

/* TEXT 82 */
> yāhāṅ tāhāṅ sarva-loka karaye sammāna
> ghare pāṭhāiyā deya dhana, vastra, dhāna

"Anywhere and everywhere I go, all people offer me respect. Even without my asking, they voluntarily give me riches, clothing and paddy."

/* TEXT 83 */
> śacī kahe,---muñi dekhoṅ ākāśa-upare
> divya-mūrti loka saba yena stuti kare

Śacīmātā told her husband, "I see wonderfully brilliant human beings appearing in outer space, as if offering prayers."

/* TEXT 84 */
> jagannātha miśra kahe,---svapna ye dekhila
> jyotirmaya-dhāma mora hṛdaye paśila

Jagannātha Miśra then replied, "In a dream I saw the effulgent abode of the Lord enter my heart.

/* TEXT 85 */
> āmāra hṛdaya haite gelā tomāra hṛdaye
> hena bujhi, janmibena kona mahāśaye

"From my heart it entered your heart. I therefore understand that a great personality will soon take birth."

/* TEXT 86 */

/* TEXT 87 */

In this way the pregnancy approached its thirteenth month, but still there was no sign of the delivery of the child. Thus Jagannātha Miśra became greatly apprehensive.

/* TEXT 88 */
> nīlāmbara cakravartī kahila gaṇiyā
> ei māse putra habe śubha-kṣaṇa pāñā

Nīlāmbara Cakravartī [the grandfather of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu] then did an astrological calculation and said that in that very month, taking advantage of an auspicious moment, the child would take birth.

/* TEXT 89 */
> caudda-śata sāta-śake māsa ye phālguna

Thus in the year 1407 of the Śaka Era [A.D. 1486], in the month of Phālguna [February-March], in the evening of the full-moon day, the desired auspicious moment arrived.

/* TEXT 90 */
> siṁha-rāśi, siṁha-lagna, ucca graha-gaṇa

[According to the Jyotir-veda, or Vedic astrology, the auspicious birth moment is described as follows:] The moon was in Leo [the figure of the lion in the zodiac], Leo was the ascendant, several planets were strongly positioned, and the ṣaḍ-varga and aṣṭa-varga showed all-auspicious influences.

/* TEXT 91 */
> a-kalaṅka gauracandra dilā daraśana
> sa-kalaṅka candre āra kon prayojana

When the spotless moon of Caitanya Mahāprabhu became visible, what would be the need for a moon full of black marks on its body?

/* TEXT 92 */
> eta jāni’ rāhu kaila candrera grahaṇa
> ‘kṛṣṇa’ ‘kṛṣṇa’ ‘hari’ nāme bhāse tri-bhuvana

Considering this, Rāhu, the black planet, covered the full moon, and immediately vibrations of "Kṛṣṇa! Kṛṣṇa! Hari!" inundated the three worlds.

/* TEXT 93 */
> jaya jaya dhvani haila sakala bhuvana
> camatkāra haiyā loka bhāve mane mana

All people thus chanted the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra during the lunar eclipse, and their minds were struck with wonder.

/* TEXT 94 */
> jagat bhariyā loka bale---‘hari’ ‘hari’
> sei-kṣaṇe gaurakṛṣṇa bhūme avatari

When the whole world was thus chanting the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa in the form of Gaurahari advented Himself on the earth.

/* TEXT 95 */
> prasanna ha-ila saba jagatera mana
> ‘hari’ bali’ hinduke hāsya karaye yavana

The whole world was pleased. While the Hindus chanted the holy name of the Lord, the non-Hindus, especially the Muslims, jokingly imitated the words.

While all the ladies vibrated the holy name of Hari on earth, in the heavenly planets dancing and music were going on, for the demigods were very curious.

> jagabhari’ hari-dhvani haya

Thus by His causeless mercy the full moon, Gaurahari, rose in the district of Nadia, which is compared to Udayagiri, where the sun first becomes visible. His rising in the sky dissipated the darkness of sinful life, and thus the three worlds became joyful and chanted the holy name of the Lord.

At that time Śrī Advaita Ācārya Prabhu, in His own house at Śāntipura, was dancing in a pleasing mood. Taking Haridāsa Ṭhākura with Him, He danced and loudly chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa. But why they were dancing, no one could understand.

Seeing the lunar eclipse and laughing, Advaita Ācārya and Haridāsa Ṭhākura immediately went to the bank of the Ganges and bathed in the river in great jubilation. Taking advantage of the occasion of the lunar eclipse, Advaita Ācārya, by His mental strength, distributed various types of charity to the brāhmaṇas.

/* TEXT 101 */

When he saw that the whole world was jubilant, Haridāsa Ṭhākura, his mind astonished, directly and indirectly expressed himself to Advaita Ācārya: "Your dancing and distributing charity are very pleasing to me. I can understand that there is some special purpose in these actions."

/* TEXT 102 */

In this way all the devotees, wherever they were situated, in every city and every country, danced, performed saṅkīrtana and gave charity by mental strength on the plea of the lunar eclipse, their minds overwhelmed with joy.

No one could understand who was coming and who was going, who was dancing and who was singing. Nor could they understand one another’s language. Yet all unhappiness and lamentation were immediately dissipated, and people became all-jubilant. Thus Jagannātha Miśra was also overwhelmed with joy.

/* TEXT 108 */

The wife of Śrīvāsa Ṭhākura, whose name was Mālinī, accompanied by the wife of Candraśekhara [Ācāryaratna] and other ladies, came there in great happiness to worship the baby with paraphernalia such as vermilion, turmeric, oil, fused rice, bananas and coconuts.

Riding in a palanquin covered with cloth and accompanied by maidservants, Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī came to the house of Jagannātha Miśra, bringing with her many auspicious articles such as fresh grass, paddy, gorocana, turmeric, kuṅkuma and sandalwood. All these presentations filled a large basket.

When Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī came to the house of Śacīdevī, bringing with her many kinds of eatables, dresses and other gifts, she was astonished to see the newborn child, for she appreciated that except for a difference in color, the child was directly Kṛṣṇa of Gokula Himself.

/* TEXT 116 */

On the day the mother and son bathed and left the maternity home, Sītā Ṭhākurāṇī gave them all kinds of ornaments and garments and then also honored Jagannātha Miśra.

In this way mother Śacīdevī and Jagannātha Miśra, having obtained a son who was the husband of the goddess of fortune, had all their desires fulfilled. Their house was always filled with riches and grains. As they saw the beloved body of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, day after day their pleasure increased.

Jagannātha Miśra was an ideal Vaiṣṇava. He was peaceful, restrained in sense gratification, pure and controlled. Therefore he had no desire to enjoy material opulence. Whatever money came because of the influence of his transcendental son, he gave it in charity to the brāhmaṇas for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu.

/* TEXT 121 */

After calculating the birth moment of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nīlāmbara Cakravartī privately said to Jagannātha Miśra that he saw all the different symptoms of a great personality in both the body and birth moment of the child. Thus he understood that in the future this child would deliver all the three worlds.

In this way Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, out of His causeless mercy, made His advent in the house of Śacīdevī. Lord Caitanya is very merciful to anyone who hears this narration of His birth, and thus such a person attains the lotus feet of the Lord.

Anyone who attains a human body but does not take to the cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is baffled in his opportunity. Amṛtadhunī is a flowing river of the nectar of devotional service. If after getting a human body one drinks the water in a poison pit of material happiness instead of the water of such a river, it would be better for him not to have lived, but to have died long ago.
