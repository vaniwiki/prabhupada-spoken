====== Morning Walk at Marine del Rey ======

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
[introducing recording] Morning Walk, July 13th, 1974, in Marina del Rey. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...have discrimination because the British government, they think that the Ratha-yatra is becoming very popular.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the... It is actually rational discrimination. The Christians, they thought, "Now these Englishmen, they'll make Hindu religion very prominent." Because it is a fact. If we introduce such three, four celebration, then Christianity will be finished. But what is there? Christianity, there is nothing. Simply some dry words. And actually, they're seeing, nobody's coming to the church. So in this way, if they some..., relish something better, then whatever is there, that will be finished also. Therefore in London we wanted to purchase a church.

**Bali-mardana:**
A big cathedral.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. And they said, "We shall burn it down; still, we shall not give to Bhaktivedanta Swami." They said like that.

**Bahulāśva:**
Rascals.

**Prabhupāda:**
"We shall burn it down." They are seeing practically. After all, they are businessmen, "Shopkeepers' nation." They see practically that if such kind of movements go on... People are already have no interest in the church. In Chicago they wrote, "American Hindus." They wrote in the paper. Then Hindu, Hindu religion will be prominent.

**Bahulāśva:**
The Catholic Church is a very wealthy institution, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bahulāśva:**
The Catholic Church is very wealthy. They don't want to lose their...

**Prabhupāda:**
So what will wealth do? If it does not appeal to the people, what wealth will do? In Chicago also, the Christians came with some wooden signboard. You have seen?

**Bali-mardana:**
No, I didn't see.

**Prabhupāda:**
"It is through Christ. It is through..." They were showing me. So that has been criticized by the newspapermen, that "Nobody cares for you." [laughter] Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
In New York also, we have to do the negotiations very secretly, because if they find out, they would not want to sell to us. They would be afraid.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, New York, there was Ratha-yātrā?

**Bali-mardana:**
No, no. For purchasing the church.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Bali-mardana:**
They're also afraid that we will take over.

**Prabhupāda:**
But that is not yet finished.

**Bali-mardana:**
Well, it is going on now. The one building is finished. Other building is still... Until we are living there...

**Prabhupāda:**
That, one Japanese gentleman wrote in a paper that "This Movement, as it growing fast, within ten years the whole world will become Hindu."

**Bali-mardana:**
//Jaya.// [laughter] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So even it is as it is, they may take in palanquin, but there must be a protest meeting continuously. Protest meeting, and the Indians should approach the Ambassador that "Represent our case to the Queen, that Hindus are being harassed." This should be organized.

**Bali-mardana:**
And also in newspaper.

**Prabhupāda:**
Also newspaper. There must be...

**Bali-mardana:**
They can make advertisements in the newspaper.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That "On certain plea only, they have stopped our most important ceremony." In this way agitation must go on. And our men, those who took part in political agitation, they should go there and speak everywhere, that "It is religious discrimination."

**Bali-mardana:**
They should have a protest meeting in front of the Parliament building, with signs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Protest meeting must be there. How to organize? At least, a protest meeting should be done in such a way that the whole world may know that the British Government stopped the yearly Ratha-yātrā ceremony of the Hindus. That should be organized. What can be done? You are not very strong GBCs. There must be vehement protest meeting.

**Bali-mardana:**
They can protest in front of Downing Street, in front of the Prime Minister's residence.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, protest meeting, go on, organize. Go, all of you. What is the talking here? They have seen that the movement is growing more important. So this is discrimination. In England the Church is very strong. They have organized like this. You quote the publication, "There is no alarm." Of course, it is on the plea of police protest, police objection. The police objection means one's religious ceremony should be stopped? What is this? Simply for some technical mistake, now they can warn that "You must do it. Otherwise it will be stopped." How is that? No. That means this is police government? Does it mean it is police government?

**Bali-mardana:**
Police state.

**Prabhupāda:**
Police state? And why they are declaring Commonwealth, or British Commonwealth? So if it is governed by the police, how it is Commonwealth? There should be very strong agitation. And all the Hindus will join. So who will organize it? Don't make it childish. It is very serious. [pause] Police should have taken task when the rules were broken by Mahādeva. Why they did not take action in that time? They did not say anything. Police, if there is discrepancy, violation of the rules, they should have taken immediate action. Why they did not take? Now they have manufactured by conspiracy that "This movement should be stopped. Now take this plea." This is going on.

**Bali-mardana:**
They could even have been paid off.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bali-mardana:**
Perhaps they were also paid off to stop it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Paid off or not paid off, it doesn't matter. But actually it is stopped. And if we simply cede, then there is no future hope of this movement. Better, in spite of their "No" order, we shall take the...

**Bali-mardana:**
Take the //ratha// there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bahulāśva:**
Take it anyway.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And let them be arrested. That is the real thing.

**Bali-mardana:**
That is better.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you go all there, and perform this.

**Bahulāśva:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [pause] Make the //ratha// as it is, and keep it on the Hyde Park. Don't move it, and hold meeting. Don't go the Trafalgar Square, but organize huge meeting there. Don't move it. "Under protest, we are not moving, but this is discrimination." Organize like that. Have the //ratha// standing there, unless the order is given. And go on holding meeting. That will be the right answer.

**Bali-mardana:**
They can bring the //ratha// in on a big truck.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ratha,// we start from the Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square. So the //ratha// must be there. We'll not move. And simply hold meeting, unless the order is given. This is the right course.

**Brahmānanda:**
They should have a meeting until the order is given.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "Until the order is given, we shall hold meeting here. Daily." And tell them that "It is..., it is police government. Then we should..., we shall give up British connection." Agitate government that "It has become a police government." Best course will be like that, that "As usual, we shall keep the //ratha// there. We are not moving." And hold on, go on protest meeting, daily. And keep them there. Let them arrest and go to jail. That is the real effort. [pause]

Or one thing do... //Satī sārthaṁ samācaret.// Therefore I wanted to start this politics. There say, "It is..., it is our custom. Unless the //ratha// is there, there is no ceremony. So you have asked to palanquin. We shall make the //ratha// here, standing. And after holding our ceremony we shall take the Deity in palanquin and go to the Trafalgar Square." And go to the Trafalgar Square and hold meeting there. But the //ratha// must be there. "It will not move. It will stand here. We shall take the Deities in palanquin and go to the Trafalgar Square." In this way, take police permission, and after going there, along with the ceremony, protest.

**Brahmānanda:**
In Trafalgar Square.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Trafalgar Square.

**Bali-mardana:**
They cannot object if the //ratha// is not moving.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's all. That "You, objection... Our //ratha// will not move. It will simply stand there. The Deity will go in palanquin to Trafalgar Square and come back." They cannot object. But the //ratha// must be seen. And people must know that the rascal police government has stopped it. Go, everyone, and do it. The //ratha// must be exhibited, even though it does not move. And the Deity will be moving in palanquin, and come back again to the //ratha.// Is that all right?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Can you execute all this?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do it. Ratha-yātrā //ratha// is there, but the police did not allow to move. That's all right. We shall not move. The Deities, three palanquin, taken together, procession will go to the Trafalgar... That is, that is allowed. But the //ratha// must be exhibited. It will not move. So what is their objection? If the //ratha// stands in the same place, without movement, then they cannot have any objection. As they have passed, the Deities will move, and we'll come back again. Is it any... Eh? What objection can...?

**Bali-mardana:**
That is approved for the route?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes, they can walk with the palanquins over the route, to the Trafalgar Square.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's all right.

**Bali-mardana:**
That's approved?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ratha// will not move. Then when we will get sanction, it will move. And for the sanction we must go on protesting. If you can take these steps, then do it. Otherwise, sleep. [break] ...with Haṁsadūta.

**Bali-mardana:**
I can talk to him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Talk with clear brain. The idea is given. [break] ...be able to do it alone, or we shall go. Or even if he does not say, you go and all organize. It is very important thing. And things are going not right there, and you shall sleep here. That is not good.

**Bali-mardana:**
So shall we also make protests?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, first of all organize this. Then we shall protest.

**Bali-mardana:**
Protest at the meeting. At the meeting.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah. Don't say about protesting now.

**Bali-mardana:**
Now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Take this, tactfully, that "All right, our //ratha// will not move. But this is our ceremony. The //ratha// will stand there."

**Bali-mardana:**
So they should get written permission for the //ratha// to stand there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. "//Ratha// will stand, will not move, unless you sanction. But it is the..., one of the part of the ceremony. There must be //ratha.// How you can stop it?" And from the //ratha// the palanquin will go to the Trafalgar Square. As usual, we hold our ceremonies and come back. So what is the objection? And if they say, "No, you cannot even keep the //ratha,//" that means there is conspiracy.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means there is conspiracy. So we should be politicians also.

[break] ...somebody protested that "Your Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement makes the people dull." And now, you have not seen the Vaiṣṇava. There was two fight in the Indian history. One is Rāma and Rāvaṇa, and one is Kurukṣetra. And the hero is Vaiṣṇava. We are going to produce such Vaiṣṇavas, not these dull rascals, sitting down. We don't want these Vaiṣṇavas, sitting-down rascals. We want Arjuna or we want [indistinct]. That is Vaiṣṇava. That is wanted.

**Jayatīrtha:**
It's time to go back. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that if we remain rascals, then that Gaurasundara's example will be followed. One day you'll again become crazy and close up everything and smoke. That's all. My Guru Mahārāja used to say, //prāṇa arthe yāñra sei hetu pracāra:// "One who has got life, he can preach." The dead man cannot preach. So you become with life, not like dead man. Without life... Just like all my Godbrothers. They are dead men, and therefore they are envious of my activities. They have no life. If you want to make easy-going life, showing the Deity and then sleep, then it is a failure movement.

**Bahulāśva:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, I have given the solution. The //ratha// must be there. It may not move; that is another thing. It will stand. The Deity will move on palanquin accordingly. Take this sanction. And then, coming back, hold big meeting, protest meeting. //Ratha// must be there. It will not move. The movement will be by palanquin. I think... I don't think there is any difficulty. How there can be any objection? Reasonably? There cannot be any objection. Let the //ratha// stand there, and the Deity moves according to your sanction. What objection can be there?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Unless there's a conspiracy, there should be no objection.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. That will disclose their conspiracy. "We abide by your order that without your order our //ratha// will not move, go to the Trafalgar... That's all right. You have allowed palanquin. That's accepted." Do like that, tactfully. First of all, take the sanction. In America, in... They have appreciated, that Reverend Powell. No, there is no objection anywhere. Why this rascal, falling-down nation, British, they're objecting? //Apāt-kāle viparīta-buddhi.// They are falling down, they will commit offense and discrepancies more and more, so that they will be nowhere. I think after this Queen, this monarchy there, the so-called monarchy, will be also finished. Because her son, her husband, both of them are hippies. The Queen's husband and Queen's son, the Prince of Wales, both of them are hippies. So this monarchy will be also finished. [pause] What that Mahādeva is doing there in Africa?

**Brahmānanda:**
He's not doing very well.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's a rascal, and he was given in charge. Another rascal, Śyāmasundara. What he's doing, sitting and..., only?

**Brahmānanda:**
Just sitting and writing things that cannot be understood.

**Prabhupāda:**
Writing where?

**Brahmānanda:**
In the temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
And the other?

**Brahmānanda:**
He's doing all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let him stay there. Don't allow him to come out. Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
He was planning to leave any day.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he cannot go. Then "We shall charge you all theft charges."

**Brahmānanda:**
Which?

**Prabhupāda:**
Theft charges. He's, he stolen money, and he has stolen something in Bombay also.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Also, they still have so many debts from last year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayatīrtha:**
They still owe money for last year's festival, so many thousands.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is... And even somehow or other he goes out, then he should not be allowed strictly either in our..., this temple or that temple.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let him go to hell.

**Brahmānanda:**
Actually, he was planning to see Revatīnandana Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Brahmānanda:**
He was planning to go and visit Revatīnandana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, the Revatīnandana and this man and Śyāmasundara is making a clique. I can understand. What they are planning, that also I know. But I don't wish to disclose it. So if these things come, then how this movement will go on? Politics, diplomacy, fraud, cheating, these are the general qualification of the Western countries.

**Brahmānanda:**
Sitting?

**Prabhupāda:**
Politics, diplomacy, fraud, cheating. These things are the general qualification of the Western people. Do you admit or not?

**Devotees:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
If they are..., these things come within our movement, then it will not be successful. //Tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. One has to become purified. Even sometimes we have to take... But that is for Kṛṣṇa's. There must be now checking that all these rascals may not join and spoil the movement. You should not admit.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They can come and go.

**Bali-mardana:**
We should not make a haven for rascals.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bali-mardana:**
We should not create a haven for rascals.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So how it will be done unless you GBC members become very strong and with good brain? Now, first of all save this situation. This is only solution, as I have suggested, that "The //ratha// must be there. We are not moving." And take lawyers. And the Deity will be moved, and we'll come to the //ratha// and go back. That's all. And we shall abide by all the rules. That's all. They saw it that in open sunshine thousands of people, ten thousands of people or more than that, fifteen thousand people, they stood on the Trafalgar Square for three hours. And they do not go to the church. So they must have seen there is something. Otherwise, how people taken so much interest? And there is, actually.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. Just like in the San Francisco paper they admitted, "This is the most popular festival."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. San Francisco also, fifteen thousand people attended my lecture silently. So they are seeing now there is something in this movement, and if this movement, it is allowed to go on without any objection, then Christianity will be finished. That is the conspiracy behind it. That lecture is recorded? The..., which I gave in the, that society of the priests and...

**Satsvarūpa:**
The fathers?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes, fine...

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can hear that lecture, how it was. They appreciated so much. We have no disrespect for Christianity. [pause] At least, expose our so-called Indian ambassador and others... Approach them, that "Help us. What is this? What for you are here?" Even they do not allow by agitation, make the movement very important. Make profit this side or that side. That is businessman. The businessman makes profit when the price is going down and when the price is going up. They make their profit. That is businessman. Just like our Tripurāri, he goes on selling his book in any condition. He finds out some means how to sell in this condition. And this is intelligence, how to deal in different circumstances and make profit. That is brain. And if you make condition, "If these conditions are there, then I can make business," that is foolishness.

**Brahmānanda:**
You told me that when I came from Pakistan to India. I was complaining how difficult it was, but you said that a businessman makes profit in any circumstance.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is business. They are... Police has no eyes to see that the Bal-Krishna [Guru Maharaji] is regularly cheating. Any man can understand.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no stoppage of that here. Yes. And here, stoppage. Just see. It is clear conspiracy. It is not that police. Police cannot be so powerful that he can stop. If there was any discrepancy, why did not they take step, that "You have done... You have violated the rules"? They should have prosecuted us. Now, without saying anything at that time, now want to stop it.

**Jayatīrtha:**
It's just their tactic.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is tactic. They're factually seeing that "These people, they have brought some Jagannātha, and thousands of people following it. And nobody's coming to our church?" It is very commonsense thing. The church has being closed. And all the young men, they are joining. Not old men, old fools. No. All young, flourishing young men are joining. So they want to stop it now. [pause] Take it. [break]

**Madhukāṇṭa:**
...regard, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that we are making counter-propaganda against //māyā,// and that //māyā// will make propaganda very strong.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Madhukāṇṭa:**
So we must become very sincere devotees or...

**Prabhupāda:**
Unless we are very sincere, we cannot cope with //māyā.// That is not possible. If you remain a servant of //māyā,// you cannot conquer over //māyā.// You must be very sincere servant of Kṛṣṇa. Then you can conquer. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. It is clearly said. Otherwise, you are subjected to the tricks of //māyā.//

**Bahulāśva:**
Unless one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you can get rid of //māyā's// tricks. Otherwise, you may dress yourself like anything, but you are simply //māyā's// servant. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung one... //Ei ota kalir chelā:// "Here is another disciple of Kali." //Nake tilaka galai mālā.// "He has got //tilaka// on the nose and //mālā, kaṇṭhī,// also." //Sahaja bhajana kache namu saṅge laiyā pare bhalo//[?]: "And he's..., he has become a Vaiṣṇava by illicit sex." This is stated by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. "Here is a Kali's //chelā.// He has dressed like a Vaiṣṇava, but he is doing his //bhajan// with illicit sex." //Sahaje bhajana kache mamu saṅge lana pare bhalo.// You know? There is a class of //sahajiyās?//

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Vaiṣṇavas. Just like, dress like Rūpa Gosvāmī, loincloth and..., but three dozen women behind him.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, //gopīs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura: "Here is a disciple of Kali. He has //tilaka// and he has //kaṇṭhī// and he's doing this nonsense." //Eita kalir chela.// [pause]

**Bahulāśva:**
So the purport is that one must strictly follow the principles?

**Prabhupāda:**
You do not understand that?

**Bahulāśva:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are asking after twelve thousand years? I am speaking always that, and still you are questioning?

**Bali-mardana:**
Should I call immediately, or wait till after class?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bali-mardana:**
Should I call Haṁsadūta immediately, or wait until after class?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is, you use your discrimination. What I can say?

**Kṛṣṇa-kānti:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
