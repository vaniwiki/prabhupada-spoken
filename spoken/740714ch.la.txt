===== Lord Caitanya’s Childhood Pastimes =====

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ādi-līlā// 14th Chapter

/* TEXT 1 */
> kathañcana smṛte yasmin
> duṣkaraṁ sukaraṁ bhavet
> vismṛte viparītaṁ syāt
> śrī-caitanyaṁ namāmi tamc

Things that are very difficult to do become easy to execute if one somehow or other simply remembers Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. But if one does not remember Him, even easy things become very difficult. To this Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu I offer my respectful obeisances.

/* TEXT 2 */
> jaya jaya śrī-caitanya, jaya nityānanda
> jayādvaitacandra, jaya gaura-bhakta-vṛnda

All glories to Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu and all the devotees of Lord Caitanya!

/* TEXT 3 */
> prabhura kahila ei janmalīlā-sūtra
> yaśodā-nandana yaiche haila śacī-putra

I have thus described in brief the advent of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who appeared as the son of mother Śacī exactly as Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Mother Yaśodā.

/* TEXT 4 */
> saṅkṣepe kahila janmalīlā-anukrama
> ebe kahi bālyalīlā-sūtrera gaṇana

I have already briefly spoken about the pastimes of His birth in chronological order. Now I shall give a synopsis of His childhood pastimes.

/* TEXT 5 */
> vande caitanya-kṛṣṇasya
> bālya-līlāṁ mano-harām
> laukikīm api tām īśa-
> ceṣṭayā valitāntarām

Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the childhood pastimes of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself. Although such pastimes appear exactly like those of an ordinary child, they should be understood as various pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

/* TEXT 6 */
> bālya-līlāya āge prabhura uttāna śayana
> pitā-mātāya dekhāila cihna caraṇa

In His first childhood pastimes the Lord turned upside down while lying on His bed, and thus He showed His parents the marks of His lotus feet.

/* TEXT 7 */
> gṛhe dui jana dekhi laghupada-cihna
> tāhe śobhe dhvaja, vajra, śaṅkha, cakra, mīna

When the Lord tried to walk, in His small footprints the specific marks of Lord Viṣṇu were visible, namely the flag, thunderbolt, conchshell, disc and fish.

/* TEXT 8 */
> dekhiyā doṅhāra citte janmila vismaya
> kāra pada-cihna ghare, nā pāya niścaya

Seeing all these marks, neither His father nor His mother could understand whose footprints they were. Thus struck with wonder, they could not understand how those marks could be possible in their home.

/* TEXT 9 */
> miśra kahe,---bālagopāla āche śilā-saṅge
> teṅho mūrti hañā ghare khele, jāni, raṅge

Jagannātha Miśra said, "Certainly child Kṛṣṇa is with the śālagrāma-śilā. Taking His childhood form, He is playing within the room."

/* TEXT 10 */
> sei kṣaṇe jāgi’ nimāi karaye krandana
> aṅke lañā śacī tāṅre piyāila stana

While mother Śacī and Jagannātha Miśra were talking, child Nimāi woke up and began to cry, and mother Śacī took Him on her lap and allowed Him to suck her breast.

/* TEXT 11 */
> stana piyāite putrera caraṇa dekhila
> sei cihna pāye dekhi’ miśre bolāila

While mother Śacī was feeding the child from her breast, she saw on His lotus feet all the marks that were visible on the floor of the room, and she called for Jagannātha Miśra.

/* TEXT 12 */
> dekhiyā miśrera ha-ila ānandita mati
> gupte bolāila nīlāmbara cakravartī

When Jagannātha Miśra saw the wonderful marks on the sole of his son, he became very joyful and privately called for Nīlāmbara Cakravartī.

/* TEXT 13 */
> cihna dekhi’ cakravartī balena hāsiyā
> lagna gaṇi’ pūrve āmi rākhiyāchi likhiyā

When Nīlāmbara Cakravartī saw those marks, he smilingly said, "Formerly I ascertained all this by astrological calculation and noted it in writing.

/* TEXT 14 */
> batriśa lakṣaṇa---mahāpuruṣa-bhūṣaṇa
> ei śiśu aṅge dekhi se saba lakṣaṇa

"There are thirty-two bodily marks that symptomize a great personality, and I see all those marks on the body of this child.

/* TEXT 15 */
> pañca-dīrghaḥ pañca-sūkṣmaḥ
> sapta-raktaḥ ṣaḍ-unnataḥ
> tri-hrasva-pṛthu-gambhīro
> dvātriṁśal-lakṣaṇo mahān

"‘There are thirty-two bodily symptoms of a great personality: five of his bodily parts are large, five fine, seven reddish, six raised, three small, three broad and three grave.’

/* TEXT 16 */
> nārāyaṇera cihna-yukta śrī-hasta caraṇa
> ei śiśu sarva loke karibe tāraṇa

"This baby has all the symptoms of Lord Nārāyaṇa on His palms and soles. He will be able to deliver all the three worlds.

/* TEXT 17 */
> ei ta’ karibe vaiṣṇava-dharmera pracāra
> ihā haite habe dui kulera nistāra

"This child will preach the Vaiṣṇava cult and deliver both His maternal and paternal families.

/* TEXT 18 */
> mahotsava kara, saba bolāha brāhmaṇa
> āji dina bhāla,---kariba nāma-karaṇa

"I propose to perform a name-giving ceremony. We should observe a festival and call for the brāhmaṇas because today is very auspicious.

/* TEXT 19 */
> sarva-lokera karibe ihaṅ dhāraṇa, poṣaṇa
> ‘viśvambhara’ nāma ihāra,---ei ta’ kāraṇa

"In the future this child will protect and maintain all the world. For this reason He is to be called Viśvambhara."

/* TEXT 20 */
> śuni’ śacī-miśrera mane ānanda bāḍila
> brāhmaṇa-brāhmaṇī āni’ mahotsava kaila

After hearing Nīlāmbara Cakravartī’s prediction, Śacīmātā and Jagannātha Miśra observed the name-giving festival in great joy, inviting all the brāhmaṇas and their wives.

/* TEXT 21 */
> tabe kata dine prabhura jānu-caṅkramaṇa
> nānā camatkāra tathā karāila darśana

After some days the Lord began to crawl on His knees, and He caused various wonderful things to be seen.

/* TEXT 22 */
> krandanera chale balāila hari-nāma
> nārī saba ‘hari’ bale,---hāse gaura-dhāma

The Lord caused all the ladies to chant the holy names of the Hare Kṛṣṇa mahā-mantra on the plea of His crying, and while they chanted the Lord would smile.

/* TEXT 23 */
> tabe kata dine kaila pada-caṅkramaṇa
> śiśu-gaṇe mili’ kaila vividha khelana

After some days the Lord began to move His legs and walk. He mixed with other children and exhibited various sports.

/* TEXT 24 */
> ekadina śacī kha-i-sandeśa āniyā
> bāṭā bhari’ diyā baila,---khāo ta’ basiyā

One day while the Lord was enjoying His playful sports with the other little children, mother Śacī brought a dish filled with fused rice and sweetmeats and asked the child to sit down and eat them.

/* TEXT 25 */
> eta bali’ gelā śacī gṛhe karma karite
> lukāñā lāgilā śiśu mṛttikā khāite

But when she returned to her household duties, the child hid from His mother and began to eat dirt.

/* TEXT 26 */
> dekhi’ śacī dhāñā āilā kari’ ‘hāya, hāya’
> māṭi kāḍi’ lañā kahe ‘māṭi kene khāya’

Seeing this, mother Śacī hastily returned and exclaimed, "What is this! What is this!" She snatched the dirt from the hands of the Lord and inquired why He was eating it.

/* TEXT 27 */
> kāndiyā balena śiśu,---kene kara roṣa
> tumi māṭi khāite dile, mora kibā doṣa

Crying, the child inquired from His mother, "Why are you angry? You have already given Me dirt to eat. What is My fault?

/* TEXT 28 */
> kha-i-sandeśa-anna yateka---māṭira vikāra
> eho māṭi, seha māṭi, ki bheda-vicāra

"Fused rice, sweetmeats and all other eatables are but transformations of dirt. This is dirt, that is dirt. Please consider. What is the difference between them?

/* TEXT 29 */
> māṭi---deha, māṭi---bhakṣya, dekhaha vicāri’
> avicāre deha doṣa, ki balite pāri

"This body is a transformation of dirt, and the eatables are also a transformation of dirt. Please reflect upon this. You are blaming Me without consideration. What can I say?"

/* TEXT 30 */
> antare vismita śacī balila tāhāre
> "māṭi khāite jñāna-yoga ke śikhāla tore

Astonished that the child was speaking Māyāvāda philosophy, mother Śacī replied, "Who has taught You this philosophical speculation that justifies eating dirt?"

/* TEXT 31 */
> māṭira vikāra anna khāile deha-puṣṭi haya
> māṭi khāile roga haya, deha yāya kṣaya

Replying to the Māyāvāda idea of the child philosopher, mother Śacī said, "My dear boy, if we eat earth transformed into grain, our body is nourished, and it becomes strong. But if we eat dirt in its crude state, the body becomes diseased instead of nourished, and thus it is destroyed.

/* TEXT 32 */
> māṭira vikāra ghaṭe pāni bhari’ āni
> māṭi-piṇḍe dhari yabe, śoṣi’ yāya pāni"

"In a waterpot, which is a transformation of dirt, I can bring water very easily. But if I poured water on a lump of dirt, the lump would soak up the water, and my labor would be useless."

/* TEXT 33 */
> ātma lukāite prabhu balilā tāṅhāre
> "āge kena ihā, mātā, nā śikhāle more

The Lord replied to His mother, "Why did you conceal self-realization by not teaching Me this practical philosophy in the beginning?

/* TEXT 34 */
> ebe se jānilāṅ, āra māṭi nā khāiba
> kṣudhā lāge yabe, tabe tomāra stana piba"

"Now that I can understand this philosophy, no more shall I eat dirt. Whenever I am hungry I shall suck your breast and drink your breast milk."

/* TEXT 35 */
> eta bali’ jananīra kolete caḍiyā
> stana pāna kare prabhu īṣat hāsiyā

After saying this, the Lord, smiling slightly, climbed on the lap of His mother and sucked her breast.

/* TEXT 36 */
> eimate nānā-chale aiśvarya dekhāya
> bālya-bhāva prakaṭiyā paścāt lukāya

Thus under various excuses the Lord exhibited His opulences as much as possible in His childhood, and later, after exhibiting such opulences, He hid Himself.

/* TEXT 37 */
> atithi-viprera anna khāila tina-bāra
> pāche gupte sei vipre karila nistāra

On one occasion the Lord ate the food of a brāhmaṇa guest three times, and later, in confidence, the Lord delivered that brāhmaṇa from material engagement.

/* TEXT 38 */
> core lañā gela prabhuke bāhire pāiyā
> tāra skandhe caḍi’ āilā tāre bhulāiyā

In His childhood the Lord was taken away by two thieves outside His home. The Lord, however, got up on the shoulders of the thieves, and while they were thinking they were safely carrying the child to rob His ornaments, the Lord misled them, and thus instead of going to their own home the thieves came back to the home of Jagannātha Miśra.

/* TEXT 39 */
> vyādhi-chale jagadīśa-hiraṇya-sadane
> viṣṇu-naivedya khāila ekādaśī-dine

Pretending to be sick, the Lord asked some food from the house of Hiraṇya and Jagadīśa on the Ekādaśī day.

/* TEXT 40 */
> śiśu saba laye pāḍā-paḍasīra ghare
> curi kari’ dravya khāya māre bālakere

As usual for small children, He learned to play, and with His playmates He went to the houses of neighboring friends, stealing their eatables and eating them. Sometimes the children fought among themselves.

/* TEXT 41 */
> śiśu saba śacī-sthāne kaila nivedana
> śuni’ śacī putre kichu dilā olāhana

All the children lodged complaints with Śacīmātā about the Lord’s fighting with them and stealing from the neighbors’ houses. Therefore sometimes she used to chastise or rebuke her son.

/* TEXT 42 */
> "kene curi kara, kene māraha śiśure
> kene para-ghare yāha, kibā nāhi ghare"

Śacīmātā said, "Why do You steal others’ things? Why do You beat the other children? And why do You go inside others’ houses? What do You not have in Your own house?"

/* TEXT 43 */
> śuni’ kruddha hañā prabhu ghara-bhitara yāñā
> ghare yata bhāṇḍa chila, phelila bhāṅgiyā

Thus rebuked by His mother, he Lord would go in anger to a room and break all the pots within it.

/* TEXT 44 */
> tabe śacī kole kari’ karāila santoṣa
> lajjita ha-ilā prabhu jāni’ nija-doṣa

Then Śacīmātā would take her son on her lap and pacify Him, and the Lord would be very much ashamed, admitting His faults.

/* TEXT 45 */
> kabhu mṛdu-haste kaila mātāke tāḍana
> mātāke mūrcchitā dekhi’ karaye krandana

Once the child, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, chastised His mother with His soft hand, and His mother pretended to faint. Seeing this, the Lord began to cry.

/* TEXT 46 */
> nārīgaṇa kahe,---"nārikela deha āni’
> tabe sustha ha-ibena tomāra jananī"

The neighboring ladies told Him, "Dear child, please bring a coconut from somewhere, and then Your mother will be cured."

/* TEXT 47 */
> bāhire yāñā ānilena dui nārikela
> dekhiyā apūrva haila vismita sakala

He then went outside the house and immediately brought two coconuts. All the ladies were astonished to see such wonderful activities.

/* TEXT 48 */
> kabhu śiśu-saṅge snāna karila gaṅgāte
> kanyāgaṇa āilā tāhāṅ devatā pūjite

Sometimes the Lord would go with other children to bathe in the Ganges, and the neighboring girls would also come there to worship various demigods.

/* TEXT 49 */
> gaṅgā-snāna kari’ pūjā karite lāgilā
> kanyāgaṇa-madhye prabhu āsiyā basilā

When the girls engaged in worshiping the different demigods after bathing in the Ganges, the young Lord would come there and sit down among them.

/* TEXT 50 */
> kanyāre kahe,---āmā pūja, āmi diba vara
> gaṅgā-durgā---dāsī mora, maheśa---kiṅkara

Addressing the girls, the Lord would say, "Worship Me, and I shall give you good husbands or good benedictions. The Ganges and goddess Durgā are My maidservants. What to speak of other demigods, even Lord Śiva is My servant."

/* TEXT 51 */
> āpani candana pari’ parena phula-mālā
> naivedya kāḍiyā khā’na---sandeśa, cāla, kalā

Without the permission of the girls, the Lord would take the sandalwood pulp and smear it on His own body, put the flower garlands on His neck, and snatch and eat all the offerings of sweetmeats, rice and bananas.

/* TEXT 52 */
> krodhe kanyāgaṇa kahe---śuna, he nimāñi
> grāma-sambandhe hao tumi āmā sabāra bhāi

All the girls became very angry at the Lord for this behavior. "Dear Nimāi," they told Him, "You are just like our brother in our village relationship.

/* TEXT 53 */
> āmā sabākāra pakṣe ihā karite nā yuyāya
> nā laha devatā sajja, nā kara anyāya

"Therefore it does not behoove You to act like this. Don’t take our paraphernalia for worship of the demigods. Don’t create a disturbance in this way."

/* TEXT 54 */
> prabhu kahe,---"tomā sabāke dila ei vara
> tomā sabāra bhartā habe parama sundara

The Lord replied, "My dear sisters, I give you the benediction that your husbands will be very handsome.

/* TEXT 55 */
> paṇḍita, vidagdha, yuvā, dhana-dhānyavān
> sāta sāta putra habe---cirāyu, matimān"

"They will be learned, clever and young and possess abundant wealth and rice. Not only that, but you will each have seven sons, who will all live long lives and be very intelligent."

/* TEXT 56 */
> vara śuni’ kanyā-gaṇera antare santoṣa
> bāhire bhartsana kare kari’ mithyā roṣa

Hearing this benediction from Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, all the girls were inwardly very happy, but externally, as is natural for girls, they rebuked the Lord under the pretense of anger.

/* TEXT 57 */
> kona kanyā palāila naivedya la-iyā
> tāre ḍāki’ kahe prabhu sakrodha ha-iyā

When some of the girls fled, the Lord called them in anger and advised them as follows:

/* TEXT 58 */
> yadi naivedya nā deha ha-iyā kṛpaṇī
> buḍā bhartā habe, āra cāri cāri satinī

"If you are miserly and do not give Me the offerings, every one of you will have an old husband with at least four co-wives."

/* TEXT 59 */
> ihā śuni’ tā-sabāra mane ha-ila bhaya
> kona kichu jāne, kibā devāviṣṭa haya

Hearing this supposed curse by Lord Caitanya, the girls, considering that He might know something uncommon or be empowered by demigods, were afraid that His curse might be effective.

/* TEXT 60 */
> āniyā naivedya tārā sammukhe dharila
> khāiyā naivedya tāre iṣṭa-vara dila

The girls then brought the offerings before the Lord, who ate them all and blessed the girls to their satisfaction.

/* TEXT 61 */
> ei mata cāpalya saba lokere dekhāya
> duḥkha kāro mane nahe, sabe sukha pāya

When this cunning behavior of the Lord with the girls became known to the people in general, it did not create misunderstandings among them. Rather, they enjoyed happiness in these dealings.

/* TEXT 62 */
> eka-dina vallabhācārya-kanyā ‘lakṣmī’ nāma
> devatā pūjite āila kari gaṅgā-snāna

One day a girl of the name Lakṣmī, the daughter of Vallabhācārya, came to the bank of the Ganges to take a bath in the river and worship the demigods.

/* TEXT 63 */
> tāṅre dekhi’ prabhura ha-ila sābhilāṣa mana
> lakṣmī citte prīta pāila prabhura darśana

Seeing Lakṣmīdevī, the Lord became attached to her, and Lakṣmī, upon seeing the Lord, felt great satisfaction within her mind.

/* TEXT 64 */
> sāhajika prīti duṅhāra karila udaya
> bālya-bhāvācchanna tabhu ha-ila niścaya

Their natural love for each other awakened, and although it was covered by childhood emotions, it became apparent that they were mutually attracted.

/* TEXT 65 */
> duṅhā dekhi’ duṅhāra citte ha-ila ullāsa
> deva-pūjā chale kaila duṅhe parakāśa

They both enjoyed natural pleasure in seeing each other, and under the pretext of demigod worship they manifested their feelings.

/* TEXT 66 */
> prabhu kahe, ‘āmā’ pūja, āmi maheśvara
> āmāre pūjile pābe abhīpsita vara’

The Lord told Lakṣmī, "Just worship Me, for I am the Supreme Lord. If you worship Me, certainly you will get the benediction you desire."

/* TEXT 67 */
> lakṣmī tāṅra aṅge dila puṣpa-candana
> mallikāra mālā diyā karila vandana

On hearing the order of the Supreme Lord, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Lakṣmī immediately worshiped Him, offering sandalwood pulp and flowers for His body, garlanding Him with mallikā flowers, and offering prayers.

/* TEXT 68 */
> prabhu tāṅra pūjā pāñā hāsite lāgilā
> śloka paḍi’ tāṅra bhāva aṅgīkāra kailā

Being worshiped by Lakṣmī, the Lord began to smile. He recited a verse from Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam and thus accepted the emotion she expressed.

/* TEXT 69 */
> saṅkalpo viditaḥ sādhvyo
> bhavatīnāṁ mad-arcanam
> mayānumoditaḥ so ‘sau
> satyo bhavitum arhati

"‘My dear gopīs, I accept your desire to have Me as your husband and thus worship Me. I wish your desire to be fulfilled because it deserves to be so.’"

/* TEXT 70 */
> ei-mata līlā kari’ duṅhe gelā ghare
> gambhīra caitanya-līlā ke bujhite pāre

After thus expressing their feelings to each other, Lord Caitanya and Lakṣmī returned home. Who can understand the grave pastimes of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu?

/* TEXT 71 */
> caitanya-cāpalya dekhi’ preme sarva jana
> śacī-jagannāthe dekhi’ dena olāhana

When the neighboring people saw the naughty behavior of Lord Caitanya, out of love for Him they lodged complaints with Śacīmātā and Jagannātha Miśra.

/* TEXT 72 */
> ekadina śacī-devī putrere bhartsiyā
> dharibāre gelā, putra gelā palāiyā

One day mother Śacī went to catch her son, wanting to rebuke Him, but He fled from the spot.

/* TEXT 73 */
> ucchiṣṭa-garte tyakta-hāṇḍīra upara
> basiyāchena sukhe prabhu deva-viśvambhara

Although He is the maintainer of the entire universe, once the Lord sat upon some rejected pots in the pit where the remnants of food were thrown, after the pots had been used for cooking.

/* TEXT 74 */
> śacī āsi’ kahe,---kene aśuci chuṅilā
> gaṅgā-snāna kara yāi’---apavitra ha-ilā

When mother Śacī saw her boy sitting on the rejected pots, she protested, "Why have You touched these untouchable pots? You have now become impure. Go and bathe in the Ganges."

/* TEXT 75 */
> ihā śuni’ mātāke kahila brahma-jñāna
> vismitā ha-iyā mātā karāila snāna

Hearing this, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu taught His mother about absolute knowledge. Although amazed by this, His mother forced Him to take a bath.

/* TEXT 76 */
> kabhu putra-saṅge śacī karilā śayana
> dekhe, divyaloka āsi’ bharila bhavana

Sometimes, taking her son with her, mother Śacī would lie down on her bed, and she would see that denizens of the celestial world had come there, filling the entire house.

/* TEXT 77 */
> śacī bale,---yāha, putra, bolāha bāpere
> mātṛ-ājñā pāiyā prabhu calilā bāhire

Once mother Śacī told the Lord, "Please go call Your father." Receiving this order from His mother, the Lord went out to call him.

/* TEXT 78 */
> calite caraṇe nūpura bāje jhanjhan
> śuni’ camakita haila pitā-mātāra mana

When the child was going out, there was a tinkling of ankle bells from His lotus feet. Hearing this, His father and mother were struck with wonder.

/* TEXT 79 */
> miśra kahe,---ei baḍa adbhuta kāhinī
> śiśura śūnya-pade kene nūpurera dhvani

Jagannātha Miśra said, "This is a very wonderful incident. Why is there a sound of ankle bells from the bare feet of my child?"

/* TEXT 80 */
> śacī kahe,---āra eka adbhuta dekhila
> divya divya loka āsi’ aṅgana bharila

Mother Śacī said, "I also saw another wonder. People were coming down from the celestial kingdom and crowding the entire courtyard.

/* TEXT 81 */
> kibā kolāhala kare, bujhite nā pāri
> kāhāke vā stuti kare---anumāna kari

"They made noisy sounds I could not understand. I guess they were offering prayers to someone."

/* TEXT 82 */
> miśra bale,---kichu ha-uk, cintā kichu nāi
> viśvambharera kuśala ha-uk,---ei mātra cāi

Jagannātha Miśra replied, "Never mind what it is. There is no need to worry. Let there always be good fortune for Viśvambhara. This is all I want."

/* TEXT 83 */
> eka-dina miśra putrera cāpalya dekhiyā
> dharma-śikṣā dila bahu bhartsanā kariyā

On another occasion, Jagannātha Miśra, seeing the mischievous acts of his son, gave Him lessons in morality after rebuking Him greatly.

/* TEXT 84 */
> rātre svapna dekhe,---eka āsi’ brāhmaṇa
> miśrere kahaye kichu sa-roṣa vacana

On that very night, Jagannātha Miśra dreamt that a brāhmaṇa had come before him speaking these words in great anger:

/* TEXT 85 */
> "miśra, tumi putrera tattva kichui nā jāna
> bhartsana-tāḍana kara,---putra kari’ māna"

"My dear Miśra, you do not know anything about your son. You think Him your son, and therefore you rebuke and chastise Him."

/* TEXT 86 */
> miśra kahe,---deva, siddha, muni kene naya
> ye se baḍa ha-uk mātra āmāra tanaya

Jagannātha Miśra replied, "This boy may be a demigod, a mystic yogī or a great saintly person. It doesn’t matter what He is, for I think He is only my son.

/* TEXT 87 */
> putrera lālana-śikṣā---pitāra sva-dharma
> āmi nā śikhāle kaiche janibe dharma-marma

"It is the duty of a father to educate his son in both religion and morality. If I do not give Him this education, how will He know of it?"

/* TEXT 88 */
> vipra kahe,---putra yadi daiva-siddha haya
> svataḥ-siddha-jñāna, tabe śikṣā vyartha haya

The brāhmaṇa replied, "If your son is a transcendental mystic boy with self-effulgent perfect knowledge, what is the use of your education?"

/* TEXT 89 */
> miśra kahe,---"putra kene nahe nārāyaṇa
> tathāpi pitāra dharma---putrera śikṣaṇa"

Jagannātha Miśra replied, "Even if my son is not a common man but Nārāyaṇa, still it is the duty of a father to instruct his son."

/* TEXT 90 */
> ei-mate duṅhe karena dharmera vicāra
> viśuddha-vātsalya miśrera, nāhi jāne āra

In this way Jagannātha Miśra and the brāhmaṇa discussed the principles of religion in the dream, yet Jagannātha Miśra was absorbed in unalloyed parental mellow and did not want to know anything else.

/* TEXT 91 */
> eta śuni’ dvija gelā hañā ānandita
> miśra jāgiyā ha-ilā parama vismita

Being very pleased, the brāhmaṇa left after talking with Jagannātha Miśra, and when Jagannātha Miśra awakened from his dream, he was very much astonished.

/* TEXT 92 */
> bandhu-bāndhava-sthāne svapna kahila
> śuniyā sakala loka vismita ha-ila

He related the dream to his friends and relatives, and every one of them was very much astonished to hear of it.

/* TEXT 93 */
> ei mata śiśu-līlā kare gauracandra
> dine dine pitā-mātāra bāḍāya ānanda
