====== Bhagavad-gītā 4.12 ======

**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṁ siddhiṁ
> yajanta iha devatāḥ
> kṣipraṁ hi mānuṣe loke
> siddhir bhavati karmajā
> [[books:bg:4:12|[Bg. 4.12]]]

"[Men in this world desire success in fruitive activities,] ...and therefore they worship the demigods. Quickly, of course, men get results from fruitive work in this world."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

> kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṁ siddhiṁ

Generally, people are //karmajā. Karmajā// means one who wants to enjoy the fruit of his labor. Everyone in this material world, they have come to enjoy. So therefore they are working so hard. We have seen in big, big cities, especially in the Western world, they are working very, very hard.

In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is said that //nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma.//

> nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma
> yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti
> na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam
> kleśada..., asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ
> [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]

People do not understand that because we have got this material body, the sufferings are there. We are spirit. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// We are all spirit soul. But somehow or other, some way or otherwise, we have contacted this material world, and we are bound up by our //karma,// or fruitive result of fruitive activities. And the result is this body. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur dehopapatti// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]].

We work in a certain way, in contamination with the modes of material nature, and we get different types of body. These are explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that why there are different types of body. Now we are sitting, say, one hundred men here. We have got different types of body. Not that everyone's body of the same type. Why? Why the scientists cannot reply this? But //Bhagavad-gītā// replies. What is the reply? The reply is //kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. We have got different types of body from different types of mother. So //kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya.// Mother means //yoni,// and father means //bīja. Yathā yoni yathā bījam// [[books:sb:6:1:54|[SB 6.1.54]]]. Our birth is taking place according to the mother and the father. //Yathā bījaṁ yathā yoni.// So we are getting different types of body, human body or animal body or demigod body. This is due to //kāraṇam.//

What is the reason? //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya.// We are associating with different modes of material nature by our //karma,// activities. Therefore there are division of //karma. Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. That is also creation of God, //cātur-varṇyam, guṇa-karma.// It is very subtle subject matter. According to //guṇa// and //karma,// we are getting bodies, and we are preparing also next body according to this //guṇa// and //karma.// So if we change our //guṇa// and //karma,// then we can again regain our spiritual body. This is the process. //Guṇa...// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is also advised, //traiguṇya-viṣayā vedā nistraiguṇyo bhavārjuna// [[books:bg:2:45|[Bg. 2.45]]]. We have to transcend the //guṇas,// the infection of these material qualities.

It is naturally happening. God's, I mean to say, machine is so perfect that it is automatically taking place. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]. //Śakti.// God's energy, Kṛṣṇa's energy, is so perfect that it is automatically being done. We have got some experience nowadays. The pilot is sitting in front of the airplane, and there are very fine electronic machine, and he's pushing one button, immediately the wings is working, and it is going down. It is..., it is very, mean, a delicate position in the air. A little mistake in the pushing of the button, the whole plane may be crashed. So nowadays scientists, they have invented so many fine machineries that it is working very nicely. We came from London to Bombay in eight hours. So this is very nice. But at the same time, we should appreciate that how much nice machinery are there which is conducting the whole cosmic activities.

So that is stated in the //Vedas,// that //parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate, svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca.// Kṛṣṇa's knowledge is so perfect. Kṛṣṇa says, //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. This nature's work is going on not whimsically, but under the guidance of pushing the button of Kṛṣṇa, by Kṛṣṇa. It is not going... Any scientist can understand that no machine, however nicely made, finely made, without pushing the button it cannot work. So the huge machinery of the cosmic manifestation, which is working so nicely and perfected, perfectly... Our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara has mentioned in his book very nicely. So... There must be some brain. All big, big scientists... Even Professor Einstein, he also admitted. So there is brain. That brain is Kṛṣṇa. That brain is Kṛṣṇa.

So people are working... In the previous verse we have discussed, //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Father. He's very loving father, so He has given freedom to His sons. We are all sons. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. //Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the //bīja-pradaḥ pitā.// Material nature is the mother." //Tāsāṁ yonir mahad brahma ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā.// So the original father is Kṛṣṇa, and mother is this material nature. So I am the soul, spirit soul, very minute position. My, my magnitude is very, very small. That is also given in the //śāstra: keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya,// one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair. That is my magnitude. So that //bīja,// that spiritual spark, is given by Kṛṣṇa, and the material nature, //kṣitir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca...// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. This body is..., in this way we have got.

So because we are now in the material world, we have got the propensity to enjoy, to exploit the resources of material nature. Kṛṣṇa has given us the opportunity. Therefore He said in the previous verse that //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. If you want... Because material nature is also Kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa's energy. Not Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's energy, there is no difference. That I have explained last night. Just like the fire and heat, that is the same quality. In the heat there is warmth, and the fire there is warmth. Still, the heat is not the fire. This is called inconceivable, simultaneously one and different. This is perfect philosophy. Everything is one with the Supreme, and at the same time it is different. This is perfect philosophy given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Acintya-bhedābheda-tattva.//

So here, in this material world, people are trying to enjoy. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṁ siddhim// [[books:bg:4:12|[Bg. 4.12]]]. Everyone is working very hard. Any business he is doing, he is praying, "O my Lord, give me the opportunity that I may get success in my business." So Kṛṣṇa is giving. That is also very nice. If a person, desiring some material profit, remembering Kṛṣṇa, that is also welcome. Welcome because he is not atheist. Atheist class men, even for material success, they do not pray to God. But theist class, one who has got background pious activities, he is called theist. An impious, sinful activities, or sinful man, cannot remember even God. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. //Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām// [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]. So to remember even God, even go to God in temple or mosque or church and pray to God, "Give me this benefit,"... Just like Christian way of worshiping is "O God, give us our daily bread." Hindus also go to temple and pray to God that "Give me some profit. I am very poor man." So Kṛṣṇa says that is also welcome. //Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna, ārto jijñā..., ārto...//

**Devotee:**
//Arthārthī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Arthārthī,// yes. //Ārto jijñāsur jñānī ca bharatarṣabha// [[books:bg:7:16|[Bg. 7.16]]]. This is not pure devotee, but they are pious. One who goes to the temple and prays to God for some material profit, they are also pious. They are not sinful. But those who are sinful, they do not go even to the temple. They think, "What is this temple nonsense? We shall earn money." Our present government is encouraging this method, that "Why should you go to temple and waste your time? If you want money, then take to industries, work hard like an ass, and you get money." That is the policy going on. But //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// says, "No, no, no, this is not good. To work so hard like dogs and hogs..." Especially //Śrīmad-Bhāgavata// has mentioned the word "hog," "pig." //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Viḍ-bhujām. Viṭ, viṭ// means stool. Stool---//bhujam,// "one who eats stool." That means the pigs. So they are working very hard, day and night, to find out where is stool. "How to eat? How to eat? How to def... How to sleep?" This is their philosophy.

But actually, human life is not meant for that purpose. And to reduce some work, sometimes we think that "Let me go to the temple. If God or some demigod becomes very pleased upon me, then quickly I shall get the benefit." That is mentioned here, //kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṁ siddhim.// This is also mentioned in the //Vedas,// that "If you want success in this line, then worship this demigod. If you want beautiful wife, then worship Umā. If you want..." They're all listed. I don't remember just now, but these are recommended. These are recommended. Therefore, according to Vedic system, if you worship some demigod for some particular purpose, that is recommended. But Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that //antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. //Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣām.// If you get some profit, material profit... You can get it very easily. Therefore it is said, //kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṁ siddhiṁ yajanta iha devatāḥ, kṣipraṁ hi mānuṣe loke.// Just like... That is the difference between worshiping Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the demigods. There are many examples. Just like Lord Śiva. One demon, or a devotee of Lord Śiva... But generally, we find in the //śāstras...// Just like Rāvaṇa. Rāvaṇa was a great devotee of Lord Śiva, recognized. But he's accepted as a demon, //rākṣasa.// Although he was a great devotee, Mahīśāsura... He was also a great devotee of Goddess Durgā, but it is described as //asura.//

So according to //śāstra// it is said there are two divisions of men: //deva// and //asura. Deva// means the devotee of the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. //Viṣṇu-bhaktaḥ bhaved daiva āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ// [//Padma Purāṇa].// So it is very interesting. By worshiping different demigods, we get immediate result. We immediate... Just like the [sic:] Bhasmāsura. He was a great devotee of Lord Śiva, and when he was..., Lord Śiva was perfectly worshiped, he wanted to give him some benediction, and he asked Lord Śiva that "Please give me this benediction that on the head of anyone, if I place my hand, immediately his head will be gone, vanished, vanquished." So Lord Śiva is known as Āśutoṣa. Āśutoṣa means very quickly, very easily he becomes pleased. That is Lord Śiva's great qualification. And if anyone wants anything, even it is very obnoxious, he grants, "All right, take it."

So Lord Śiva gave him the benediction, "Yes, your... I give you this benediction." So then he wanted to test it. So he said, "Sir, let me place my hand upon your head." [laughter] So Lord Śiva was in danger. You see? Then he went to Lord Viṣṇu, "Please save me. I... This man took benediction from me, and now he wants to place his hand upon my head." So //viṣṇu-māyā// is very intricate. So Lord Viṣṇu saved Lord Śiva and informed the devotee, "This is not possible. Why don't you test by touching your own head?" Then as soon as he placed his hand on his own head, his head was vanished.

So here the people want to take immediate some benefit by worshiping different demigods, but he does not know what is the result, neither the demigods know. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says... You'll find in the Eighth Chapter that, //antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. //Alpa-medhasa// means one whose brain substance is very small. This is very true. According to brain substance... What is called? Celebrum or something? The technical. Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Cerebrum.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Cerebrum.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I was student of psychology. Our professor, Dr. Urquhart, said that the brain, the biggest brain is, by practical psychology it has been tested, sixty-four ounce. And that is the highest brain substance. But for woman it is never more than thirty-six ounce. So they have tested all these practical psychologies.

So here the same word is used, that //alpa-medhasa.// It is very technical. //Alpa// means "very little" brain substance. Those who have got very little brain substance, they try like this. //Kāṅkṣantaḥ karmaṇāṁ siddhiṁ yajanta iha devatāḥ// [[books:bg:4:12|[Bg. 4.12]]]. "Why little brain substance? He's getting profit from the demigods." Then brain substance little means he does not know what is his actual aim of life. He does not know. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. Those who are trying to be happy within this material world, worshiping different types of demigods and taking benefit very soon, but he, because his brain substance is very little, he does not consider it that "How long I shall enjoy it? How long I shall enjoy it?"

Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]. Even if you, by activities, pious activities, or worshiping different demigods, you go to the Brahmaloka, where the standard of life is very, very great, life is also, duration of life, is very, very great, so that is not permanent. But our problem is that we are permanent, eternal, and we are trying to be happy in the nonpermanent condition of life. This is called less brain. My problem is that I am the spirit soul... //Nityaḥ śāśvataḥ.// I am eternal, //śāśvataḥ. Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. I do not die even after the annihilation of this body. Then where is my eternal body? This question should be raised by the human form of life. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// But instead of //athāto... Jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā. Jīvasya,// the only business is "How..., what is the aim of life, how I shall be eternally happy, how I shall get my eternal life." That is the problem. But they do not consider the real problem. They think, "Immediately I require some money. So let me worship Lord Śiva or Lord..., this, Goddess Durgā or Gaṇeśa or Sūrya..." There are so many, recommended. So that is condemned in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that //tad bhavaty alpa..., antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]].

But people are... They do not care. Of course, those who are worshiping demigods, apart from them, there are many atheists. They don't care for anything. They want simply sense enjoyment. But it is said that you can get some immediate profit by worshiping different demigods. That is all right. But that is not your permanent benefit. Because //karmaṇā,// you are creating... //Karmaṇāṁ siddhim.// You are getting some profit by your //karma,// fruitive //karma,// but you are creating another life. Another life. To enjoy the fruitive result of this //karma// you'll have to wait for next life. So next life means another material body. So another material body means another term of suffering, another chapter of suffering. That they do not understand.

Therefore Ṛṣabhadeva advising that "This is not good. Don't be engaged in //karma,// fruitive activities." If you be engaged in fruitive activities, //karma,// then you'll have to accept another material body. That may be a cat's body or dog's body or demigod's body or... Body you'll have to... But as soon as you have a material body, then you'll suffer. The... One who does not understand this philosophy, he's called //alpa-medhasa,// poor fund of knowledge. Poor fund of knowledge. Real problem is, as Kṛṣṇa says, //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]], that "I am implicated with this process of repetition of birth and death, and after birth, there is suffering, old age, disease." He does not consider it. He thinks, "This is natural." No, it is unnatural. One who does not understand this, he's //alpa-medhasa,// poor, poor fund of knowledge. So //Bhāgavatam// says, therefore, "All right, if you have got desire also to enjoy this material world, then..." //Bhāgavatam// says,

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta paramaṁ puruṣa
> [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]

This is the recommendation, that //akāmaḥ... Akāmaḥ// means devotee. A devotee has no desire.

Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. Materialistic persons, they, what they want? They want //dhanam,// riches, wealth, and many men to control. Someone wants big factory, someone wants to become political leader, follower, many followers, and so on, so on. //Janam.// So these are material desires. //Dhanam// means money, and //janam// means follower, either family or followers or leader, like that. //Dhanaṁ janam... Na dhanaṁ na janam...// Another is //sundarī,// wife, very beautiful wife. This is //karmajā. Karmīs,// they want these three things: money, and many men upon whom he can command... [Hindi:] //Kukumb, kukumb dena wala.// So, and very nice wife, quality wife. So Mahā..., Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, "No, no, I don't want these." This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. //Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. "No, I don't want." Then //mukti?// Take //mukti.// "No, no, that also I don't want." This is //bhakti. Bhakti// means he does not want anything. Wanting means //dharma karma...// What is called? //Dharmārtha-kāma-mokṣa// [[books:sb:4:8:41|[SB 4.8.41]]]. //Dharma, artha, kāma// and //mokṣa.//

People want to become religious, because they think... This is also fact. By becoming pious, religious, you get material happiness. That's a fact. //Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]]. Four things you can get by pious activities. You get birth in very nice family, aristocratic family, or //brāhmaṇa// family, //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya// family, or rich family, //janma,// or rich nation. I say, therefore, these Americans, that "You are born of this rich nation. That is also a result of pious activities." Because //janma... Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī.// And wealth also. The Americans have got immense wealth. That is also a result of pious activities. And //janmaiśvarya-śruta,// education. They have got the highest education. Now they are going..., trying to go to the moon planet. Or they have gone. That is education, scientific education. And //śrī,// they're beautiful also. All Americans... You have seen so many boys and girls here, they're beautiful also. This is not ordinary thing. This is due to pious activities. //Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī.//

Therefore I request them that "Materially, you have got all benediction. Now utilize this benediction for developing your dormant Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then you are perfect. Then you become perfect." So anywhere where these facilities are there, //janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī,// instead of going down to hell, let them utilize it for getting the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is perfection. Therefore //Bhāgavatam// says, //idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā, tapasaḥ..., ca buddhi-dattayoḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:22|[SB 1.5.22]]]---charity, intelligence. So anyone who has got all these assets, so how it should be utilized? //Avicyutaḥ arthaḥ,// infallible decision has been made. What is that? //Yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam:// "Just try to glorify the Supreme Lord." With your money, with your intelligence, with your power, with your influence---whatever you have got---education, departmental knowledge, try to glorify the Supreme Lord. Then it is perfect. And if you spoil it or simply sense gratification, the //Bhāgavata...,// Ṛṣabhadeva says, //na sādhu manye:// "Oh, this is not good. This is not good." "Why it is not good? I am enjoying life. Why it is not good?" No. He says, //na sādhu manye yata ātmanaḥ ayam asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:4|[SB 5.5.4]]]: "If you be engaged in these fruitive activities to enjoy this material world, then you'll have to accept another material body." //Karmaṇāṁ siddhim.// Another material body. And if you accept another material body, then you'll have to accept again death, again old age, again disease. So what is the benefit? That is not benefit.

Therefore //Bhāgavatam// says that even if you have got desire to enjoy this material world, still, you take shelter of Kṛṣṇa.

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta paramaṁ puruṣa 
> [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]

//Paramaṁ puruṣa. Puruṣottama. Paramaṁ puruṣa// or //Puruṣottama,// the same thing; it is differently placed only. So //Puruṣottama// is Kṛṣṇa. So if you have got some material desire, Kṛṣṇa will fulfill. But don't worship... //Yajanta iha devatāḥ. Iha devatāḥ. Iha// means this material world, //iha. Devatāḥ.// All these demigods, beginning from Brahmā. Brahmā, Śiva, Lord Śiva, all the //devatās,// Indra, Candra, Sūrya, they are all //iha devatāḥ.// They are also living entities like us. Not Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is not //jīva-tattva.// But Brahmā is //jīva-tattva.// So //iha,// the particular word is used here, //iha,// because as this material world will be finished, similarly, the different planetary systems occupied by the different demigods, they will be finished. And the demigods will be also finished. And you'll be also finished. Therefore it is called //iha. Iha. Yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vra...// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]].

So..., but your problem is eternal life. Why you should be engaged //iha devatāḥ?// Because //iha devatāḥ// means //iha// will be finished, your //devatā// will be finished, you'll be finished, everything will be finished. But your problem is how to come to the eternal point. That is stated also by Kṛṣṇa in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that //janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. Not //iha;// stand there, in the spiritual world. If you simply try to understand what is Kṛṣṇa, then the result will be that after giving up this body, no more material body. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti.// No more //punar janma.// That is required. But they do not understand it. They want quick result for some sense gratification, but implicate himself in the tangle, entanglement of getting again birth and death. That is going on. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the most beneficial welfare activities to the human society, because by awakening them to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are saved from this danger of repetition of birth and death.

Thank you very much.
