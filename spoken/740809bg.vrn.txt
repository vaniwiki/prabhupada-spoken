====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.3 ======

**Pradyumna:**
[leads chanting of verse, etc.] [devotees repeat]

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

[break] [01:38]

Translation: "Out of many thousands among men, one may endeavor for perfection, and of those who have achieved perfection, hardly one knows Me in truth."

**Prabhupāda:**

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

To understand Kṛṣṇa in truth, not superficially, but in fact, that we can understand, as Kṛṣṇa says in the beginning of this chapter,

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

How Kṛṣṇa is truth, the Absolute Truth, although the Absolute Truth is described in three phases in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...// Just like //vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. This //tattva.// Here it is said, //tattvataḥ.// The truth, Absolute Truth, is called //tattva.// So //vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ. Tattva-vid. Vid// means knowledge. //Vetti veda vido jñāne.// One who has got complete knowledge, he is called //vid, tattva-vid.// So //tattva-vid,// they ascertain the //tattva,// the truth, in three ways. //Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam.// So knowledge of the truth is nondual. Absolute means nondual---no relative---absolute, //advaya-jñāna.// So what is that //advaya-jñāna? Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.// So to approach Kṛṣṇa, to understand, one has to go through the //brahma-jñāna, brahmeti;// then Paramātmā, //paramātma-jñāna;// then //kṛṣṇa-jñāna. Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.//

So generally, those who are inquiring about the Absolute Truth, they come to the point of //brahma-jñāna. Brahma-jñāna.// Then, if one makes further advance, then he can understand //paramātma-jñāna. Paramātma-jñāna// means the all-pervasive Personality of Godhead, localized aspect. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. That is //paramātma-jñāna.// First of all, //brahma-jñāna,// then //paramātma-jñāna,// then //bhagavad-jñāna. Bhagavān iti śabdyate.// That //bhagavān// is Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. //Bhagavān// means opulent.

> aiśvaryasya samagrasya
> vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ
> jñāna-vairāgyayoś caiva
> bhaga itī ṣaṇṇāṁ ganā 
> [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]

One who has complete, in possession, all wealth, //aiśvarya; samagrasya,// all, //samagrasya...// So that is the one of the items of becoming Bhagavān. Nowadays there are so many Bhagavāns, so-called Bhagavān, but this is the first step: //aiśvaryasya samagrasya,// whether you possess all the wealth. Who can say so? There are... A person, he is living by begging, and he's claiming to become Bhagavān. So that is not the definition of Bhagavān. Bhagavān must possess all the wealth. As it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]: "I am the proprietor of the all the planetary system, all the //lokas,// all the universes." Actually that is the fact. So one who is begging for his livelihood, he is claiming, "I am Bhagavān." Just see.

They do not know what is Bhagavān. These rascals who unnecessarily, unceremoniously claiming to become Bhagavān, they do not know what is Bhagavān. Bhagavān is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā://

> yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya
> jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ
> viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣo
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.48]

This is one of the description of Bhagavān, Govinda. Kṛṣṇa is Govinda. So //govindam ādi-puruṣam.// He's the original, primeval Lord.

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

So these Bhagavān... There are expansion of Bhagavān. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. Bhagavān has got unlimited number of expansions. It is stated, "Just like you cannot count in the river how many waves are flowing, similarly, you cannot count even how many expansions are there of Bhagavān."

So one of the expansion of Bhagavān is Mahā-Viṣṇu. //Yasya hi kalā-viśeṣo, viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣaḥ. Kalā-viśeṣaḥ// means... //Kalā// means part of the expansion---not direct expansion, but part of the expansion. That is called //kalā. Aṁśa-kalā. Aṁśa// means direct expansion, and //kalā// means expansion of the //aṁśa.// So the Mahā-Viṣṇu is described as //kalā-viśeṣaḥ,// an expansion of the //aṁśa,// secondary. And what is that Mahā-Viṣṇu? Now, //yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// [Bs. 5.48]. //Jagad-aṇḍa// means this universe. There are millions and millions of universes. This is only one universe. This universe what you are seeing, this is only one. There are millions. [aside:] What is that? This is... This information we get also from the Vedic literature,

> yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-
> koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam
> tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.40]

So //yasyaika, yasya prabhā.// This //brahma-jyotir, brahma-jñāna,// is just like the rays. As the sunshine is the rays of the sun globe, similarly, the rays of the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is //brahma-jyotir.// And within that //brahma-jyotir,// there are innumerable universes. So in each universe... We have given the picture in our title cover of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So in each universe there are innumerable planets. In this way, this is a partial expansion, partial exhibition of Kṛṣṇa. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> athavā bahunaitena
> kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna
> viṣṭabhyāham...
> ekāṁśena sthito jagat
> [[books:bg:10:42|[Bg. 10.42]]]

//Ekāṁśena.// This whole, all the universes, they are simply partial exhibition of the partial expansion of Kṛṣṇa. //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalam...// [Bs. 5.48].

In this way you have to study Kṛṣṇa. Not that "Kṛṣṇa was born in His maternal uncle's house at Mathurā, and He played with the //gopīs// or the cowherd boys." That is actual fact, but one should understand Kṛṣṇa how great He is. That is called //tattvataḥ.//

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

They simply superficially study Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they cannot understand how great is Kṛṣṇa. In the Western world they say, "God is great." But one should understand how great He is. That is //tattvataḥ.// Otherwise, we shall be misled. We cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. The rascals, fools, asses---//mūḍhāḥ// means asses---they deride Kṛṣṇa, "Oh, Kṛṣṇa I understand. What is that Kṛṣṇa?" Not like that. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu:// "Out of many, many millions of persons..." First of all let him become //siddha. Siddha// means perfect. Everyone is imperfect. Everyone commits mistake. This is imperfection. Everyone commits mistake, everyone becomes illusioned, everyone's sense perception are all imperfect, and everyone is a cheater. These are the deficiency of the conditioned soul. One does not know what is Kṛṣṇa, and he wants to become Kṛṣṇa: "I am God. I am Kṛṣṇa."

So this is cheating. //Bhrama, pramāda, vipralipsa, karaṇa-pāṭava.// One should understand Kṛṣṇa, what is Kṛṣṇa. There are so many Vedic literatures to understand... //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. If you are studying //Vedas,// if you are Vedāntist, then ultimate knowledge will depend how you have understood Kṛṣṇa. //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. If you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, what is the use of your studying //Vedānta// and //Vedas?// It is useless. //Śrama eva hi kevalam// [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]. So don't try to understand Kṛṣṇa in that way. Generally, they understand Kṛṣṇa very easily---they are called //sahajiyās//---that "Kṛṣṇa was a young boy, and He was joking with the //gopīs// and dancing with the //gopīs,// and that is Kṛṣṇa. We can imitate also. We can do also." This kind of understanding means he's a rascal; he's a fool. That is, of course, Kṛṣṇa's one of the pastimes. But that is not this ordinary young boy and young girl's pastime. No. That is //cinmaya. Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.// That is //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.//

We have no understanding what is //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.// We are accustomed to taste this material //ānanda,// sense gratification. There are... //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Here, in this material world, the //ānanda// is sex gratification, sex intercourse. //Maithuna. Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham.// This is the most abominable //ānanda.// This is not //ānanda.// Although the whole world is //mohita... Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvair mohitam.// This is the //ānanda.// In the Western world we have seen even old men, seventy-five years old, eighty years old, they are going to the naked dance club, the sex //ānanda.// Because in the material world there is no //ānanda// except this. But in the //Bhagavad-gītā// you'll find, //sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriya-grāhyam// [[books:bg:6:20-23|[Bg. 6.21]]]. What is real //ānanda,// that you have to taste by your transcendental senses, not these senses, blunt senses. This is blunt senses, covered senses. There is no question of tasting //ānanda// with these senses. There is no possibility. //Ānanda// is described. Just like it is said, //ramante yoginaḥ anante// [[books:cc:madhya:9:29|[Cc. Madhya 9.29]]]. //Yoginaḥ,// those who are transcendentalists, above this material world, they also seeking after //ānanda// or tasting //ānanda. Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.// That is //satyānanda.// That is real //ānanda. Ramante yoginaḥ anante.// And there is no end of that //ānanda. Nityaṁ-navāyamānam.//

Caitanya Mahāprabhu has described,

> ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ
> śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam
> ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam... 
> [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]

//Ānandāmbudhi...// We have no experience that //ambudhi... Ambudhi// means the ocean; and //ānandāmbudhi,// the ocean of //ānanda, vardhanam,// it is increasing. It is increasing. We have no experience that the sea or the ocean is increasing. It is decreasing. So this is //ānanda. Ramante yoginaḥ anante.// That is //ananta ānanda. Ramante yoginaḥ anante satyānande cid-ātmani// [[books:cc:madhya:9:29|[Cc. Madhya 9.29]]]. That is not //jaḍātmā.// Here this //ānanda// is //jaḍa,// dull. It is not //ānanda,// material, but //cid-ātmani. Iti rāma-padenāsau paraṁ brahmābhidhīyate// [[books:cc:madhya:9:29|[Cc. Madhya 9.29]]]. These are the description. //Rāma// means one who takes //ānanda// in the reality, not in the false. So this is the way of understanding Kṛṣṇa. In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// it is said,

> siddhānta baliyā citte nā kara alasa
> ihā haite kṛṣṇe lāge sudṛḍha mānasa
> [[books:cc:adi:2:117|[Cc. Ādi 2.117]]]

"To understand Kṛṣṇa in truth, do not be lazy." "Oh, now I have understood Kṛṣṇa." What you have understood? Therefore we fall down. One should understand... Therefore, to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth, one has to devote, studying //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// nine cantos. In the Tenth Canto Kṛṣṇa is described because... Try. First of all become fit to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is called //tattvataḥ.//

So //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is there. //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya, janmādy asya yataḥ anvayāt itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ svarāṭ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Try to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth, not superficially. Of course, the ultimate goal is to understand Kṛṣṇa's pastimes in Vṛndāvana. //Gopī-bhāva-rasāmṛtābdhi...// But that... First of all, you become //siddha.// Without becoming //siddha,// you cannot understand. So long you are //asiddha,// imperfect, you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. But if you try, if you associate with the //siddhas... Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]]. You have to associate... Just like in the morning: //munibhir mahātmabhiḥ.// You have to understand Kṛṣṇa in the association of //mahātmās.// And who is //mahātmā? Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. //Mahātmā// is not in this material world. He is in the spiritual world. //Daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ. Bhajanti.// And the result is, always engaged in devotional service of Kṛṣṇa. That is //mahātmā.//

So Kṛṣṇa says that it is not very easy to understand Kṛṣṇa. People understand Kṛṣṇa very easily; therefore they are called //sahajiyās.// Everything takes very easily. So //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. //Manuṣyāṇām.// There are 400,000 species of //manuṣya//---400,000. //Catur-lakṣāṇi mānuṣāḥ. Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati, kṛmayo rudra-saṅkhyakāḥ// [Padma Purāṇa]. There are statements in the //Padma Purāṇa// how many living entities, forms, are there. So out of 8,400,000 different forms and species, there are 400,000 species of //manuṣya.// So out of them, one who is born in India, he is first-class //manuṣya.// That is a fact. Unfortunately, we are missing the chance. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]].

So those who are Indians present here should know that after many pious activities, one gets birth in India, //bhārata-bhūmite.// They should try to understand Kṛṣṇa. There is facility. There are //śāstras.// Kṛṣṇa personally speaks //Bhagavad-gītā.// Vyāsadeva speaks about Kṛṣṇa in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// We are neglecting, we have become so rascal and fools. This is not India's business, to imitate how economic development: "Money, money, money, money, money." This is not India's... India's business is to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// That is India's business. These Americans and Europeans have come here not to see how much you are economically developed, industrially developed. They have got enough of this, enough, more than enough. They don't care for it. The modern young men, they do not like. They are fed up. They have come here to understand Kṛṣṇa. They come here to understand Kṛṣṇa. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]].

Therefore we have... We are trying to construct this center. Let everyone come, all over the world. And it is the India's business to understand what is Kṛṣṇa and help them. That is India's business. It is very serious movement, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. On this platform, the whole world can be united. It is not ordinary movement---only on the basis of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Try to understand Kṛṣṇa.

Thank you very much.
