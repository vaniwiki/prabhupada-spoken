====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.5.31, partially recorded ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...affair of this Vṛndāvana-dhāma. They simply, they're searching after. They never said. //He rādhe vraja-devike ca lalite he nanda-sūno kutaḥ// [//Ṣaḍ-gosvāmy-aṣṭaka// 8]: "Oh, where is Rādhārāṇī? Where You are? Where are Your friends, Lalitā and Viśākhā? Where is Nanda, son of Mahārāja Nanda, Kṛṣṇa?" //Śrī-govardhana-kalpa-pādapa-tale kālindī-vane kutaḥ:// "Where are You? Are You near the Govardhana Hill or in the forest on the bank of the Yamunā?" //Ghoṣantāv iti khedair mahā-vihvalau.// They are crying, "Where is Kṛṣṇa? Where is Kṛṣṇa? Where is Rādhārāṇī? Where is...?" They're crying: //ghoṣantāv iti sarvato vraja-pure khedair mahā-vihvalau.// Mad. Mad after. //Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.// This is the process of //kṛṣṇa-bhajana.// Not that "I've seen just last night Kṛṣṇa dancing with the //gopīs.//" It is not so easy.

//Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved...// [Brs. 1.2.234]. So long we are materialistic, it is impossible to see what is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we have to follow the path chalked out by Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His immediate disciples, the six Gosvāmīs. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was mad. In Jagannātha Purī at night He became mad, "Where is Kṛṣṇa? Where is Kṛṣṇa?" He'd go on the seaside and drown Himself in the sea. And Svarūpa Dāmodara Gosvāmī could not see where is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Sometimes He was caught by the fisherman, and He became exhaus..., all night chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, simply by touching Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is very scientific, based on the philosophy given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and expanded by the Sanātana Gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī and other assistants.

> kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī
> dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau pūjitau
> śrī-caitanya-kṛpā-bharau...
> [Śrīnivāsa Ācārya]

These six Gosvāmīs directly got the mercy of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Therefore we have to understand this Vṛndāvana-dhāma through the Gosvāmīs. It is not that... Sometimes they say that we do not accept the Gosvām... No. We... We accept actually the Gosvāmīs. But following the footprints of Śrī Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, what kind of... //Ei chay gosāi jāṅr mui tāṅr dās.// One who is accepting the path of the six Gosvāmīs, we are servant of the servant of such persons. //Ei chay gosāi jāṅr mui tāṅr dās. Rūpa-raghunātha-pade hoibe ākuti kabe hāma bujhabo se jugala-pīriti. Jugala-pirīti.// These love affairs of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, this is not ordinary thing. It is completely spiritual.

> rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī śaktir asmād
> ekātmānāv api bhuvi purā deha-bhedaṁ gatau tau
> śrī caitanyākhyaṁ prakaṭam adhunā tad-dvayaṁ caikyam āptam...
> [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]

//Vande...// That verse I am forgetting. This is the process. //Rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtiḥ,// it is not the affair of one young boy or young man. It is not that. It is the exhibition of the pleasure potency of Kṛṣṇa, //hlādinī śaktir asmāt.// So it is completely spiritual. Do not try to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa //prema// immediately: "Oh, because I have come to Vṛndāvana, let me understand immediately Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa-līlā.//" It is not so easy. You have to undergo severe penances. Not severe; it is very easy. But we do not like to take.

But the best thing is, as Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, that

> viṣaya chāṛiyā kabe śuddha ha'be mana
> kabe hāma herabo śrī-bṛndābana

//Viṣaya chāṛiyā.// "So long I have got the propensity for sense gratification, there is no possibility for understanding what is Vṛndāvana. There is no possibility." It is the statement of Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. He says, //viṣaya chāṛiyā kabe śuddha. Viṣaya// means this //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. If you are still inclined for eating, sleeping and sex life, there is no possibility of understanding what is Vṛndāvana.

So these are the instruction. These are the confidential message given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and His followers. That is //yena.// If you follow this //yena gacchanti tat-padam// [[books:sb:1:5:31|[SB 1.5.31]]], then you are sure going back to home, back to Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. And that is the highest perfection of life.

Thank you very much.
