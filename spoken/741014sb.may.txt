====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.8.34 ======

**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> bhārāvatāraṇāyānye

[break] [01:18]

"Others say that the world, being overburdened like a boat at sea, is much aggrieved, and that Brahmā, who is Your son, prayed for You, and so You have appeared to diminish the trouble."

**Prabhupāda:**

> bhārāvatāraṇāyānye
> bhuvo nāva ivodadhau
> sīdantyā bhūri-bhāreṇa
> jāto hy ātma-bhuvārthitaḥ

So Brahmā's another name is Ātma-bhū. He is born from Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu without the help of Lakṣmī. Lakṣmī was there; she was massaging on the lotus feet of the Lord. But the Lord did not take help of Lakṣmī, and He gave birth to Brahmā. Therefore Brahmā's another name is Ātma-bhū, "born from the father directly, without taking the help of the mother." So another name is Svayambhū. Brahmā's another name is Svayambhū.

> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kapila kumāraḥ manuḥ
> prahlādo bhīṣma janaka 
> balir vaiyāsakir vayam
> [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]

Out of the twelve authorities of //śāstra,// Brahmā is the origin, and he has been explained as Svayambhū, Ātma-bhū, like that.

So this is the Supreme Personality's omnipotency. He does not require the help of another woman to beget child. Even Brahmā, he has given birth to so many children, not through woman but from his different parts of the body. So this we cannot conceive, because we are materially impeded. We cannot understand this is possible. So possibility and impossibility does not depend on our understanding. We have to take knowledge from the authority. Here, in the Vedic literature, we understand that Brahmā was born directly from the father. So we have to accept it. That is called Vedic knowledge. You cannot argue. That is possible. That is omnipotency. All potencies are there.

So Brahmā was approached by the earth, mother earth. She felt overburdened by the sinful activities of the demons. So Brahmā approaches Nārāyaṇa, er, Viṣṇu. Not directly he can see, but he can stand on the bank of the ocean of milk, and from there he can submit his petition. And Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu gives His order. So once upon a time, when the whole world was overburdened---this is the history of Kṛṣṇa's birth---so the earthly planet approached Brahmā to appeal to Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu to have His incarnation to diminish the burden of the world. The world is, of course, it is very heavy. We can understand there are so many oceans and so many big, big hills, besides your skyscraper building, and certainly the whole lump of matter is very heavy. But not only this planet, but many other planets, even the sun planet. It is heavier by fourteen hundred thousand times. Still, they are floating in the air by... Why? Because Kṛṣṇa enters in each of them.

In each of them... //Gām āviśya..., dhārayāmy aham ojasā// [[books:bg:15:13|[Bg. 15.13]]], Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that "I enter into each planetary system, each universe, and by My power I hold it. It is floating." Why it is floating? Because Kṛṣṇa is there. The atheist may not believe it, but it is a fact. It is a fact. How? Just like an animal or a man, while he is living, he can float in the air or in the water. That everyone has seen. But if the man is dead, it will not float; it will fall down. Is it not a fact? So why it is floating? Because a very small particle of Kṛṣṇa's spiritual potency is there. That is living entity. Big, big... An elephant, he can also float in the water, and the horses, elephant, and what to speak of man? This is practical. Because a small particle of the Supreme is there within this body... //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. Very small particle. How much small? One ten-thousandth part of the top of the hair. So small. It has got so power that it can hold the whole body floating in the air. Air... There are very, very big, big birds, they are floating in the air; very, very big eagle. They fly from one planet to another. Their resting place is... They start from one planet, and they go and rest in other planet. And they lay their eggs while flying. That eggs also become a bird simply by air cohesion. That's all.

**Devotee:**
Friction.

**Prabhupāda:**
Friction, yes. So there are so, so big, big arrangement in the kingdom of God. So it is not very difficult for Him to give birth to Brahmā or to float this whole universe or the planets in the air. We shall have to apply our intelligence by comparative study. So if it is possible to float a big body... There are many big bodies. The whale fish, it is as big as a ship; still, it is floating. Why? That small particle of spiritual entity is there, therefore it is floating. Then, if the Supreme Person enters into a big lump of matter, why it will not float? What is the reason? At least I try to understand in this way. Am I wrong or right? What is your opinion? Eh? [chuckles] No, it is...

So this is called faith. This is called faith. Unless you have got faith, you cannot understand what is Kṛṣṇa. //Ādau śraddhā. Śraddhā:// "Yes, Kṛṣṇa can make anything possible." That faith we must maintain. That is the basic. That has been explained by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, what is faith. Faith means complete conviction. //Śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya// [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]]. That is faith. //Viśvāsa.// If I say something, and if you believe cent percent, that is called faith. That is called faith. Not that "It may be," or not. No. So //śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa. Viśvāsa// means faith. How? What kind of faith? //Sudṛḍha niścaya:// firm faith, without any doubt. //Niścaya.// And what is that faith? //Kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya.// If one is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, then his all duty is done, finished. He has nothing to do. //Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]. As Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do---He has got so much potency that things are done very automatically---similarly, if you faith, have faith in Kṛṣṇa, //kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma,// then everything will be done automatically. Kṛṣṇa will do for him. So what is the difficulty there?

So this big, big lump of matter, earthly planet, they are actually not heavy, but it becomes heavier when there are demons. Demons means material activities. If there is spiritual activity, it remains very light. And if there is too much material activity and materialistic person, it become heavier and troublesome. So such time became possible, and therefore the earthly planet went to Brahmā to appeal to Viṣṇu to take His incarnation. So somebody said that //bhārāvatāra..., tāraṇāya, avatāraṇāya,// to diminish the burden. Burden. Just like a bad son is a burden of the father. This has been explained by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, that a stupid son... //Ko 'rthaḥ putreṇa jātena yo na vidvān na bhaktimān:// "What is the use of getting a son who is neither learned nor a devotee? Useless." //Ko 'rthaḥ putreṇa jātena:// "Such kind of son, what is the use?" The son who is not a devotee... Two things are required: the son should be a devotee or a learned. Without being learned, nobody can become devotee. If one becomes devotee, he's learned also. But sometimes materially learned, not devotee, it happens. So if one is neither learned nor devotee, what is the use of such son? The example is given, //kāṇena cakṣuṣā kiṁ cakṣuḥ pīḍaiva kevalam:// "If you have got one eye, cataract, you cannot see, but it is always troublesome." Unless you get it operated, it is simply troublesome. In many places it is said, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, //ko 'rthaḥ putreṇa jātena. Varam eko guṇī putro na ca mūrkha-śatair api:// "If you get one son very qualified, that is preferred. What is the use of having many sons and all of them are rascals and fools?" //Na ca mūrkha-śatair api.//

So as a father becomes perplexed when there are rascal sons, similarly, when there are increase of rascal population the world becomes overburdened. Therefore it is called... It is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā, varṇa-saṅkara. Varṇa-saṅkara.// Now the whole world is practically full of //varṇa-saṅkara.// First of all, there is no division of //varṇas. Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. According to quality, it can be done. But people are not interested. They want hodge-podge. Therefore they are suffering. They cannot systematically do anything. So when the system of //varṇa// and //āśrama// is destroyed... Just like in Western countries there is no such thing as //varṇa// and //āśrama.// Therefore the //varṇa-saṅkara,// the hippies... That is //varṇa-saṅkara.// The //varṇa-saṅkara...// In the //Bhagavad-gītā...// If the //varṇa-saṅkara// increases, //strīṣu duṣṭāsu varṇa-saṅkaro vibhavate.// When women become polluted, no fixed-up husband---that is pollution for a woman; no chaste, no chastity---then this //varṇa-saṅkara// will come out. And when the world is overpopulated by //varṇa-saṅkara,// it will become a burden. Therefore it so became, atheist, //varṇa-saṅkara,// demons. So it was unbearable by the earthly planet. And it is said, //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. Therefore mother earth went to appeal, "Please come and save me. I am very much overburdened." Therefore it is said, //bhārāvatāraṇāya:// "diminish."

So five thousand years ago Kṛṣṇa came to kill some of the demons. Not all of them were demons. But next time when Kṛṣṇa will come, it will be only demons. Only demons. Kalki //avatāra.// What is that //stotra? Keśava dhṛta-kalki-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare.// So at that time Kṛṣṇa will not preach //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kalki //avatāra// will simply come to cut the throat only. That will be the preaching. That will be preaching. //Mleccha-nivaha-nidhane kalayasi karavālam// [Daśāvatāra Stotra 10], //karālam. Karālam// means death personified. //Mleccha-nidhane. Mleccha// means meat-eaters. Those who are meat-eaters, fish-eaters, they are //mlecchas. Mleccha-yavana,// they are called, according to Vedic... So people are becoming meat-eaters nowadays. I have... There is no secrecy. Formerly, at least in India, the meat-eaters used to eat meat very secretly. We had seen in our childhood, if somebody will meat-eat, it was not allowed within the house. They, formerly, rich men, they used to keep Muslim servants as the caretaker of the horse or the carriage driver. So in the //astabal// [horse stable] they would secretly cook some meat, and the so-called Babu, //zamindar,// will eat. It was not allowed. And those who are not rich men---poor men, //śūdra// class---they would go to Kālī-ghāṭa and get one goat, sacrifice there, and cook there and eat, then come back. Meat-eating was not at all allowed. The higher caste, especially the //brāhmaṇas,// they would never touch. Still in some provinces, in Maharashtra provinces, in Madras... Of course, they are now taking.

So meat-eaters means //mleccha.// So now that is increasing, meat-eaters. So when wholesale population will be meat-eaters, //mleccha,// they'll not understand anything about spiritual matter---"Why it is forbidden?" Because the meat-eaters, they cannot understand anything about spiritual matter. It is very difficult. //Vinā paśughnāt.// Parīkṣit Mahārāja said,

> nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād
> bhavauṣadhi chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt
> ka uttamaśloka-guṇānuvādāt
> virajyeta pumān vinā paśughnāt
> [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]

This chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// is possible by a person who is //nivṛtta-tarṣa. Nivṛtta-tarṣa. Nivṛtta// means finished. //Brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam.// We have to finish this material business before we can understand spiritual thing. If one has got still inclination for material things, it is useless waste of time for him to understand, try to understand what is spiritual thing. So //nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānāt.// Actually the holy name of Lord can be chanted by a person like Haridāsa Ṭhākura, who has no other desire, material desire. But those are not like Haridāsa Ṭhākura, they may take it. //Bhavauṣadhi.// If he chants, then gradually he'll be released from this material disease. For them, this is the chance. Actually it is meant for liberated person like Haridāsa Ṭhākura. Then why we are chanting? We are chanting---//ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]---to cleanse our heart, to cure the material disease.

So it is actually relished by the liberated person, but those who are diseased like us, they can chant and gradually cure the material disease. This is the basic principle of chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa. //Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānāt. Upagīyamāna,// it is chanting. Why? //Bhavauṣadhi.// It is the medicine of this //bhava-roga.// What is that //bhava-roga? Bhava-roga... Bhava// means you pick up, means take your birth and again die. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. This is our disease. This is called //saṁsāra.// All these rascals in the material world, they are simply getting one body and again... //Vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihā...// [[books:bg:2:22|[Bg. 2.22]]]. When it is useless, no more cannot be used, then you get another body according to the price you pay. Just like when your garment is old, you purchase another garment. So you can purchase very good garment or not very good garment, as you pay price. Similarly, to get a different type of garment or this body, you'll have to pay price. Price. If you are in higher status of consciousness, then //ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ// [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]: you get your body in the higher planetary system where the comforts are thousands and thousand times better than this.

We can understand that, that the material comforts in the Western country are better than in this country. Similarly, //ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ:// we can go to the higher planetary systems; we get more duration of life. Just like Brahmā has got very, very long, millions and millions of years to our calculation. Just like the insect who comes, attacks us at night. Their duration of life? That night only. Within the night they are born, they have sex life, and they beget children and increase the population, and as soon as the night finished, all finished. They have got also duration of life. And if you say to them that "There is another animal called man. This night is only twelve hours, and he has got day, another twelve hours. In this way, one month. In... Thirty days. And then..." He becomes surprised: "How it is possible?" Similarly, when we calculate the age of Brahmā, we become astonished: "How such millions and millions of years...?" Because we, in comparison to Brahmā, we are like insect.

So this is scientific. This world is relative. This is relative world. According to your position, you get. The time is also relative. What is present..., past, present, future for you, that is not past, present, future for others. So what is past, present for Brahmā, that is not past, present, future for us. Everything is relative. And in the creation of Kṛṣṇa there are so many relativities. Therefore it is called relative world. Time is eternal, but on account of our relative birth and death, we make our own past and present. Otherwise, time is eternal. Therefore, for Kṛṣṇa, there is no such thing as past, present and future. Because He is He, He's time eternal. Therefore He knows everything. //Vedāham.// Just like you know, present, everything---there is no past; there is no future---similarly, for Kṛṣṇa there is no such, past and future. Therefore He could say that "Formerly, millions and trillions of years ago," according to Arjuna's calculation, "I spoke this //Bhagavad-gītā// to sun-god." He did not believe it, because he is relatively calculating past and present. But Kṛṣṇa is not within that past and present. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said that "Both you, you and Me, we appear many times." //Bahūni me vyatītāni.// "And you were also. But you forget, because you have got past, present, future. I have no such thing. Therefore I remember."

So in this way, if people become irreligious or not spiritual, the burden of the world becomes heavier, unbearable. That you can understand. I have already explained. This body, this body, you weigh it. Say, it is one man, fifty //seers// or something like. But as soon as it will be dead, the burden will be..., the weight will increase. Is it not? What do you think? The weight will increase. Not the same weight. So, so long people are materialistic, the burden will increase. And so long people are spiritualistic, there will be no burden.

So //bhārāvatāraṇāya anye bhuvo nāva ivodadhau.// Just like if there is a boat, then you can cross over the sea or the river with the help, so when you are Kṛṣṇa conscious, then you can cross over the sea of nescience very easily. //Bhuvo nāva iva udadhau, sīdantyā bhūri-bhāreṇa. Bhūri-bhāreṇa,// very heavily burdened. So she was lamenting, "My Lord, save me." So the conclusion is that if people become simply atheistic or materialistic... Materialistic means atheistic. And then the weight of the earth, or any planet, will increase and the situation will degrade, and everyone will be unhappy and there will be restlessness. And at that time, Kṛṣṇa comes. He says, //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]].

So at the present moment, the actually it is overburdened by the material activities. So Kṛṣṇa has descended already. Kṛṣṇa has descended already. //Nāma-rūpe kali-kāle kṛṣṇa avatāra.// Kṛṣṇa has taken His incarnation in the form of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// So if people take to it, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// the present situation of the world can be favorable for our living, and atmosphere will change. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for this purpose, to give people relief from all these burdens so that they can peacefully live, understand the value of life and become spiritualized, so they live peacefully in this life and go back to home, back to Godhead. That is the mission of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
