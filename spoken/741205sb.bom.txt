**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

[break] [01:38]

"Upon seeing the charming forms of the Lord, smiling and attractive, and hearing His very pleasing words, the pure devotee almost loses all other consciousness. His senses are freed from all other engagements, and he becomes absorbed in devotional service. Thus in spite of his unwillingness, he gets liberation without separate endeavor."

**Prabhupāda:**

So, //śrī-vigraha-darśanam.// This temple is situated to give people the facility as it is described here. //Tair darśanīya avayavaiḥ udāra.// We have to see the Deity beginning from the lotus feet, not jumping over the smiling face. That is the way. First of all you try to see. And when you are practiced... Try to see the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and when you are practiced to this habit, even after visiting the temple if you go home, if you are practice to see the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, that is meditation. So //darśanīya avayavaiḥ:// "Different limbs." First of all feet, then the thighs, then the belt, then the chest, then you reach the smiling face. Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's form... If you meditate on Kṛṣṇa's form, that is Kṛṣṇa. So we associate with Kṛṣṇa, His smiling face, His flute, His hand, His dress, His consort, Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī or any other, //gopīs,// surrounded by. In this way, practice this habit of observing the Supreme Lord. Therefore He has appeared //arcā-vigraha,// so that we can see Him.

In our present eyes even Kṛṣṇa comes, but we have no eyes to see. Therefore for the //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī...// There are three kinds of devotees: //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī, madhyama-adhikārī// and //uttama-adhikārī. Uttama-adhikārī// means first class, most advanced; and //madhyama-adhikārī// means in the middle stage, not very advanced, not very lower; and //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,// just the neophyte, beginning. So for the beginners it is recommended that you see the Deity daily or always. Beginning from the lotus feet, as you are practiced, then go up to the smiling face. And hear also //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// Simply if you try to see and if you don't hear, then it will not stay very much. Therefore we see practically in many temples, because there is no discussion about Kṛṣṇa, simply a Deity is there, people go for some time, then gradually, especially those who are educated, so-called educated, they do not feel very much interested. And it has actually happened so. Many temples, they are not visited even by the devotees, because there must be also hearing about. Two things must go on: the Deity must be worshiped---this is called //pāñcarātriki-vidhi//---and to hear about the Supreme from //Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Vedic literature---that is called //bhāgavata-vidhi.//

So the //pāñcarātriki-vidhi// and //bhāgavata-vidhi// must go parallel. Then one, even one is a neophyte, gradually he will come to the intermediate stage between the neophyte stage and to the advanced stage. And of course, it is very difficult to find out one in very advanced stage. But there are. There are many advanced stage. At least, the spiritual master is supposed to be in the advanced stage, but for preaching purpose he come down in that intermediate stage, for preaching work. Because the advanced stage, there is no discrimination that "Here is a devotee, and here is a nondevotee." Because advanced devotee sees that everyone is devotee except himself. The advanced devotee sees that he is not a devotee, but all others are devotees. This is advancement. But in the //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,// in the neophyte stage, they simply concentrate on the Deity. //Arcāyām eva haraye yaḥ pūjāṁ śraddhayā īhate.// That is required in the beginning. According to the prescribed duties as they are mentioned in the scriptures, one must take care of the Deity. But that, unless a little farther advanced, he does not know who is a devotee and what is his function with others.

In the //madhyama-adhikāra,// when one still farther advances, he has got four kind of visions:

> īśvare tad-adhīneṣu
> bāliśeṣu dviṣatsu ca
> prema-maitrī-kṛpopekṣā
> yaḥ karoti sa madhyamaḥ
> [SB 11.2.46]

//Madhyama-adhikārī// is not only interested in Deity worship, but he knows who is a devotee and who is innocent and who is Bhagavān. //Īśvara tad-adhīneṣu bāliśeṣu. Bāliśa// means innocent. There are many innocent men, they... Actually, they do not know what is to be done, who is God. They are innocent. They are not offender. But there are other others who are offenders, //dviṣat. Dviṣat// means envious. They are immediately envious as soon as they hear of a devotee of God. They are called envious, //dviṣat.// So //madhyama-adhikārī,// he knows God, Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. So he wants to develop his love for Kṛṣṇa. //Avyartha-kālaṁ vasati, nāma-gāne sadā ruciḥ.// The //madhyama-adhikārī,// he wants to see that not a moment is wasted without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is //madhyama-adhikārī. Avyartha-kālatvam// [[books:cc:madhya:23:18-19|[Cc. Madhya 23.18-19]]]. He's always careful that "Whether I am spoiling the valuable time of my life." That is the first qualification of //madhyama-adhikārī. Avyartha-kālatvam.// Because we have got very short period, living period. We do not know when we shall die. There is no certainty. Foolish people may think that "I shall live forever," but that is foolishness. Life is very transient. At any moment we can die. Therefore those who are advanced devotee, they want to see that "I have got very short period of life at my disposal..." Therefore, he is very anxious to utilize every moment for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is //madhyama-adhikārī. Avyartha-kālatvam.//

And //nāma-gāne sadā ruciḥ:// "And he has got special taste for chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//" //Nāma-gāne sadā ruciḥ. Vasati tad..., prītis tad-vasati sthale// [[books:cc:madhya:23:18-19|[Cc. Madhya 23.18-19]]]: "And he is very much anxious to live in such places like Vṛndāvana, Dvārakā, Mathurā, where Kṛṣṇa lived." //Tad-vasati sthale. Vasati// means residential. When Kṛṣṇa appears on this planet, He lives in Mathurā, Vṛndāvana, Dvārakā //dhāma.// So a devotee also, advanced devotee, they want to live in the residential places of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, God, has got His residential places everywhere. That's a fact. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. He is residing even within the atom. But still, He has got special residential places like Vṛndāvana, Dvārakā, Mathurā. So a devotee is anxious to live in those places.

//Prītis tad-vasati sthale, nāma-gāne sadā ruciḥ, avyartha-kālatvam.// Their business is to increase love of God. To increase love of God means there is also process, how to increase. The process is given by Rūpa Gosvāmī:

> ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā
> tato 'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt tato niṣṭhā tataḥ rucis
> athāsaktis tato bhāvas...
> sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]

These are the gradual steps. //Śraddhā. Śraddhā// means faith. Faith is the beginning. Without faith, you cannot make..., there is no question of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Faith means that faith is created after reading //Bhagavad-gītā.// If you read //Bhagavad-gītā// carefully and if you actually understand //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, then the faith will be created. Without reading //Bhagavad-gītā,// there is no question of faith in Kṛṣṇa. So what is that faith? That Kṛṣṇa says that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], so, "You give up all other engagements. You just surrender to Me, and I shall give you protection." So if we have got faith, if we believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa, that is called faith. If we don't believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa, if we study as a literary thesis and then throw it away, that is not faith.

The faith is explained by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī. He says, //'śraddhā'-śabde---viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya// [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]]. Faith means one who has got firm faith in the words of Kṛṣṇa. That is called faith. "I am reading //Bhagavad-gītā,// but I do not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead or He is a person, as He says in the //Bhagavad-gītā...//" He says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. //Mattaḥ,// when He says He's a person... So Kṛṣṇa says that "There is no more better personality or better superior existence than Myself." //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. He says "Me." //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. //Ahaṁ sarvasya... Aham,// "Me," "I." He says everywhere. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa is person. Kṛṣṇa is not imperson. //Kleśaḥ adhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām// [[books:bg:12:5|[Bg. 12.5]]]. It is said that "One who is impersonalist, he takes more trouble to come to Me. He will come later on, but it will take some time."

The impersonal feature of understanding of the Supreme Absolute Truth, it is partial understanding. Just like we have explained several times that we have got experience of the sunshine, because sunshine is very easily approached. But that understanding of the sunshine is not real understanding of the sun globe or sun planet or the sun-god. That is not perfect understanding. It is partial understanding that you can understand the sun globe is full of heat and light. That's all. But how much heat, what is the temperature of heat, how much light is there and where is the source of heat and light, that is not possible to understand. Everyone will admit this, that simply by seeing, because the sunshine is entering your room from the window, that does not mean you know everything of the sun. Similarly, this impersonal understanding of the Absolute Truth is like that. Just like sunshine is impersonal, but the sun-god is person. If sun-god is not person, how Kṛṣṇa says, //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]? "This //Bhagavad-gītā...//" He says to Arjuna that "This //Bhagavad-gītā,// science of //Bhagavad-gītā,// or this //yoga// system, //bhakti-yoga// system, I spoke to sun-god. Exactly like that, I am speaking to you." So Arjuna is person, and Kṛṣṇa is person. Therefore the..., in the sun planet the predominating deity is a person. He is not imperson.

So you cannot understand that person simply by seeing the sunshine. That requires better qualification, how to enter the sun planet, how to see the predominating deity. The impersonalists, they simply conclude that, the same way as we foolish persons conclude, that the sun planet is simply a fiery substance, and there is nothing, no... If there is nothing, if there is no sun-god, predominating deity or the president of the sun globe, then how Kṛṣṇa could speak with him? In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //ahaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān.// Just like we talk. We are talking with you. We are not talking in the sky, vacant. We are talking with persons. These are intelligent. These require intelligence. So now we can imagine that "How the sun-god can be person? It is a fiery, big fire substance, and how one can live?" This is also foolishness. "Because I cannot live in the fire, therefore nobody can live in the fire," that is my foolishness. My body is not so made. Just like you cannot live in the water. It does not mean that there is no living entity in the water. It requires intelligence. Similarly, if you cannot live in the fire, it does not mean that nobody lives there. Yes. There are living entities whose body is so made. Just like the fish and other aquatics, they live. Their body is so made. This is intelligent study. Otherwise, if you simply compare with my intelligence, my position, my circumstances, and we'll conclude all others like that, that is blindness. That is not... Blindness.

So similarly, impersonal realization of God, that is imperfect, exactly like the understanding of the sunshine is not understanding of the sun globe and the sun-god. Everyone can understand. It is not very difficult. If you think that "Because I have seen sunshine, then I have seen everything; I have known everything of the sun..." No. You do not know even how big the sun globe is. And when you read books, when you read scientific books, you can understand it is fourteen hundred times bigger than this planet. So ultimately God is person. He is not imperson. Impersonal understanding is imperfect, partial understanding, that if God, Kṛṣṇa, is //sac-cid-ānanda vigraha... Sat, cit, ānanda// [Bs. 5.1]. So impersonal understanding of Kṛṣṇa means you understand only the //sat// portion. The two other portion, //cit// and //ānanda,// you do not know. You do not know.

So if you understand Kṛṣṇa, then you understand the impersonal Brahman realization and localized Paramātmā realization. That is stated in the //Vedas. Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati// [Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.3]. If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa, then you understand the other two features, because Kṛṣṇa is //ānanda.// You see Kṛṣṇa's feature. He is not thinking, taxing His brain, "How to do this? How to do that?" No. He is //ānandamaya. Ānandamaya:// He's playing on His flute, and Rādhārāṇī is there. He is in ecstatic //ānanda, hlādinī-śakti. Rādhā kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktiḥ.// It is the transaction of bliss, transcendental bliss, //hlādinī-śakti.// Kṛṣṇa has got many potencies. Out of that, one potency is //hlādinī-śakti,// pleasure-giving. He is //ātmārāma.// He is full in Himself. When He wants to enjoy, He expands Himself, His pleasure potency. So Rādhārāṇī is His pleasure potency, and the //gopīs// are expansion of Rādhārāṇī. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ. Nija-rūpa.// The forms are Kṛṣṇa's, but //ānanda-cinmaya-rasa,// just to taste the mellow of transcendental bliss.

> ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis
> tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ
> goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.37]

This is a verse from the //Brahma-saṁhitā.//

So Kṛṣṇa is... We are seeing the form of Kṛṣṇa. That is the ultimate understanding of the Absolute Truth. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.//

> vadanti tat tattva-vidas
> tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam
> brahmeti paramātmeti
> bhagavān iti śabdyate
> [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]

So //sac-cid-ānanda.// The Brahman realization is //sat// realization, Paramātmā realization is //cit// realization and Bhagavān realization means //ānanda// realization. //Sat, cit, ānanda.// And in the //Vedānta-sūtra// it is said that the Absolute Truth is //ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. //Ānandamaya.// He's always //ānandamaya.// You read Kṛṣṇa's //līlā//---He's always full of transcendental bliss, especially in Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana, that is His original residence. There, simply //ānanda.// Kṛṣṇa is playing with His cowherds boys friends. Kṛṣṇa is dancing with the //gopīs.// Kṛṣṇa is stealing Mother Yaśodā's butter. Kṛṣṇa is doing... All //ānanda,// transcendental bliss.

So here it is stated that if you begin your devotional service as it is prescribed here, simply see the Deity, then gradually realize how Kṛṣṇa is smiling, how Kṛṣṇa is playing on His flute, how Kṛṣṇa is enjoying the company of Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī... We have to see simply. Simply by seeing. And if you hear about Kṛṣṇa, just you are hearing now, these two processes will increase in such a way that one time, //anicchato me gatim aṇvīṁ prayuṅkte:// you'll automatically become a great devotee, simply if you come to this temple, or any temple where Deity is very nicely worshiped. These are all scientific. It is not imagination. Just like people think that "They are worshiping idol and imagining something." No, they are stated in this all //śāstra.// It is the prescribed method for developing your God consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is a science, //vijñāna-samanvitam.//

> jñānaṁ parama-guhyaṁ me
> yad vijñāna-samanvitam
> sa-rahasyaṁ tad-aṅgaṁ ca
> gṛhāṇa gaditaṁ mayā
> [[books:sb:2:9:31|[SB 2.9.31]]]

When Kṛṣṇa advised Brahmā after creation, then He said, //jñānaṁ me...// This is called //catuḥ-śloki-bhāgavata// [[books:sb:2:9:33|[SB 2.9.33-36]]], the four //ślokas// which is the basic principle of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Jñānaṁ parama-guhyaṁ.// The knowledge of Kṛṣṇa is very confidential, //guhyam. Guhyād guhyatamam.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// is said, "My dear Arjuna, I have spoken to you so many things, but now, because you are My very dear friend and devotee, therefore I am disclosing the most confidential knowledge." What is that? //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "Just surrender to Me. That's all. This is the confidential knowledge. Don't try to understand many things, or if you have heard, if you could not understand Me here, then I tell you. This is the most confidential part of knowledge, that //sarva-dharmān parityajya.//" Before this verse, //guhyād guhyatamam. Guhyād guhyatamam. Guhya// means very confidential. So this //guhya,// this Brahman realization, is also very confidential. But Paramātmā realization is //guhyatara,// still more confidential. And to understand Kṛṣṇa is //guhyatama,// superlative degree. //Guhyād guhyatamam.//

So to understand Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa has explained in so many ways. Simply to understand Kṛṣṇa makes you liberated. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. So therefore this is the process of understanding Kṛṣṇa. These Kṛṣṇa consciousness centers are being opened all over the world just to give the people the chance how to become liberated simply by seeing the Deity and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// This is the opportunity. But fools and rascals, they think that "It is nuisance." But actually it's not. This is a science. So by following this process, then what will be the...? //Hṛtātmano hṛta-prāṇāṁś ca:// "Then gradually, your mind will be fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, mind and senses." //Hṛtātmanaḥ// and //hṛta-prāṇa. Prāṇa,// we..., our //prāṇa,// life, is at the senses. So if your mind and senses are fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is called //bhakti.// That is called //bhakti.// It is not sentiment; it is a practical science when your mind and senses are fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa. The senses are engaged in serving Kṛṣṇa and mind is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa.

//Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. Just like Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, he was a great devotee, and his business was, although he was a king, very responsible king and ruling over the world, but his mind was always absorbed in Kṛṣṇa. This is possible. This is possible. That example is given, that a woman or a lady is always busy in his [her] household affairs, but she also takes care of her bunch of hair, how to set it up and very nicely comb it. She does not forget. In spite of her being engaged in so many household affairs, she does not forget to take care of the bunch of hair. Similarly, one who is actually devotee, he may be engaged in so many things, but he does not forget Kṛṣṇa. That is the example, very good example.

So //hṛtātmano hṛta-prāṇāṁś ca bhaktiḥ.// This is the perfection. This means that the gross body and the subtle body becomes digested, no more existence of this gross body. Gross body means sense gratification, and subtle body means speculation: "God is like that, God is like that," speculation, subtle body. //Mana-buddhy-ahaṅkāra.// And gross body means the senses. So when the senses and the mind, everything, is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that means you are already liberated. Already liberated. Therefore it is said, //anicchato me gatim aṇvīṁ prayuṅkte.// The liberated means that you have no more the activities of gross body and subtle body, but there are activities of the soul. This is wanted. The //bhakti// means the activities of the soul, not of the body, not of the mind.

The Brahman realization means stopping the activities of the body. But the activities of the mind is going on, or they do not know; it is not perfect knowledge. Therefore I have said several times that the Brahman realization, those who are Brahman realized souls, they are not in perfect knowledge. //Aviśuddha-buddhi.// They have been described as //aviśuddha. Viśuddha// means very purified, and //a// means "not." //Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. Their intelligence is not yet perfectly purified. //Aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ. Ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa.// They are thinking that "Now we have become liberated." No. That is not liberation. Here is liberation. Why? //Hṛtātmano hṛta-prāṇāṁś ca bhaktiḥ.// When the mind and the senses are all absorbed in Kṛṣṇa, that is the //bhakti// state. //Mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. The people think that //bhakti// is a sentiment thing. No. It is above liberation. Above liberation. Unless one is not liberated, he cannot stand on the platform of //bhakti.// That is //bhakti.// That is called //parā-bhakti. Aparā-bhakti// and //parā-bhakti.//

So any devotee who is serious about this Deity worship, hearing about Kṛṣṇa, chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// following the Vedic principle, or rejecting the sinful activities of life... In this way we can come to the platform of spiritual life, and if we act accordingly, that is called //bhakti-yoga,// or the liberated stage.

Thank you very much.
