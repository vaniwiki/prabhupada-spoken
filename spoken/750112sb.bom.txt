====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 3.26.35–36 ======

**Nitāi:**
[leads chanting of verse, etc.] [devotees repeat]

> nabhasaḥ śabda-tanmātrāt
> kāla-gatyā vikurvataḥ
> sparśo 'bhavat tato vāyus
> tvak sparśasya ca saṅgrahaḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:35|[SB 3.26.35]]]

Sound. [break] [01:11]

"From ethereal existence, which evolves from sound, the next transformation takes place under the impulse of time, and thus the subtle element touch and thence air and sense of touch become prominent."

**Prabhupāda:**

> nabhasaḥ śabda-tanmātrāt
> kāla-gatyā vikurvataḥ
> sparśo 'bhavat tato vāyus
> tvak sparśasya ca saṅgrahaḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:35|[SB 3.26.35]]]

So everything is explained there one after another, subtle things, how changing from ether, this sound, sense perception. There is ether... In the space also, there is ether, and we can understand the presence of ether by sound. The sound is being produced on account of ether. And when it is further developed, it creates the sense perception of touch. //Śabda, sparśa,// then //rūpa, rūpa,// then //gandha.// In this way the material existence becoming tangible or visible. //Rūpa// is the last stage. //Gandha,// not //rūpa, gandha. Rūpa, rasa, rasa.// Then, when after //sparśa// there will be manifestation of //rūpa,// form, and after form there is taste, and after taste there is //gandha.// This will be explained one after another.

[aside:] You can read the purport also.

**Nitāi:**
"In the course of time, when the subtle forms are transformed into gross forms, they become the objects of touch. The objects of touch and the tactile sense also develop after this evolution in time. Sound is the first sense object to exhibit material existence, and from the perception of sound, touch perception evolves, and from touch perception the perception of sight. That is the way of the gradual evolution of our perceptive objects."

**Prabhupāda:**
You can read the next purport. //Mṛdutvaṁ kaṭhinatvaṁ ca.//

**Nitāi:**
[leads chanting of verse, synonyms, etc.]

> mṛdutvaṁ kaṭhinatvaṁ ca
> śaityam uṣṇatvam eva ca
> etat sparśasya sparśatvaṁ
> tan-mātratvaṁ nabhasvataḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:36|[SB 3.26.36]]]

"Softness and hardness and cold and heat are the distinguishing attributes of touch, which is characterized as the subtle form of air."

**Prabhupāda:**

> mṛdutvaṁ kaṭhinatvaṁ ca
> śaityam uṣṇatvam eva ca
> etat sparśasya sparśatvaṁ
> tan-mātratvaṁ nabhasvataḥ
> [[books:sb:3:26:36|[SB 3.26.36]]]

These are all different transformation of the ethereal existence. So in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]. So our these material pains and pleasure are felt on account of this //sparśa,// an arrangement of the ether and transformation of ethereal activities. Actually, it has nothing to do with the spirit soul. Spirit soul is untouched by all these thing. It requires simply realization. Great devotees like Bharata Mahārāja or Prahlāda Mahārāja, Haridāsa Ṭhākura, because they were very, very much advanced in spiritual consciousness, these ethereal activities on the external body did not touch them. Even in our Western world, Lord Jesus Christ, he was also crucified, but it did not touch him.

So this is to be practiced, that we should not be disturbed by the ethereal transformation in touch with the skin and be disturbed in our regular activities in devotional service. That is called //sthita-prajña.// In the... The word is used in the //Bhagavad-gītā, sthita-prajña.// So a devotee is //sthita-prajña.// He should not be disturbed by this material condition, or change of ethereal activities. We should be fixed up, //ātma-stha, ātma-stha.// And then our progress in spiritual life will be unhampered. Actually, as it is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, ahaituky apratihatā.//

> sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo
> yato bhaktir adhokṣaje
> ahaituky apratihatā
> yenātmā suprasīdati
> [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]

When we are firmly fixed up in devotional service, that is the highest transcendental form of religion.

There are so many religious system---Hindu religion, Muslim religion, Christian religion---but they are all material conception of religion. Material conception means that we are in this material world, and through a process or system we are trying to understand what is God. That is called religion. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. The attempt to understand God and His laws, that is religion. So it doesn't matter whether it is executed through a system called Hindu religion or a system called Muslim religion or a system called Christian religion. If the objective is the same, Adhokṣaja, then that process is first-class religion. If we simply stick to a system without making any progress towards the goal of understanding the Adhokṣaja, then it is //śrama eva hi kevalam.//

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed ratiṁ yadi 
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

Don't be stuck up in a system. The system is required, provided if you make progress towards the realization of the Supreme. But if you simply follow a system but do not make advance in the matter of realizing the Supreme, then, according to //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// or according to the Vedic version, it is simply labor of love. It has no value. Therefore //Bhāgavata// says, "That is first-class religion system." It doesn't matter you call it Hindu or Muslim or Christian or Buddha. "That is first-class religion which helps you progressing in realization of the Adhokṣaja." Adhokṣaja, another name of Kṛṣṇa. //Adhokṣaja// means the subject matter which you cannot understand simply by mental speculation or by empiric knowledge, by exercising an empiric knowledge. That is called //adhokṣaja. Adhah-kṛtaṁ akṣa-jaṁ yatra.//[?]

So //adhok...// We have to approach that Adhokṣaja. There are different stages of knowledge: //pratyakṣa, parokṣa, aparokṣa, adhokṣaja, aprākṛta.// So we have to approach the //aprākṛta,// transcendental, above the material nature. //Adhokṣaja// is almost nearer than the lower grade of knowledge, //pratyakṣa, parokṣāparokṣa.// They are in the //kaniṣṭha-adhikāra.//

> arcāyām eva haraye
> yaḥ pūjāṁ ahate
> na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu
> sa bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ
> [SB 11.2.47]

So //prākṛta// stage is //pratyakṣa// knowledge, direct perception; and knowledge received from //paramparā... Pratyakṣa, parokṣa,// then //aparokṣa,// self-realization, then //adhokṣaja, aprākṛta.// So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is //aprākṛta// knowledge. It is the topmost platform of knowing Kṛṣṇa, //aprākṛta// knowledge. So, so long we are up to the //adhokṣaja// knowledge, that is regulative principles. We have to follow the regulative principles strictly. And //aprākṛta// knowledge is for the //paramahaṁsa.// There is... That is called //rāga-bhakta.// In these stages, //pratyakṣa, parokṣa,// they are called //viddhi-bhakti.// But without //viddhi-bhakti// you cannot reach to the platform of //rāga-bhakti,// although that is our aim. //Rāgānugā, rāga-bhakti// is executed following the footprints of the devotees in Vṛndāvana. That is called //rāga-bhakti.// Kṛṣṇa's personal associates. Not to become directly Kṛṣṇa's personal associate, but following the footprints of Kṛṣṇa's eternal associates we can come to the stage of //rāga-bhakti.// That is called //parā-bhakti.// That //parā-bhakti// is required.

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is gradually developing up to the stage of //rāga-bhakti// or //parā-bhakti.// Then life is successful. In that way we should not be disturbed by these ethereal interactions. As it is stated here, //mṛdutvaṁ kaṭhinatvaṁ ca śaityam uṣṇatvam eva ca.// We are disturbed by these things. Suppose we are lying on the floor. It is //kaṭhinatvam:// it is very hard. But if we given a cushion or a nice mattress, that is //mṛdutvam.// Similarly, //śītoṣṇa.// Water, sometimes it is felt very chilly, cold, and sometimes it is very hot. The water is the same; according to the change of ethereal arrangement, it is becoming in different position, different condition. And it is the source of pains and pleasure on account of this touch, the skin. The skin is touch. So if we understand fully that "I am not this body," that requires realization, //ātmānubhūti.//

The more we become advanced in spiritual consciousness, the more we become situated in //ātma-stha.// That is called //sthita-prajña.// Then we shall not be disturbed. And we should practice not to be disturbed by these conditional or ethereal transformation. We should. Because we do not belong, as spirit soul, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi,// I do not belong to this material arrangement, but I have been accustomed to this. So by practice I have to come to the spiritual status. And during practice it requires tolerance. That is called //bhajana, sādhana// or //tapasya,// austerity, penance, tolerance. The things which are not, but somehow or other, we have identified with such material things, and to practice again, come to the spiritual platform, that tolerance is called //tapasya.// This is the meaning of //tapasya. Tapaḥ// means pain, to voluntarily accepting some pain. Just like //sannyāsa, kali-kāra//[?]. In this age it is very difficult. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave us the example that He was lying down on the floor. His devotee wanted to give Him a quilt, a soft bedding, but He refused. He did not take it. So He is teaching us. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the teacher. //Āpani ācari' prabhu jīvere śikhaila.// But still, it is very difficult to strictly follow. But we must try to follow as far as possible.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu has therefore taught us, //tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31, Śikṣāṣṭaka 3]]]. We must be tolerant like the tree, or more than the tree. The trees, they are standing in the open air, and there are so many disturbances---storms, scorching heat, and somebody is taking the leaf, somebody cutting. It doesn't protest. Tolerance. This is very good example of tolerance. So in order to execute our spiritual consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we shall learn tolerance. Tolerance, that is advised in //Bhagavad-gītā,// that //tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]: "Don't be disturbed." Just like a //brāhmaṇa// or a //sannyāsī// has to take three times bath. And if it is very chilly cold, it does not mean that he will give up that taking bath three times, early in the morning. He must take. That is called tolerance. This is one of the example of tolerance. There is severe cold, chilly cold, but my duty is to take bath in the morning. So we must tolerate. I must tolerate that chilly cold, and still, I take my bath. This is called //tapasya.// Not that "It is very chilly cold. I will not take my bath." No, that is not allowed. Then you are lagging behind. You must take. Of course, if it is very serious..., somebody seriously ill, that is different thing. Generally, Kṛṣṇa advises, //tāṁs titikṣa... Mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ, anityāḥ// [[books:bg:2:14|[Bg. 2.14]]]. //Anitya. Anitya// means they are not permanent. //Āgamāpāyino 'nityāḥ.// They are seasonal changes. They will come and they will go. Simply ethereal arrangement only, we must know, external arrangement. It is, rather, illusion.

External arrangement means illusion. We have nothing to do with it. But due to this Kali-yuga especially, we are very much affected by these external disturbances. And that disturbances sometimes make us forced to forget our relationship with the Supreme, and that is called illusion, that is called //māyā.// But if we become very strictly adherent to Kṛṣṇa consciousness... That is very easily done at the Kali-yuga. //Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet// [SB 12.3.51]. //Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya.// If you strictly chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma... That... It is especially prescribed for the men in this age. Then we become //mukta-saṅga. Mukta-saṅga// means although we are in this material world, we are not in touch with it. That is called //mukta-saṅga. Mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet.// We remain untouched by the material contamination and gradually becoming perfect. Then we can be transferred to the spiritual world.

Our this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is pursuing, following the footstep of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

These are all according to Vedic injunction. This Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is not a manufactured way. This is actually following the Vedic principle. This is //Agni-Purāṇa, Brahmāṇḍa-Purāṇa, Brahma-vaivarta-Purāṇa// and //Kali-santaraṇa-Upaniṣad.// There are many Vedic literatures, they are recommended this Hare Kṛṣṇa. Sometime it is said, "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare"; sometime it is "Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare." So people become puzzled which one should be first vibrated. So any one you can vibrate. Either you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa or Hare Rāma in the beginning, it doesn't matter. There is no difference between the holy name of Kṛṣṇa and Rāma. But still, there is some distinction. In the //śāstra// it is said that "If you chant one thousand times Lord Viṣṇu's name, that is equal to chanting one name of Lord Rāma." //Sahasra, sahasra, Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma.// And if you chant three times Lord Rāma's name, it is equal to one time chanting Kṛṣṇa's name. This is the //śāstric// injunction.

So either you chant Viṣṇu name or Lord Rāma name or Lord Kṛṣṇa's name, there is no difference, as you are, because different people become devotee to different forms. Sometimes they are devotee of Lord Rāmacandra; they want to worship Sītā-Rāma. That is also good. Sometimes they want to worship Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. That is also good. And sometimes they want to worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. That is also the same. There is no difference. //Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu, kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat// [Bs. 5.39]. There are many manifestation of Viṣṇu---//advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]---but the original manifestation or original Kṛṣṇa... //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. Really, when we speak of Bhagavān, that is Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa's expansion, they are also Bhagavān. And those who are very, very powerful, like Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, Nārada and many other devotees and sages, they are also sometimes addressed as Bhagavān in the //śāstra.// But not ordinary men. Ordinary men cannot become Bhagavān. That is not possible. But everyone can become exalted devotee. Just like Nārada Muni. In his previous birth he was a maidservant's son, not even born in the //brāhmaṇa// family. But by good association of devotees he became next birth Nārada Muni, the spiritual master of so many exalted devotees. Nārada Muni's name we hear in connection with Prahlāda Mahārāja, Dhruva Mahārāja and many other devotees. And so everyone has the potency, just like Nārada Muni. So it doesn't matter where you were born---Nārada Muni was born as a maidservant's son---but by good association... //Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvidaḥ.// By good association, next life he became Nārada.

So the //sat-saṅga// is very important, association. Therefore we have named this "Kṛṣṇa conscious society." Anyone can join it. It doesn't matter what he is. And actually, it is... Practically we are doing. We are collecting, recruiting members from all parts of the world without any distinction. The distinction is there in the material platform. In the spiritual platform there is no such distinction. //Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. //Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// That is the vision of the devotees. They see only the spirit soul, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Their sympathy is for the spirit soul, that "Here is a spirit soul, and he is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. He is now bound up by this material bondage. Let me try to rescue him." Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //śoce tato vimukha-cetasa, māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. They have become foolish. They are thinking that in material bondage he will be happy. That is not possible. Therefore Vaiṣṇavas like Prahlāda Mahārāja and his followers, they very seriously think of these fallen conditioned souls and try to rescue them. And in this Kali-yuga it is very easy. As I have already explained, //kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ:// "In this Kali-yuga it is a ocean of fault. So many faults are there, one after another, one after another. But there is one benefit," //doṣa-nidhe asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ,// "very great quality." What is that? Now, //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet:// "He hasn't got to do anything else. If he simply chants the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,//" //kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya// [SB 12.3.51], "then he becomes free from this material bondage and goes back to home, back to Godhead." So our only request is to everyone present here to chant this //mahā-mantra,//

> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare
> Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare

Thank you very much. Chant.
