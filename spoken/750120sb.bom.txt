"Odor, although one, becomes many---as mixed, offensive, fragrant, mild, strong, acidic and so on---according to the proportions of associated substances."

**Prabhupāda:**

In the previous verse the //gandha,// from //gandha,// from smell, fragrance or smell, //ghrāṇas tu gandhagaḥ// [[books:sb:3:26:44|[SB 3.26.44]]]. So in the smelling power, nostril, they perceive different varieties. Variety is there. Although the thing is one, one Kṛṣṇa, but even in His material energy, He is perceived in varieties of things. That is the purpose of this Sāṅkhya philosophy, how one has become many, //ekaṁ bahu syām.//

So intelligence is to know the one as well as the varieties. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca// [Bs. 5.33]. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they simply take one side, oneness. //Ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti.// That is fact. //Dvitī...// There is no //dvitīya. Dvitīyābhiniveśa// means //māyā.// Everywhere, Kṛṣṇa is there. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. The materialistic scientists, they take the ultimate cause of this material world: the atom. Now this atomic theory, //paramāṇu. Paramāṇu.// You have seen the //paramāṇu.// In your room, if there is a hole and sunshine is coming through that hole, you will find in that sunshine, sun rays, there are millions of small particles. That is called //paramāṇu. Aṇu, paramāṇu.// So then there is //aṇu// also, smaller than that. Six //aṇus// combined together becomes a //paramāṇu.// So the //paramāṇuvāda...// I forget the //ṛṣi's// name who propounded the philosophy of //paramāṇuvāda,// that the material creation is combination of these atomic particles, //paramāṇuvāda.// But now the scientists, they are studying the //paramāṇu,// atom, also. They are finding still subtle elements. They say "proton" and "electron," like that, still finer. In this way you cannot go ultimately to the finest material being. And even if you go, still, there is no solution. You will find something else within it working.

So that something else, ultimately if we can realize, that is Kṛṣṇa. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. Kṛṣṇa is there even within the //paramāṇu,// electrons, protons. There is; He is there. //Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 1.2.20]. Kṛṣṇa showed Arjuna the //virāḍ-rūpa,// the gigantic universal form. So one side He is universally represented, //virāḍ-rūpa.// And in another side He is within the //aṇu paramāṇu,// smaller than the //aṇu,// smaller than the //paramāṇu. Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān.// That is Kṛṣṇa. //Mahīyān.// But these are all material forms. In the //Bhagavad-gītā,// you will find in the Eleventh Chapter, Arjuna is requesting to come to His original form. So he was very much threatened, or frightened, and he requested, "This form is very much unbearable to see. Please come to Your original form." So Kṛṣṇa first of all came to His form, four-handed Viṣṇu form; then again He came into His two-handed Kṛṣṇa form, and that is the ultimate, real form of Kṛṣṇa.

Kṛṣṇa has got many forms. Every form is Kṛṣṇa's form. That's a fact. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam// [Bs. 5.33]. Some of the forms are personal, some of the forms are of His potencies, //śakti,// but all forms belong to Kṛṣṇa. So some of them are material forms, and whatever differentiation of forms we see in the material world, they are all Kṛṣṇa's form. But in the spiritual world there are also many forms---just like Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma, then Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Nārāyaṇa, and the //puruṣa-avatāra.// There are many. And there are innumerable planets also. In each and every planet there is one form. And when incarnation comes, one of the forms from Vaikuṇṭha, They come as incarnation. So, many forms are called //svāṁśa.// In the //Varāha Purāṇa// you will find the description of the forms: //svāṁśa// and //vibhinnāṁśa.// The forms exhibited in this material world as living being, they are //vibhinnāṁśa. Bhinnā prakṛtir me aṣṭadhā.// As there are separated energies, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]], the five elements, material elements, //mahā-bhūta,// they are also forms of Kṛṣṇa. This big mountain, Himalayan mountain, that is also form of Kṛṣṇa. The big Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, that is also form of Kṛṣṇa. He says, //bhūmir āpaḥ. Āpaḥ. Āpaḥ// means water. So not only water in this planet, but there are millions and trillions of Pacific Ocean bigger than that in other planets. So, inconceivable. Therefore God is inconceivable, //acintya. Acintya-guṇa. Acintya,// inconceivable.

So in this way Kṛṣṇa is existing. //Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca// [Bs. 5.33]. But the original form is Kṛṣṇa. //Aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. That is original form. That form is existing in Vṛndāvana. And other forms, they are distributed. //Goloka eva nivasati.// Actually, Kṛṣṇa is living in His original form in Goloka Vṛndāvana. This form, Kṛṣṇa, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, this is the form in Goloka Vṛndāvana. //Veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣam// [Bs. 5.30]. In the spiritual world there is no such thing as killing the Kaṁsa, Hiraṇyakaśipu. That is in the material world. Kṛṣṇa is in twelve different varieties of taste: //śānta, dāsya, sākhya, vātsalya, mādhurya, bhayānaka, bībhatsa, hāsya,// the so many, twelve. In the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu// it is..., Kṛṣṇa is worshiped there that //akhila-rasāmṛta, akhila.// There are many kinds of taste, and that taste are all combined together in Kṛṣṇa, //akhila-rasāmṛta.// In the //Vedas// it is said, //raso vai saḥ. Rasa// means mellow. So we have presented a little book, //Kṛṣṇa Is the Reservoir of All Pleasure. Rasa// means pleasure, taste, pleasing taste, //rasa,// or humor. Everyone has got different taste. So all the taste are there in Kṛṣṇa. //Raso vai saḥ, labdhvānandī.// Anyone who has tasted Kṛṣṇa, he gets real taste of pleasure, either in this //rasa// or that //rasa.//

Just like Bhīṣma. Bhīṣma was fighting with Kṛṣṇa. He had no business fighting with Kṛṣṇa, because He is charioteer. But sometimes the horses, the charioteer also killed by the opposing party. So when Arjuna was in a very dangerous position... Because Bhīṣma promised to Duryodhana. Duryodhana was criticizing his grandfather, that "You are not fighting wholeheartedly. Because your affection is there on the other side, your other grandsons, //pañca-pāṇḍava,// therefore you are not fighting with your full strength." So this is a great insult for the //kṣatriya.// So he promised to kill the five Pāṇḍavas next day. That was a challenge to Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa promised that He will not fight in the battle, and Bhīṣma promised that "Unless Kṛṣṇa fights and protects His friend, Arjuna, he could not be saved. I will fight in that way." So he was fighting in that way, and Arjuna's chariot became broken into pieces, and he was in danger. And Kṛṣṇa could understand that "Bhīṣma wants Me to fight on account of Arjuna; otherwise he would not be saved."

So to please Bhīṣma---not that it was necessary to fight with Bhīṣma, but because Bhīṣma wanted that "Either Kṛṣṇa must fight or His friend Arjuna must die"---therefore Kṛṣṇa decided... Not to... He could save His friend Arjuna in any way. But in order to show Bhīṣma that "Yes, He is fighting. He has broken His promise..." He promised that He would not fight, but Bhīṣma promised that either He should fight or His friend would die. So therefore He prepared to fight. But superficially, He did not take His original disc. He took only one broken wheel of the chariot, and taking it, He was going to kill Bhīṣma just to show him, "You promised that I would fight, so now I have taken this fighting weapon. Now you can stop. Otherwise you will be killed." So he stopped. He could understand. But while Kṛṣṇa was coming to kill him with that broken piece of wheel, that was very pleasing to him, Bhīṣma. At that time Bhīṣma was piercing with sharpened arrow the body of Kṛṣṇa. So He was pleasing, He was feeling very pleasure, being pierced by the arrow of Bhīma [Bhīṣma]. So //bhakti// transaction... There are many kinds of //bhakti// transaction. And at the time of Bhīṣma's death he was thinking of Kṛṣṇa: in His fighting spirit He was coming to kill him. That is in Bhīṣma's prayer. There is in the //Bhāgavata.// He was not thinking of Kṛṣṇa with flute. He was thinking of Kṛṣṇa with the broken chariot wheel and was coming to kill him. That form was very pleasing to him. So we can reciprocate all kinds of //rasas,// humor, because He is the reservoir of all //rasas.// So this is the //rasa// of chivalry, the fighting spirit.

So everything is there. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. The Absolute Truth is that where all varieties are there, variety. Although He is one, but still, varieties are there. Otherwise, wherefrom the varieties come? Everything, all varieties. You see in the material world how many varieties are there. You take one bunch of flower. You will find, if you study minutely, how many hundreds and thousands of varieties of thorns, varieties of twigs, and color, and everything is there, variety. How these varieties are coming? The //Vedānta// replies, "From the Absolute Truth, varieties." //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. The Supreme Absolute Truth has got so many varieties of energies. For each and every variety, particular, finer craftsmanship, there is different energy. They are working. Just like we require to present some varieties, a specialist, so Kṛṣṇa Himself has got all the special varieties of energy, and they are working in such a nice way as //svābhāvikī.// He hasn't got to learn it. //Svābhāvikī. Svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]. //Jñāna,// knowledge. Suppose if you want to paint something, you must have the knowledge of painting, //jñāna.// And strength and activity---everything.

So Kṛṣṇa, anything He is creator. Therefore He is perfect, all-opulent. Anything that requires to be created... You can create. We have got the creative energy. Because we are also part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, the creative energy is there---but not in fullness. Kṛṣṇa's variety of energy, that is full of potency.

> aiśvaryasya samagrasya
> vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ
> jñāna-vairāgyayoś caiva
> ṣaṇṇāṁ itī bhaga ganā
> [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]

These are called //bhaga,// opulence. So the all the opulences... For creating a nice flower, that is being manufactured by Kṛṣṇa. With His brain the seed of the flower is a chemical composition so nicely made. //Svābhāvikī jñāna,// He knows. Naturally He knows how to make the seed perfect so that from the seed, by sowing in the soil, by watering, the whole varieties will come. Is there any scientist to put in a small seed all the chemicals, and it will come automatically a motorcar? No. That is not possible. That is not possible. You have to create every car. And Kṛṣṇa's energy is so perfect that she has created one male body and one female body, and innumerable cars are coming. This is car, described in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// this body. //Yantra. Yantrārūḍhāni māyayā// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. This is //yantra,// but this //yantra// is coming by union of two //yantras:// one male //yantra// and female //yantra.// And millions of //yantras// are coming. Where is that capacity?

So one gentleman, he challenged me. He's atheistic class. He said, "What is Kṛṣṇa's intelligence? It is just like an watch. If you wind the watch, it goes and gives time. Similarly, it is just like a machine---the whole world is going on." That's all right. Still, you are lacking knowledge, because Kṛṣṇa hasn't got to prepare each and every watch. He has made two watches, male and female, and they are producing. That is Kṛṣṇa's intelligence. Therefore even if you supposed to be very intelligent, still, you are lacking intelligence. You cannot be as intelligent as Kṛṣṇa. There must be some less quantity. Just like Yaśodāmāyi wanted to bind Kṛṣṇa with ropes, and as soon as she was going to knot it, there was little difference.

So we may be very intelligent scientifically or mathematically or physically, biologically. That's all right. But when we compare with the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa, it is less by two cubits. It is less. That we should always understand. //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. We have to accept this, that we cannot excel the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. I may show varieties of magic and declare myself Kṛṣṇa, or God, but still, you cannot show as perfectly magical arts as Kṛṣṇa is showing. That is not possible. If we understand this fact and realize it, then we can understand what is Kṛṣṇa, //janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa---there is little value like Kṛṣṇa---but we can never be equal with Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Asamordhva. Nobody can be equal with Kṛṣṇa; nobody can be greater than Kṛṣṇa. Everyone is lower than Kṛṣṇa. So this intelligence is real intelligence, and if we think that equal to Kṛṣṇa or greater than Kṛṣṇa, that is all //māyā.// Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvair mohitaṁ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam [[books:bg:7:13|[Bg. 7.13]]].

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to know that no more greater than Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is greater than Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is equal to Kṛṣṇa. If we understand this much perfectly... We cannot understand perfectly, because that is not possible. Kṛṣṇa is unlimited. But as far as we have got our knowledge, if we understand this fact, that "I can never become equal with Kṛṣṇa; neither I can become greater than Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. I will have to remain always subordinate to Kṛṣṇa," this is called //mukti,// liberation. We are entrapped in this material bondage by illusory understanding. So when we come to the right understanding, that "My position is always subordinate to Kṛṣṇa," that is called //mukti.// Anyone can become a //mukta,// liberated person, as soon as he agrees to this philosophy that he is always subordinate to Kṛṣṇa, or God; he is never equal to Him nor greater than Him. //Asama-ūrdhva.// And those who are thinking that they are equal with Kṛṣṇa, that is //māyā. Māyā mohitaṁ nābhijānāti.// They do not know their actual... But when he comes to the knowledge, //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ...// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. That is required.

If you want to become //mahātmā// really, then you have to come to this point, to understand the..., originally, the Vāsudeva is the supreme cause of all causes. That is perfection of life. And our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to teach this knowledge to the world, the best welfare activities. They are all in illusion. Some of them are thinking there is no Kṛṣṇa, and some of them are thinking, "If there is Kṛṣṇa"---Kṛṣṇa means God---"I am also God. I am equal." And some of them are thinking that "By meditation, by spiritual advancement, now I am greater than Kṛṣṇa." Yes. They are not, neither equal nor below, but they are thinking greater than Him: with the progress of time the human being is advancing in knowledge; so by their meditational power, they can become greater than Kṛṣṇa. So that is foolishness. That is not possible. This is also //māyā.// Just like //māyā// is acting in so many ways. Sometimes we are thinking, "There is no Kṛṣṇa, no God. We are, every one of us, are God." Similarly, to think of greater than Kṛṣṇa is another illusionary curtain of //māyā. Māyā// is not getting you out very easily. He will put so many impediments. Therefore //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]: "After many, many births, when actually becomes wise, then he understands that 'I am nothing. Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, He is everything.' " //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti.// Then that is not oneness; dual: "Vāsudeva, and I am." //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā.//

So //mahātmā// and Vāsudeva, there are two. The //mahātmā// realizing Vāsudeva, and Vāsudeva is everywhere. And that is perfection of life. A person who realizes Vāsudeva in that way... Vāsudeva means everything lives on somebody. Vāsudeva. So Kṛṣṇa says, //mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]: "Everything is resting on Me, but still, it appears that I am not there." This is illusory energy. //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]], that's a fact. Vāsudeva is everywhere. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. Simply we have to purify our senses to understand the presence of Vāsudeva. That is required. And that is possible if we increase our loving tendency to love Kṛṣṇa. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. If we increase our loving propensity... That is already there, but now it is intervened by the //māyā// cloud. So we have to get out of the cloud. Then we will find //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. So that is called purificatory process.

So this purificatory process means this devotional service. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. Vāsudeva reveals. You cannot... By your force, you cannot see Him. But He is pleased, //sevonmukhe hi jihvādau,// when you accept to serve Him by your tongue, beginning with tongue, //kīrtanam.// You glorify Kṛṣṇa. You taste Kṛṣṇa's //prasādam// with devotion and service. Then you realize Vāsudeva very easily. //Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:136|[Cc. Madhya 17.136]]]. These blunt senses, they cannot realize. But when the senses are purified, //hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the process by which you can purify, sanctify your senses. And then, when your senses are engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, beginning with the tongue, then your life becomes perfect.

Thank you very much.
