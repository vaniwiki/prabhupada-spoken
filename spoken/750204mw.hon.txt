====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
I remember those days immediately when I see the sea.

**Haṁsadūta:**
You were getting seasick?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I liked it. Although I was sick, still, I liked it. Day and night, for thirty-five days.

**Haṁsadūta:**
I came to America in the same way, but I was always sick. I didn't like it.

**Prabhupāda:**
The sea journey is very good, provided there is no sea-sickness. Otherwise very bad. [//japa//]

[break] ...all of our books in different languages. At least all the European languages. America is one language.

**Gurukṛpa:**
South America.

**Prabhupāda:**
South America, different languages. Spanish.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Spanish, Portuguese.

**Prabhupāda:**
[//japa//] What about that Japanese translation? Something is done or not?

**Gurukṛpa:**
Just a magazine.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. His wife was translating Japanese?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes she is [indistinct]... It has to be checked over.

**Gurukṛpa:**
There is a girl in Tokyo who is very expert.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
She's doing?

**Gurukṛpa:**
She's been doing the magazine. She can do more. [break]

**Jayatīrtha:**
It says. Yesterday Nitāi found a quote from the //Purāṇas// that says, "There are many //gurus// who will take away your money, but rare is the one who will take away your miseries."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Guravo bahavaḥ santi vittāpahārakaḥ.//

**Nitāi:**
Yes, right.

**Prabhupāda:**

> guravo bahavaḥ
> santi vittāpahārakaḥ
> taṁ tu guruṁ na paśyāmi
> śiṣya-santā-pahārakāḥ

"There are many //gurus,// they are very expert in plundering disciple's money, but it is very difficult to find out the //guru// who can take out all the anxieties of the disciple."

//Śiṣya santa-pahārakāḥ. Guru// is meant for taking away the //santāpa. Saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kārunya-ghanāghanatvam.// "The //śiṣya// will be peaceful"---objective of life---that is the business of //guru,// not to take away his money.

**Haṁsadūta:**
In one lecture you were explaining those prayers, //saṁsāra,// and you said the first business of the //guru// is to take away the anxiety of the disciple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Now our people, they have got some hope that they're going back to home, back to Godhead. And all other rascal---zero. So who is endeavoring for zero? What is this endeavor?

**Haṁsadūta:**
There's nothing to do for that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. In //Bhāgavata// also---//gurur na sa syāt// [[books:sb:5:5:18|[SB 5.5.18]]]. He should not be //guru// unless he is able to protect his disciple from the imminent danger of death. //Na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.// This cycle of birth and death is going on. //Guru's// business is how to stop this cycle of birth and death. And it is not very difficult. Teach him to understand Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is assuring, "If anyone understands Me nicely, then after giving up this body he comes to Me." Where is the difficulty? Give him Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and he is saved from birth and death. There is nothing wonderful. There is no jugglery. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. [break] ...only institution for mitigating the sufferings of humanity. But they don't know what is the real suffering of his life. //Dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.// That is the real suffering---cycle of birth and death. //Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. These rascals, they do not know what is the goal of life, //svārtha,// self-interest. Unless he comes to Viṣṇu, there is no question of //svārtha-gati.//

[break] ...reclaim this portion, eh? [break] ...strong and stout. Not all. [break] Yesterday it was a very nice city, and today it is finished. This is called //māyā.// [break] And there is no God. Just see how intelligent they are. To pour water whole night, thousands of miles, can the scientists arrange? So who is arranging for that? His father? His father, of course, arranges, but he does not agree to offer respect to the father. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpananda:**
Another boy in a different place, householder, his business is making surfboards for a living. He builds the surfboards, and he puts pictures, big pictures of Kṛṣṇa, Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva, on the surfboard so that when the boys are sitting on the board, like you saw that boy sitting on the surfboard, all day long they are looking at the picture.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpānanda:**
//Tulasī// grows profusely in Hawaii, and they...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's a good sign.

**Siddha-svarūpānanda:**
Yes. Many people, hundreds of people, are worshiping //tulasī.// Even people we don't know, they, somehow or other, they have gotten //tulasī,// and they are worshiping.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. They will become devotee. Without any fail, they will become devotees. If they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and worship //tulasī// leaf, they'll be liberated without any fail, and they will become devotee. [break] ...gradually appreciate. [break]

**Kīrtanānanda:**
But the little boy, the three-year-old boy, he appreciates very much. He loves your books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday on //saṅkīrtana// I was distributing a book to someone, and when he saw your picture he said, "Ah, yes, in 1966 I chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa."

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Yaśodānandana:**
And he took a book because he saw your picture.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, 1966, I was chanting in San Francisco.

**Yaśodānandana:**
He said he chanted with you and your disciples on Second Avenue.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yaśodānandana:**
He said he was fifteen then.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that, Tompkinson? No?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Tompkins Square Park.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Many, many people came to that storefront.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Oh, yes, it was packed.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Packed every night, seventy-five, eighty people. [break]

**Jayatīrtha:**
I went to that New York storefront first of all, and I was a Māyāvā... Well, I was a rascal. So they called me a rascal, so I became very offended. [laughs] Later on, I saw that they were right.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you called them rascal? No.

**Jayatīrtha:**
No. I knew that they were not rascals. They looked very pure. I just left. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The sunshine has covered 93,000,000 miles all round, so the sunshine is big or the sun is big?

**Kīrtanānanda:**
The potency is in the sun.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is big, not the Brahmān. And within the sun globe there is sun-god, Vivasvān. They do not know all this. They think the sunshine is big...

**Gurukṛpa:**
The sun is separate from Vivasvān?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurukṛpa:**
The sun is different than Vivasvān?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not different. Just like the sunshine is not different from the sun globe. Sun globe means all the inhabitants there, they're glowing. Therefore the whole planet is glowing.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Vivasvān, he is...?

**Prabhupāda:**
He is also glowing.

**Gurukṛpa:**
He will stay as long as the sun..., he is present?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, he has got a duration of life. When the creation will be annihilated, he'll be annihilated. He'll be not annihilated. Nobody is annihilated, but he's not manifest. Nonmanifest. He is demigod. The demigods, with the annihilation of the material world, they will be all finished. But Kṛṣṇa will remain there. //Aham eva āsam agre// [[books:sb:2:9:33|[SB 2.9.33]]]. And He will be remained. He was in the beginning of creation, and at the end of creation He'll be there.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Prabhupāda, in the //Bhāgavatam// it is mentioned, //sarva-devāmayo guruḥ// [SB 11.17.27]. What is the meaning?

**Prabhupāda:**
"//Guru// is the representation of all gods and demigods."

**Haṁsadūta:**
Prabhupāda, in Vṛndāvana you were explaining about the sun, that the sun is not fire, but the living entities there have glowing bodies. So how do they glow? I mean... You said it was not the glow of the soul, but it was...

**Prabhupāda:**
How do you not glow? [laughter] How? God has made you not glowing, and He has made them glowing. That's all. //Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam// [Bs. 5.1].

**Haṁsadūta:**
Well I mean to say is there a difference between...? Just like we have fire here, is it different from the glowing there? You said the sun is not fire.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. No, without fire how there can be glow?

**Haṁsadūta:**
So they have fiery bodies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Haṁsadūta:**
But when we see fire here, is it also living in that way? Some living entity?

**Prabhupāda:**
Within fire? Yes. That is //agni-po//[?]. Just like you have got microbes and germs in water, similarly, there are microbes and germs in fire also. //Acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam// [[books:bg:2:24|[Bg. 2.24]]]. That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā, adāhyaḥ:// "It is not burned by fire." Everything, information, is there. Therefore our knowledge is perfect. Take from the perfect source of knowledge, //Acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam aśleṣya, aśoṣya.// [end]
