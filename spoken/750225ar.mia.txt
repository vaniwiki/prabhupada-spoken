**Prabhupāda:**
So I am very glad to see this Miami temple. Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda has come here. It is great fortune for you. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared for delivering all kinds of fallen souls in this age. Śrīla Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings, //pāpī-tāpī yāta chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo, tāra sākṣī jagāi// and //mādhāi.// So //brajendra-nandana yei, śacī-suta hoilo sei, balarāma hoilo nitāi.// The same Kṛṣṇa and same Balarāma... Kṛṣṇa has appeared as the son of mother Śacī, and Balarāma has appeared as Nityānanda, and Their business is to deliver all fallen souls, especially in this age, Kali-yuga. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission was that He should be present by His name, by His form, by His pastime, in every town and village of the world. And you are fulfilling His mission. So undoubtedly, you will be blessed and you will get Kṛṣṇa's mercy through the mercy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

To understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy thing.

Out of many thousands, millions people, one is anxious to make his life successful. Nobody is interested. Practically they do not know what is actually success of life. The modern civilization, everyone is thinking, "If I get a good wife and nice motorcar and a nice apartment, that is success." That is not success. That is temporary. Real success is to get out of the clutches of //māyā,// means this material conditional life which comprehends birth, death, old age and disease. We are passing through many varieties of life, and this human form of life is a good chance to get out of this chain of changing body one after another.

The soul is eternal and blissful because part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, God---//sac-cid-ānanda,// eternal, full of bliss, full of knowledge. Unfortunately, in this material, conditional life we are changing different bodies, but we are not getting situated again in that spiritual platform where there is no birth, no death. There is no science. The other day one psychiatrist came to see me. "And where is your education for understanding the soul, his constitutional position?" So practically the whole world is in darkness. They are interested with fifty, sixty or hundred years of this span of life, but they do not know that we are eternal, blissful and full of knowledge, and due to this material body we are subjected to birth, death, old age and disease. And this is going on continuously.

So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, out of His great compassion for the fallen souls, He appeared. Kṛṣṇa comes also, but Kṛṣṇa is not so liberal. Kṛṣṇa makes condition, that "First of all you surrender. Then I take charge of you." But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is more compassionate than Kṛṣṇa, although Kṛṣṇa and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the same thing. So by Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mercy we are so easily understanding Kṛṣṇa. So that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is present here. You worship Him. It is not very difficult. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ. Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam, yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanam// [SB 11.5.32]. You simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// and whatever you can, offer Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He is very kind. He does not take offense. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa worship is little difficult. We have to worship Him with great awe and veneration. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu has voluntarily come to deliver the fallen souls. Little service, He will be satisfied. He will be satisfied. But do not neglect. Because He is very kind and compassionate, that does not mean we should forget His position. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, so we should offer Him very great respect, and as far as possible... But the advantage is that Caitanya Mahāprabhu does not take any offense. And to worship Him, to please Him, is very easy. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtanaiḥ prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ.// Simply you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// and dance, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu will be very pleased. He introduced this dancing and chanting, and this is the easiest process for God realization. So as far as possible... If possible, twenty-four hours. If that is not possible, at least four times, six times, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// before Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and you will get success in your life. This is a fact.

So I am very glad that you are worshiping Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu. So continue to do this. There is no need of installing Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, at least at the present moment. When you become more advanced in spiritual consciousness, you can establish. But even if you do not establish, it doesn't matter. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is sufficient. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādhā-kṛṣṇa nahe anya.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu is combination of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. In one place you worship Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa. So I see this place is very nice, and you are also very nice. Take advantage of this opportunity and go on chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// and worship Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He will bless you sufficiently to become successful in getting shelter of the lotus feet of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.

Thank you very much.
