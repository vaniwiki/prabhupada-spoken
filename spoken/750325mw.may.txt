====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...you take away money for serving //daridra-nārāyaṇa.// When you go to India, we see all //daridra-nārāyaṇas// are lying down on the footpath. What do you do with this money? Swami Nikhilānanda personally told me that they now enquire.

**Acyutānanda:**
He died there last year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Oh, here is another skyscraper?

**Karandhara:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Multi-stories.

**Gurukṛpā:**
I think in India they're only fogscraper. They are not very high.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, fog?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Fogscraper, not very high.

**Prabhupāda:**
