====== Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā 1.2 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

"I offer my respectful obeisances unto Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda, who are like the sun and moon. They have arisen simultaneously on the horizon of Gauḍa to dissipate the darkness of ignorance and thus wonderfully bestow benediction upon all."

**Prabhupāda:**

> vande śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nityāndandau sahoditau
> gauḍodaye puṣpavantau
> citrau śandau tamo-nudau
> [[books:cc:adi:1:2|[Cc. Ādi 1.2]]]

So yesterday we discussed the first verse,

> gurūn īśa-bhaktān
> īśam īśāvatārakān
> tat-prakāśāṁś ca tac-chaktiḥ
> kṛṣṇa-caitanya-saṁjñakam
> [[books:cc:adi:1:1|[Cc. Ādi 1.1]]]

Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya, He has got manyfold expansion. The first expansion is //prakāśa, svayaṁ-prakāśa,// Balarāma. And Nityānanda is Balarāma. //Vrajendra-nandana yei, śacī-sūta hoilo sei, balarāma hoilo nitāi.// We have to understand from the //mahājana,// Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. Sometimes some foolish people interpret Nityānanda as expansion of Rādhārāṇī, but that is not the fact. Nityānanda is Balarāma. We have to know from //mahājana.// We cannot manufacture our own idea. That is blasphemy, //sahajiyā. Yata mat tata pat.// These things are not accepted by //mahājana. Mahājana// means who follows the previous //mahājana.// This is the system. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu strictly followed this principle. Kṛṣṇa also recommended, //evaṁ paramparā-prāptam// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. We have to receive knowledge through the disciplic succession, //mahājana-gataḥ.// You cannot manufacture. This concoction has killed the spiritual life of India. "You can think any way; I can think in my way"---that is not at all scientific. You cannot think, "Two plus two equal to three" or "five." "Two plus two equal to four." You cannot think otherwise.

[people talking in background] [aside:] Ask them to stop.

So Nityānanda means //prakāśa, svayaṁ-prakāśa,// Balarāma. Balarāma is, I mean to say, presenting Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Balarāma is //guru-tattva. Guru// is representative of Balarāma, of Nityānanda, Guru Nityānanda, because He is exhibiting Kṛṣṇa. He is presenting Kṛṣṇa, //prakāśa.// Just like when there is sunshine you can see everything very correctly. That is called //prakāśa.// In the darkness everything is covered. At night we cannot see, but during daytime, when there is //prakāśa,// illumination, then we can see everything. So Nityānanda Prabhu is Balarāma. Balarāma is //prakāśa-tattva.// He's manifesting Kṛṣṇa. //Balarāma hoila nitāi.// So //vande śrī...// Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya is the Supreme Absolute Personality of Godhead, and next, Nityānanda, or..., yes, Nityānanda, is exhibiting Him. When Nityānanda was preaching in Bengal, He first of all delivered the Jagāi and Mādhāi. That was his first business. He showed how to serve Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya means Kṛṣṇa Himself. //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya rādha-kṛṣṇa nahe anya// [//Śrī Guru-paramparā// 6]. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa combined together is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. And Nityānanda is exhibiting Kṛṣṇa Caitanyadeva.

So how one can exhibit Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that is... By His personal example Nityānanda Prabhu has given us lesson. When Caitanya Mahāprabhu was sending His devotees to preach and Nityānanda Prabhu was doing that, He used to go with Haridāsa Ṭhākura to preach on the street, home to home. So when they saw there was a big crowd on the street, so Nityānanda Prabhu inquired from the people, "Why there is so many people assembled?" So He was informed that "There are two //gundas,// rogues. They are creating some trouble." The //gundas,// their business is to create trouble, that's all. Every one of us we know, especially at the present moment in Bengal. Yes. This is due to lack of preaching of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Nityānanda Prabhu is not given the chance. Nityānanda Prabhu is very eager to preach, but He's not given chance. Actually, those who are proud of becoming descendants of Nityānanda Prabhu... In Bengal there is a family, they say that they are descendants from Nityānanda Prabhu. So apart from controversy, even accepting that they are descendants from Nityānanda Prabhu, their business is also to act like Nityānanda Prabhu. So that business... What is that business? That is described by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, //mahājana, pāpī tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo, ta'ra sākṣī jagāi-mādhāi.// This is the business of Nityānanda Prabhu along with Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Vrajendra-nandana yei, śacī-sūta hoilo sei, balarāma hoilo nitāi.//

So here Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and Nityānanda, Their identification is Lord Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma. Now, in the Kṛṣṇa incarnation, these two brothers were engaged as cowherds boy and friends of the //gopīs,// sons of Mother Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja. That is actual life in Vṛndāvana. Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, They are village cowherds boy. That is the early age history of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. And Their another business, when They went to Mathurā, They killed Kaṁsa and the wrestlers, and then again, when They went to Dvārakā, They had to fight with so many demons. But Their childhood life, up to sixteenth year, They were in Vṛndāvana, happy life, simply love. That is //paritrāṇāya sādhūnām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. //Sādhus,// devotees, they are always anxious to see Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma and Their associates. They are always very much aggrieved on account of separation. To give them rejuvenation of life, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma play Their childhood days in Vṛndāvana. And out of Vṛndāvana, beginning from Mathurā up to Dvārakā and other places, the business was //vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām:// killing. So They have got two businesses: one for pacifying the devotees, and the other is to kill the demons. Of course, Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma, They are Absolute Truth. There is no difference between killing and loving. They... Absolute. Those who were killed, you know, they were also delivered from this material bondage.

Now these same two brothers have again descended, as Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya-Nityānanda. //Sahoditau:// simultaneously They have appeared. Not that one is appeared, another is not there. No. Both of Them, //sahoditau.// And They are compared with the sun and moon. The business of sun and moon is to dissipate darkness. The sun rises during daytime, and the moon rises at night. But this sun and moon, wonderful sun and moon, //citrau,// They have appeared together. But the business is the same, //tamo-nudau.// Business is to dissipate darkness, because we are in darkness. We, anyone who is in this material world, he's in darkness. Darkness means ignorant, no knowledge. They are mostly animals. "Why they are animals, so civilized men, so well dressed and university education degrees? Why they are in darkness?" Yes, they are in darkness. "What is the proof?" The proof is that they are not Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is the proof. That is their darkness. Ask anybody, item by item, that... Ask, what do they know about Kṛṣṇa. Everyone is ignorant, dark. So that is the proof. How this is proof? Now, Kṛṣṇa says. We do not say; Kṛṣṇa says. How does He say? //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. //Apahṛta-jñānā// means that although they have got university degrees, although they are called civilized, advanced in material civilization, but //māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.// Their degrees, because they do not know Kṛṣṇa thoroughly and therefore do not surrender to Kṛṣṇa, which Kṛṣṇa is canvassing personally, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja...// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He's personally canvassing. Because these rascals and fools, they are in darkness---they do not know what is the goal of life---Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He is canvassing, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.// This is the philosophy. So still they are not doing so. Why? //Narādhamāḥ.// Because the lowest of the mankind, //narādhama.// How they have become //narādhama?// Now, //duṣkṛtina,// always committing sinful life. What is sinful life? Illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Because they are addicted to these things they are //duṣkṛtina// and //narādhama,// lowest of the mankind. And whatever knowledge they are acquiring by so-called education, that is false knowledge. //Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.// This is the position.

So Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya and Nityānanda, They came, descended again, being merciful, same Kṛṣṇa. //Vrajendra-nandana yei, śacī-sūta hoilo sei.// Same Kṛṣṇa. In a different way They canvassed the same principle.

[aside:] You can sit down there. You are sleeping. Don't sleep. Don't show that sleeping.

**Devotee:**
Stand up.

**Prabhupāda:**
Go there. So this is the darkness. And Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared to drive away this darkness---same Kṛṣṇa, the same principle. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's preaching and Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's preaching. There is no difference. The difference is that Kṛṣṇa, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He is demanding that "You rascal, you surrender unto Me. You are suffering so much. You are rascal. I am your father. I want to see you happy; therefore I have come. Surrender unto Me. I shall give you all protection." //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. "You are suffering on account of your //duṣkṛti,// all sinful activities. Whatever you are doing, all sinful activities."

Except Kṛṣṇa consciousness activities, whatever you do, that is sinful activity. But they have been summarized into four principles. The whole sinful activities of the world, they have been summarized in four lines: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxication. This is the summary. But otherwise, of these activities there are many, many branches. But if you cut the root of sinful activities---this illicit sex and gambling and meat-eating---then generally, automatically other sinful activities will go. Therefore we who are propagating Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are just requesting that you give up this sinful life. Otherwise you will be implicated again.

What is that implication? The implication is that your sinful life will get you next body which is also sinful. And again you suffer. Suffering there is. As soon as you get material body, there is suffering. It may be a king's body or it may be a cobbler's body, it doesn't matter, the suffering is there. But because these people are //māyayāpahṛta-jñānā,// they are accepting suffering as pleasure. This is called //māyā.// He's suffering, but he is thinking it is a good pleasure. Just like the pig. He's eating stool, and he's thinking he's enjoying life. This is called ignorant. He does not know that he's suffering. //Māyā// has given his body to suffer, but even in the pig's body, he's thinking that is enjoying life. This is called //māyā. Mohitaṁ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam// [[books:bg:7:13|[Bg. 7.13]]]. This is called illusion. Illusion. Everyone in this material world, they are suffering in different grades. Just like in the prison house there are different grades of prisoner: first class, second class, third class. But if the first-class prisoner thinks they are enjoying life, that is ignorance. He should know that he's in the prison house. In the prison house where is there enjoyment? It is all suffering. Maybe first-class suffering, [laughter] but it is suffering. So they are all in the darkness, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu appeared to dissipate, //tamo-nudau,// to dissipate this darkness of the whole human society. That is Their kindness. They are...

So Nityānanda Prabhu, being //prakāśā,// He is manifesting Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He's canvassing the same thing. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is canvassing to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness through the mercy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda Prabhu and Their other assistants is easier. Easier. Therefore we see practically, we have taught our disciples to chant first of all the Pañca-tattva, //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya// [devotees chant] //prabhu-nityānanda, śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.// Thank you. So through the mercy of this Pañca-tattva, easily you can approach Kṛṣṇa. Easily. Otherwise how it is possible? These Europeans, Americans, they did not know what is Kṛṣṇa. Four or five years ago they were unknown. How they have become so devotee of Kṛṣṇa that ten thousand miles, crossing over the sea, they have come here at Māyāpur, unless they have got developed love for this? Their coming is not so easy from neighboring villages, but it costs. They have spent //lakhs// of dollars---one dollar equal to eight rupees---and they have come here. Why? Through the mercy of Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. [break] [end]
