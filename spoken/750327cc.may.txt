====== Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā 1.3 ======

**Nitāi:**

"What the Upaniṣads describe as the impersonal Brahman is but the effulgence of His body, and the Lord known as the Supersoul is but His localized plenary portion. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa Himself, full with six opulences. He is the Absolute Truth, and no other truth is greater than or equal to Him."

**Prabhupāda:**

> yad advaitaṁ brahmopaniṣadi tad apy asya tanu-bhā
> ya ātmāntaryāmī puruṣa iti so asya aṁśa-vibhavaḥ
> ṣaḍ-aiśvaryaiḥ pūrṇaḥ ya bhagavān iha sa svayam ayaṁ
> na caitanyāt kṛṣṇāj jagati para-tattvaṁ param iha
> [[books:cc:adi:1:3|[Cc. Ādi 1.3]]]

Now the author, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, is establishing with great stress that //na caitanyāt kṛṣṇāt jagati para-tattvaṁ param iha:// "There is no greater truth than Kṛṣṇa Caitanya." We are after truth, so here the author of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// he is asserting that "Here is the Supreme Truth, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu." //Na caitanyāt kṛṣṇāt. Kṛṣṇāt,// because Kṛṣṇa has appeared as Kṛṣṇa Caitanya.

We have explained this truth yesterday, according to Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya's declaration, //vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogaṁ-śikṣārtham ekaḥ puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. //Puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ. Puruṣaḥ purāṇaḥ// is Kṛṣṇa. //Puruṣaḥ.// He is //puruṣaḥ,// and //purāṇaḥ, ādyam,// the original person. //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// In many Vedic literature Kṛṣṇa is described as the //purāṇaḥ puruṣaḥ,// the oldest. //Purāṇaḥ puruṣaḥ nava-yauvanaṁ ca// [Bs. 5.33]. Although He is the oldest of all, still, He is always like fresh youth, //nava-yauvanaṁ ca.// So how it is possible? They are trying to understand God. Sometimes they paint the picture of God as very old man. Because He is the original person, so by this time He must have become very old. This is imagination. This is not actually the form of the Lord.

The form of the Lord is there in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// and other Vedic literature. Even Śaṅkarācārya, who is a impersonalist, he has accepted Lord Kṛṣṇa as the supreme Nārāyaṇa. In his comment on //Bhagavad-gītā// he says, //nārāyaṇaḥ paraḥ avyaktāt:// "Nārāyaṇa is beyond this material creation." And while describing Nārāyaṇa, he has affirmed, //sa bhagavān svayaṁ kṛṣṇaḥ:// "That Nārāyaṇa is Kṛṣṇa." And he has clearly mentioned, "Now He has appeared as the son of Devakī and Vāsudeva," to confirm just like identification is confirmed when the father's name is there.

So Kṛṣṇa is //para-tattva,// accepted by all //ācāryas.// We are not talking of the fools and rascals who are theorizing without any knowledge. We are concerned with the authorities. So authorities... Especially in India, the whole Vedic system is being followed by the people under the authorities of the //ācārya. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.// One who is following the path of the //ācāryas,// he knows. //Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.// We cannot accept anyone as authority if he does not follow the //paramparā,// disciplic succession of //ācārya.// That is the Vedic system. //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]].

So Kṛṣṇa is //para-tattva. Na caitanyāt kṛṣṇāt jagati para-tattvaṁ param iha.// He is very emphatically asserting that "There is no more greater truth than Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa Caitanya." So according to the Vedic system, if you say something very emphatically, you must prove by Vedic evidences. Otherwise you can go on talking; nobody will hear. Sometimes people ask us about Kṛṣṇa and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that "What is the Vedic evidences?" So that Vedic evidences will be given, later chapters of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// He is not falsely asserting. Kavirāja Gosvāmī is very, very advanced devotee and scholar. He is not ordinary human being. He was empowered by Madana-mohana.

So nobody should try to write any Vedic literature... Vedic literature means the //śruti, smṛti, Purāṇa.// They are Vedic literature. Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has also confirmed,

> śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-
> pañcarātriki-vidhiṁ vinā
> aikāntikī harer bhaktiḥ
> utpātāyaiva kalpate
> [Brs. 1.2.101]

//Utpātā,// simply disturbance. //Yata mat tata patha:// "I can manufacture my own way." This rascaldom has been condemned by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. He says that //harer bhaktiḥ...// You will find many so-called //bhaktas// crying, falling down on the ground. But immediately after, he is smoking //bīḍī.// So why this is going on? Because they do not follow the injunction of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. Chanting, dancing very loudly, and after the performance is finished---I have seen it---"Can you give me a //bīḍī?//" You see? "My throat is now dried up."

So this is //utpātā.// Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī has described this kind of so-called devotional attitude is simply disturbance. They imitate. Imitate. Therefore Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has condemned. There are so many //apa-sampradāya// going on in the name of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's devotee. Who are they? //Āula, bāula, kartābhajā, neḍā, daraveśa, sāṅi, sahajiyā, sakhībhekī, smārta, jata-gosāñi.// Then //ativāḍī, cūḍādhārī, gaurāṅga-nāgarī, tota kahe ei tāra saṅga nāhi kori:// Tota Bābājī, he says, "I do not associate with these classes of men." So after disappearance of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, so many //apa-sampradāya// sprang up. So we should be very much careful that... //Sampradāya// means who are carefully following the Vedic principle. Therefore Kavirāja Gosvāmī, although asserting the truth, he is prepared to give Vedic evidences. Now he has begun.

The //Vedas,// they begin with the //Upaniṣad. Vedānta-sūtra, Upaniṣad,// they are all Vedic literature. //Purāṇas, Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata,// they are all Vedic literatures. Four //Vedas---Sāma, Yajur, Ṛg, Atharva//---then the //Upaniṣad,// then the //Vedānta-sūtra,// then //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Vedānta-sūtra// is the same thing. It is explanation. Therefore at the end of each chapter of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// it is stated by Vyāsadeva, //brahma-sūtrasya bhāṣya. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// means comment on the //Brahma-sūtra. Brahma-sūtra// is the gist code of all Vedic literature. And then it is explained, //athāto brahma jijñāsā.// That is explained in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā// [[books:sb:1:2:10|[SB 1.2.10]]]: "//Jīvasya,// for living being, the only business is to enquire about the Absolute Truth." That is the only business.

People are in trouble because they have given up their real business. Human life is meant for this business, //brahma-jijñāsā,// to enquire about the Absolute Truth. We have been given so many facilities by nature. There are so many living entities, they are standing on the ground for many years. The trees, the plants, and the aquatics, for many, many years they are in the water. The flies and insects, for many, many years they are in that condition. And gradually, by evolution, we come to this form of human life. Especially the Āryans, the advanced, civilized human being, he has got all the facilities. The uncivilized men live in the jungle, and they cannot utilize the resources.

[people making noise] [aside:] Ask them to stop. Somebody must remain there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Someone has to remain there.

**Prabhupāda:**
So therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, in very simple Bengali song, he says, //hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu.// This is our life. We have got this human form of life, but we are simply spoiling it. This is the whole situation. In our this movement we are traveling all over the world, and according to our views, how they are spoiling their very valuable human life in false identification that "I am this body," everyone, in big, big names: "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am German," "I am...," and they are spoiling their life under this bodily concept of life. According to //śāstra,// anyone who is identifying himself this body... That is the first instruction of the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa brought Arjuna to fight with the Kurus, and he identified himself as this body, and therefore he thought, "Killing of my cousin-brothers, it will not be good because I have got bodily relation."

So to dissipate this conception of life---that is the beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā//---Kṛṣṇa chastised him, Arjuna, //aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase// [[books:bg:2:11|[Bg. 2.11]]]. We are talking very, very big, big talks and plans, but actually we are nothing better than cats and dogs. This is our position, because we are identifying with this body. "My country," "my community," "my society," "my family," "my..." //Ahaṁ mameti. Jīvasya moho ayam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. They do not know. This is the ignorance, basic ignorance. "I" and "my." "I am this body, and anything in relationship with the body is mine." This is ignorance. But this ignorance is going on all over the world. That's a fact, this ignorance.

Therefore in the beginning the author said,

> vande śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nityānanda sahoditau
> gauḍodaye puṣpavantau
> citrau śandau tamo-nudau
> [[books:cc:adi:1:2|[Cc. Ādi 1.2]]]

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu, both of Them have come to deliver these fallen souls of this material world who are in the darkness of conception. So They are fighting all over the world this darkness. Just now somebody told me that the king of the Arabia...

**Devotee:**
Saudi Arabia.

**Prabhupāda:**
...is killed. He is killed now by his nephew or somebody else. This is going on. Even in family affairs it is going on. Why? This darkness, //ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. //Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti.// So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu along with His associates, Nityānanda Prabhu, Advaita Prabhu, Gadādhara Prabhu and //śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda,// they are trying to dissipate the darkness of this false identification. Kṛṣṇa simply instructed Arjuna about his darkness of identity, and He punished him, //aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase// [[books:bg:2:11|[Bg. 2.11]]]: "You are talking very big, big words, but you are lamenting on a subject matter on which no learned person laments." //Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.// That means "You are fool number one." //Paṇḍitāḥ.// "No //paṇḍita// makes like that. Now try to understand what is the position."

Then He said,

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
> tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ
> dhīras tatra na muhyati
> [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]

"First of all try to understand what you are." That is the beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is no politics. It is knowledge, pure knowledge. //Bhagavad-gītā// is pure knowledge. The politicians take advantage of it. The sociologists, the so-called //svāmīs, yogīs,// they take advantage of it and try to prove their all nonsensical theories. But it is not at all //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā// as it is is pure knowledge, beginning with the first knowledge one has to understand, that he is not this body. Because this is the basic principle of all ignorance: "I am this body." "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am this," "I am that"---this is the basic principle. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also says the same thing in a different way. He says, "I am not a //brāhmaṇa,// I am not a //kṣatriya,// I am not a //vaiśya,// I am not a //śūdra,// I am not a //brahmacārī,// I am not a //gṛhastha,// I am not a //vānaprastha,// I am not a //sannyāsī.//" These are negation. Then what is the positive? He says, //gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]: "I am the servant of the servant of the servant of the //gopī-bhartuḥ,// Kṛṣṇa, who maintains the //gopīs.//"

So this is our identification. But we have forgotten our identification.

> kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare
> pāśate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

We have forgotten our real relationship with Kṛṣṇa, and we are trying to be happy by material adjustment. This is modern civilization. One is thinking, "If I get such nice house, nice motorcar, nice business, nice bank balance, nice wife, nice children..." This is material civilization. But they do not know. Despite all these nice things, he will never be happy. Now you Europeans and Americans, you have got a good qualification. I described many times that you are no more very much interested with all these "nice" things, so-called nice things. Real nice thing is spiritual understanding. That nice things begins, //ahaṁ brahmāsmi:// "I am not this body." That is the beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa is instructing Arjuna that "You are not this body. You are spirit soul. Try to understand."

So we should learn from Kṛṣṇa. We should learn from Caitanya Mahāprabhu, who is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Therefore the author says that "You accept this authority." //Na caitanyāt kṛṣṇāt para-tattvaṁ param iha.// If you want knowledge, then... You have missed already, because when Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu appeared five hundred years ago people already became fools and rascals. They did not care for the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā.// Therefore He again came as devotee of Kṛṣṇa to teach us how to serve Kṛṣṇa, how to love Kṛṣṇa. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's cult, the same thing. When Kṛṣṇa appeared He said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "Give up everything, so-called rascaldom. Just surrender to Me." And Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He said the same thing as a devotee: //yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. He did not say anything new.

That is the authenticity. "I have manufactured some way"---these are all rascaldom. The same thing you should... You can... Just like in your country it is said, "Old wine in a new bottle." Similarly, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching the same thing. Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says the same thing: //yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. And we are saying the same thing, //na kṛṣṇāt caitanyāt para-tattvam:// "There is no more superior truth than Kṛṣṇa Caitanya." Why? Because He is talking the same truth as Kṛṣṇa said. This is called //paramparā// system. What Kṛṣṇa said, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said the same thing, and we are talking the same thing.

So there is no difficulty to understand the Absolute Truth. It may be presented in a different way... Not different way; it is directly. Kṛṣṇa says directly that "You surrender to Me," and Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that "You preach this cult," //yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. The same thing. We are not going to teach anything which is not spoken by Kṛṣṇa and which is not supported by Kṛṣṇa Caitanyadeva. This is our principle. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Kṛṣṇa preached Kṛṣṇa Himself, Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached the same principle, //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]], and we are preaching the same thing. We do not preach anything else. We do not manufacture anything. That is not our business.

So by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, by the mercy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, you all European boys and girls joined this movement under my, I mean to say, soliciting. I went to your country with this word only. I did not show you any magic, neither I have any knowledge how to play magic. That is not possible. I simply repeat the same thing, that "Here is Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here is Kṛṣṇa Caitanyadeva, the devotional form of Kṛṣṇa. You accept Them. Your life will be successful."

Thank you very much.
