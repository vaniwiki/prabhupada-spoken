"I offer my full obeisances unto the feet of Śrī Nityānanda Rāma, whose partial representation called Kāraṇodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, lying on the Kāraṇa Ocean, is the original puruṣa, the master of the illusory energy and the shelter of all the universes."

**Prabhupāda:**

Yesterday we discussed about //pūrṇāiśvarya, saṅkarṣaṇākhyam, nityānanda-rāmam,// the Deity, the superintending Deity of the spiritual world. Here also, anywhere, the master is Kṛṣṇa in His different form. So just like for management we expand some secretaries, or personal representative, similarly there is good management also in Kṛṣṇa's affairs. The original person is Kṛṣṇa, and His expansions, they are also as good as Kṛṣṇa, but departmental.

So we have discussed yesterday that in the spiritual world, Saṅkarṣaṇa is the supreme manager. And so far the material world is concerned, the same person is the Supreme, but His name is different, Kāraṇābdhiśāyī. In the spiritual world, the name is Saṅkarṣaṇa, and the material world, the supreme superintendent is also the same person, but name is different---Kāraṇābdhiśāyī. This Kāraṇābdhiśāyī is //māyā-bhartā. Bhartā// means husband. Just like a husband begets children in the womb of the wife, similarly, all these universes are impregnated in the total material energy, //māyā,// by Kāraṇābdhiśāyī Viṣṇu.

That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā: ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā.//

> sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya
> sambhavanti mūrtayo yāḥ
> tāsāṁ mahad-yonir brahma
> ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā
> [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]

The //bīja-pradaḥ pitā,// the father, is the seed-giving person, and the mother is receiving the seed, and then she is impregnated and they develops the body. As we have got experience, the creation, the creative energy, this is going on, the same process, everywhere. So this Kāraṇābdhiśāyī Viṣṇu---we have already discussed to some extent---is the origin of this material creation. That, the scientists says, that... I do not know exactly what is their theory, but so far I have heard, that... There are so many theories. One of them is, "There was a chunk, and from that, this material world..." They have no idea what is material world or spiritual world. But in that way a creation took place. Can anyone say what is the theory or..., of creation? Can any one of you say? What do they say about the creation?

**Trivikrama:**
Their one theory is that there's a big chunk, and then from that, everything else came.

**Jagadīśa:**
It exploded.

**Rūpānuga:**
An explosion, a big bang.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Rūpānuga:**
A big bang. An explosion.

**Haṁsadūta:**
There were some chemicals.

**Prabhupāda:**
So wherefrom the chunk came?

**Rūpānuga:**
They don't tell us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then that is not the... That is their brain fag, that they are simply trying to get everything from matter. That is their material brain. But we see here that the origin is not matter. Origin is Viṣṇu, Mahā-Viṣṇu. So Mahā-Viṣṇu is the supreme soul, //mahā,// Mahā-Viṣṇu. So we cannot accept such nonsense theory, that chunk exploded. Where is the evidence that a chunk explodes automatically? How nonsense theory it is. We have got experience, there is explosion of big, big mountains when there is dynamite, and the dynamite is given by some person. So how explosion can take place without the hand of somebody else, some living entity? This simple theory they cannot understand, that where is the evidence that matter acts automatically? Where is the evidence? How you can say that there was a chunk? Suppose there was a chunk. First of all, the question will be: "Who made this chunk?" And then again, next question will be: "How explosion took place unless there was some living being to explode, as we have got experience that sometimes we explode, explode the mountain with dynamite, and that is arranged by a living being?" So they have no common sense even, and they are passing as big, big philosopher, scientist. Then where is the evidence? Can anyone say? Is there any evidence that matter explodes without a living being's touch? Is there any? No.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
The sun. There are so many explosions are going on in the sun every day.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the same thing that, that //vṛścika-taṇḍula-nyāya.// Explosion is going on, but behind that all these explosion, all these transformations, is the Supreme Lord. That is here. And it is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ
> sūyate sa-carācaram
> hetunānena kaunteya
> jagad viparivartate
> [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]

They do not see who is behind this explosion. That is their ignorance, or poor fund of knowledge. We have got practical experience that no explosion takes place without the touch of a human being. Similarly, even there was explosion going on, but there is a touch of the Supreme Being. That is the statement in the //Bhagavad... Mayādhyakṣeṇa// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. We are seeing the explosion. Just like child sees the explosion. He does not know that there, behind the explosion, there is a management of a superior being. This is childish observation. Because in //śāstra// we see that behind everything the hand of the Supreme Being is there, and by our practical experience also, we see that matter does not act automatically without being touched by a living being. So how we can accept this argument that the explosion is going on automatically? What is the evidence? There is no evidence.

So this is not... Besides that, we have to accept the Vedic injunction, śāstric injunction, not nonsensical theories. If we are guided by nonsensical theories, then we'll never be able to understand how things are going on.

> panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo
> vāyor athāpi manaso muni-puṅgavānām
> so 'py asti yat-prapada-sīmny avicintya-tattve
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.34]

You can go on observing, one after another, by many, many years; many, many years. Just like if you start your jet plane from here to see where is the original cause, //panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara,// and go on for many, many millions of years with the speed of mind, //panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampra... Koṭi-śata-vatsara.// Millions and millions of years. And //panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo vāyor athāpi.// These airplane, //vāyu-ratha... Vāyu-ratha// means airplane. There is airplanes. There are different speeds. What is the speed? The speed is mental speed. Now their speed, say, eighteen thousand miles per hour. But if there is question of mental speed, it is more speedier than the //vāyu// speed. We have got experience. Many thousand miles, by your mind, you can reach within a second. So with the mental speed airplane, if you start today and go for many millions of years, still it will be not possible to find out wherefrom the explosion is coming. That's it.

So that is not the way. Therefore //śruti-pramāṇam. Śruti-pramāṇam// means from the Vedic evidence we have to understand. Now, just like in the //Vedas// it is said, //jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi// [Padma Purāṇa]. In the //Vedas,// all knowledge was there, all the living entities described fully and with minute, exact quantity. Now, within the water, we understand from the Vedic literature there are 900,000 forms of aquatics. Now, the modern scientists, how many they have observed or studied? But it is said exactly, 900,000's. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati.// Of course, you cannot enter within the water. But on the land, now different species of plants and trees, and that is two million. How many the botanists have studied? Two million. //Sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati.// Even in your country, in your village, you'll find daily some new vegetable. You see? So these are the Vedic calculation. And not only that, there are different species of life, and how they are working, what senses are predominant in each and every life and everything is described. Everything is very minutely described. Therefore, if we want to have knowledge, you cannot do it by mental speculation. We should know that our mind is very, very limited. Simply by theorizing, it is not possible. Therefore //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet sampit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham// [MU 1.2.12]. So we have to know from the supreme authority or the //Vedas.// Then the knowledge will be perfect. Otherwise...

So original creative energy is coming from this Kāraṇābdhiśāyī Viṣṇu. This is confirmed in //Brahma-saṁhitā. Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// [Bs. 5.48]. The //jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ...// Here it is also said, //ajāṇḍa. Jagad-aṇḍa// or //ajāṇḍa,// the same thing, or //brahmāṇḍa,// the same meaning. //Aja// means Brahmā. So the Brahmā is the head of this //aṇḍa.// It is egglike. This whole universe is like an egg, //aṇḍa.// So as from the //aṇḍa,// from the egg, a bird is coming out, similarly, from this egglike substance, Aja has come. //Aja// means who does not take birth like other, human being or animals, but from this //aṇḍa.// So the Kāraṇābdhiśāyī Viṣṇu another name is //ajāṇḍa aṅghāśrayanda.// His whole body is producing universes. //Ajāṇḍa-saṅghāśraya. Saṅghāśraya// means aggregate, congregation. Just like we have got holes on the body, pores in the body. So we do not know even how many pores are there in my body, but it is a fact. We cannot, even in a localized head, we cannot count how many pores are there from which the hairs are coming. Is it possible to count? And how many pores are there in our body? This is a little body. And just imagine Mahā-Viṣṇu.

Therefore His name is Mahā-Viṣṇu. From His pores of the body, the universes are coming. From His nostril, with the breathing, universes are coming. So just imagine how many universes are there. The whole body is full of potency to produce universes. And it is continually being produced. Brahmā, //brahmā bṛhatvād, bṛhannatvāt.// This is the creation. And how you can accept this theory that there was a chunk and explosion and the universes became manifested? And these things are being accepted. //Mūḍha nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.// These rascals, //mūḍhas,// they do not know, and misleading... //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. These rascals are blind, and they are leading some other blind men, and they are satisfied that "We have got all scientific knowledge." That's all. That is not the way of scientific knowledge. If you want scientific knowledge, then you should know from Kṛṣṇa. That is scientific knowledge. //Jñānaṁ me paramaṁ guhyaṁ yad vijñāna-samanvitam. Vijñāna-samanvitam.//

So we do not, I mean to say, become proud to have very, very scientific, accurate knowledge by speculation. We are not such people. We are taught by the //paramparā// system that we are humble servants of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and what our master says, we accept it. That's all. We do not like to be foolishly proud to have full knowledge of this universe, of this creation. We have full knowledge, but we understand in this way. This is called //paramparā// system. Just like in the //Vedas...// Take for example the //Brahma-saṁhitā.// It is spoken by Lord Brahma. Brahmā has got the full knowledge. //Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Because the full knowledge was given..., full knowledge of creation was given to Brahmā. We do not accept this nonsense theory that there was no human being, and later on, they became gradually civilized, and for the last two hundred years only they have got the intelligence, scientific knowledge. We do not accept these nonsense theories.

We... Our understanding is: the first creation is the most intelligent human being, Brahmā, not that there was no human being or any living being. No. The first creation is the most perfect or intelligent living being. This is our theory. Not theory; it is the Vedic evidence. And he got full knowledge from the Supreme, //tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye, ādi-kavi,// the original learned person, and then he compiled //Vedas,// giving full knowledge what he experienced. And the //Brahma-saṁhitā// is there---it is written by Brahmā. And in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,// the Kāraṇābdhiśāyī Viṣṇu is mentioned, //yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā// [Bs. 5.48]. It is not that we are accepting this verse of //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// author. No. It is confirmed by the Vedic knowledge. This is the origin of creation, not that this chunk, or... No. Matter cannot expand. Matter, when there is reaction... Just like explosion. We have got experience that there is sometimes explosion, like if you mix together two chemicals, acid and alkaline, there is explosion for the time being. But this explosion takes place when a chemist in the laboratory mixes soda, soda bicarb, and citric acid. Otherwise, it is not possible.

So this is wrong theory that matter automatically takes the explosion or something like that. Matter is handled by some superior living being. Then it explodes or whatever you call. It reacts. Otherwise, it is not possible. And because the living being takes the superior position for explosion of matter or reaction of matter, therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is admitted that the matter is handled by the living being; it is inferior energy. Both of them are energies of the Supreme Lord, but one is superior energy, another is inferior energy. That is the statement in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]], these material things---earth, water, air, fire---they are inferior energy. And Kṛṣṇa says, //apareyam:// "They are inferior. There is another, superior energy." //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā:// "There is another, superior energy." And what is that superior energy? Now, //jīva-bhūtā,// "These living entities." //Jīva-bhūtā mahā-bāho.// The superior energy is not produced by the inferior energy. That is nonsense. The inferior energy is produced by the superior energy. This is perfect. We have got experience that the superior controls the inferior, not that inferior controls the superior. Where you get all this idea? Therefore it has been described as //aparā// and //parā prakṛti.// And what is that //parā prakṛti? Jīva-bhutāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]. The whole world is being manipulated by this superior energy. Just like we have got experience that a human being, an engineer, he is creating a skyscraper building, not that a skyscraper building is creating an engineer. Where is this theory?

So these are all nonsense, simply nonsense, //mūḍha.// Of course, we use this word //mūḍha,// and people become very angry, but what can I..., can we do? [laughter] The //mūḍhas// must be explained as //mūḍhas.// And because the //mūḍhas// are going as intelligent, therefore there is chaotic condition. [lizard making sound] There it is confirmed. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to become intelligent, not to remain //mūḍhas,// and to expose these rascal //mūḍhas.// That's this, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So you must be prepared. While making propaganda, expose these //mūḍhas.// That is one of the service of Kṛṣṇa. Don't remain foolish. Wherever there is required, fight with these //mūḍhas// and tell them rightly, straightforward, that "You are //mūḍhas.//"

Thank you very much.
