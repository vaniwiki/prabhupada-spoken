"I offer my respectful obeisances unto the feet of Śrī Nityānanda Rāma, whose secondary part is the Viṣṇu lying in the ocean of milk. That Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of all living entities and the maintainer of all the universes. Śeṣa Nāga is His further subpart."

**Prabhupāda:**

> yasyāṁśāṁśāṁśaḥ parātmākhilānāṁ
> poṣṭā viṣṇur bhāti dugdhābdhi-śāyī
> kṣauṇī-bhartā yat-kalā so 'py anantas
> taṁ śrī-nityānanda-rāmaṁ prapadye
> [[books:cc:adi:1:11|[Cc. Ādi 1.11]]]

So all these Viṣṇu description beginning from Kāraṇodakaśāyī, Mahā-Viṣṇu, who is producing universes... Then next Viṣṇu is Garbhodakaśāyī, means the same Mahā-Viṣṇu entering in each and every universe. Then again, the same Viṣṇu, for maintenance of this material world, is lying on the //kṣīrabdhi,// ocean of milk. And the same Viṣṇu, Kṣīrabdhiśāyī Viṣṇu, is maintaining not only these universal affair, but also He is entering in each and every living being's heart, even within the atom. This is the expansion of //viṣṇu-tattva, viṣṇu-tattva// within this material world. So just imagine. For creating and maintaining, sustaining, the whole material world is a network of Viṣṇu's activities, and some rascal says, "There was chunk, and there was creation." This creation is so easy? And maintain them, whole the creation? If you create some center of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, how much strain you have to exert to maintain the standard, status quo. Similarly, there are so many universes created, maintained. And there is another phase, annihilation.

That is the process of material creation. We have got experience. Anything material is created is... The beginning, there is a date, and it is maintained for sometimes, then it is annihilated. Anything you take---this body, your body, my body---it is created a certain date, and it is maintained for a certain number of years, and again it is annihilated. This is material world. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]: "It manifests sometimes and again disappears." This is called material world, and because it is never eternally sustained, therefore it is called //māyā.// It is not false, as the Māyāvādī philosophers says, "It is false." It is not false. Lord Viṣṇu is taking so much care to create this material world. How you can say it is false? It is not false? It is fact, but it is temporary. This is the difference between the material world and the spiritual world. In the spiritual world there is no creation and no destruction. In the material world, there is creation and destruction.

Now we, being part and parcel of Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa says personally, //mamaivāṁśaḥ.// So if Kṛṣṇa is not affected by this creation and annihilation, then we, being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, why we should be affected by this creation and annihilation? We are very much afraid of being annihilated, and we are trying to discover many scientific, so-called scientific methods how we may not be destroyed. Why this inclination that we may not be destroyed? Because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, therefore eternity of life is our aspiration. That is the proof that we are..., as Kṛṣṇa is eternal, similarly, we are also eternal, but circumstantially we are now put into this material world. Therefore our main business is how to revive our original position not to be annihilated, never annihilated. It is clearly said in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Actually we are not annihilated. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]], //nityo śāśvato 'yam.//

So that is our real business. This requires little intelligence, that "We are eternal. Why we are put into this process of taking birth and death?" Kṛṣṇa also says, "This is the real misery of life," //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. They are trying, the so-called scientists, trying to increase... If the scientists sees that a man was to die immediately; now he has lived one hour more---he thinks that his science is successful. That is their foolishness. If you live one or two hour more or one year or two year more... In Allahabad we had a friend. He was very rich man. So he was on the dying stage. So many big, big doctors were attending, and he was begging to the doctors, "Doctor, can you not give me at least four years' time? I could finish what I have already attempted." So here we know the death is certain. Still, we make some scheme, big or small, according to idea. But we do not know that at any moment, death will come. "As sure as death." And this death is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś ca aham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]. That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Repeatedly we are taking birth and making big, big scheme, and we may be successful, but at any moment Kṛṣṇa says, "Now you get out, and your all business finished. And whatever you have done, that is also finished, or I'll take it away," just to teach us that this place, material world, is not our place. That is our misconception, or //māyā,// that we want to make a permanent settlement in this material world, which is not possible at all.

This knowledge they do not know. The scientists are thinking of making life eternal, immortal, like the Hiraṇyakaśipu's scheme, that he wanted to be immortal by //tapasya.// This is also //tapasya,// the so many scientific endeavor. This is also //tapasya.// But this //tapasya// is useless. It has no effect. They are trying foolishly to become immortal. That requires //tapasya.// Many, many demons... The demons do like that, //tapasya// for living ever. But they will not take the real method of //tapasya,// to purify. Their real aim is this material world, and here they want to become immortal. That is their foolishness. Here, nobody can become immortal. Even Brahmā, who is the creator of this universe, he's also not immortal. But they are trying to be immortal here. That is not possible. //Tapasya// should be... To become immortal, //tapasya// is recommended. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattva// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Tapasya// should be made. Immortality is your right. Because you are part and parcel of God, you are immortal. Now you are diseased. You are accepting birth and death. This is diseased condition. So try to cure the disease. Don't try to become immortal in diseased condition. That is not possible. You must cure the disease. If you simply imagine to live eternally, that is not possible. [aside:] Stop these children doing that. Immortal is our goal of life, immortality. That is the goal of life. But they are not taking seriously how to become immortal. That is their ignorance.

So this how to become immortal, there is process recommended in the //śāstras.// That is in India. That is nowhere else. If you actually serious about becoming immortal, then you should study the Vedic literatures from India. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, that in India there is the process, how to become immortal. So He recommended, therefore, He desired, that Indians, you Indians, you have got the facility. Don't spoil your life by imitating the so-called rascal scientists of the Western countries, but you take advantage of the science, spiritual science, which is in India, and distribute the knowledge, because they are in ignorance. Therefore He says,

> bhārata bhūmite manuṣya janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' karo paropakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This should be the India's business. This whole world is in darkness, demonic civilization. And India, there is the remedy. So if the Indians take advantage and make his life perfect and then go to the Western countries and distribute this immortal knowledge, that is real business of India. Unfortunately, they are trying to imitate. There is no thing, nothing to imitate. And if you say that they have discovered so many material comforts, that is all right. But with all your material comforts, you cannot become immortal. That is certain. That is certain. But you are desiring how to become immortal. That science is in India. That is //tapasya. Tapasya// means //brahmacaryena. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa yamena niyamena vā tyāgena śrota-śaucābhyām...// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. This, this is the //śāstra.//

So if you want to learn that science, how to become immortal, then you have to undergo austerities. That austerities begins with //brahmācārya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa. Brahmacarya// means controlling sex life. That is required. If you can control sex impulse... Because that is the medium of bondage. Here in this material world everyone is working hard to enjoy sex life. That is the main aim. Main aim is... And that you will find, in your country especially, very, very prominent. In Paris very, very old men, they are going to the club at night simply for the same purpose. So this has to be controlled. Controlled means mind and the senses. And the prominent sense is sex. That is called control.

So if you want to become immortal, then you must practice this. Of course, in Western countries, it is very difficult. They say, "It is impossible." Big, big men, they say, "It is impossible." Yes, it is impossible. Therefore //śāstra// has given concession that you require sex life, but enjoy it in married life, but no illicit sex. At least, stop this. If you want to be immortal, these things are to be followed: no illicit sex, no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling. Then you can think of immortality, gradually. That is called //tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa.// Every //śāstra,// you'll find. At least at the end of life one should be completely free from these bad habits. That is called //sannyāsa.// Don't cheat, accept //sannyāsa// and indulge in these things. Don't be cheater. That is very bad. //Sannyāsa// means to take vow. In other station of life, there may be we fall down. But //sannyāsa// means no, no falldown. Therefore we have now taken very seriously. Unless one is found completely competent to accept //sannyāsa,// there is no more use of awarding //sannyāsa.// So this is the process. //Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. //Brahmacarya// is very, very essential. And that is, when one becomes detestful to sex life, that is the beginning of spiritual life. That is the beginning of spiritual life.

So immortality is not very difficult thing. Simply one has to adopt the method, process, as recommended in the //śāstra,// and then you can become immortal. Kṛṣṇa says, //janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ, tyaktā dehaṁ punar janma naiti...// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. //Punar janma naiti//---this is immortality. The Kṛṣṇa says, //punar janma na:// "No more //punar janma.//" And if you have no //punar janma,// there is no //punar// death, //punar vyadhaka,// or //punar// disease. //Punar// means "again." So if you can stop your //punar janma//---no more taking birth---that is perfection of life. Therefore it is recommended that the guardians, namely the //guru,// spiritual master, the father, the mother, the king, or the government... The whole system should be so centralized that people may be saved from this process of //punar janma.// That is real government, real parenthood, real //guru-//ism---how to save the disciples or the citizens or the son, subordinate. They come to your shelter. Just like these children have come to the shelter of father and mother, the disciples have come to the shelter of //guru,// the citizens are expecting good government. So they are subordinate, expecting protection from the superior. Therefore the whole scheme should be how to protect them from repetition of death. //Na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum// [[books:sb:5:5:18|[SB 5.5.18]]]. We are entangled by this process of birth, death, old age and disease, and it is the duty of the //guru,// duty of the father, duty of the mother, duty of the government how to save them from this process of birth, death, old and di... That is civilization. Otherwise it is dog civilization. What is the meaning? This is civilization.

So whole Vedic system is designed in such a way that ultimately one is saved from this process of birth, death, old age and disease. Long, long ago, when Viśvāmitra Muni came to Mahārāja Daśaratha for begging Rāma-Lakṣmaṇa to take them to the forest because one demon was disturbing... They could kill, but the killing business is for the //kṣatriyas.// This is Vedic civilization. It is not the business of the //brāhmaṇa.// So the first reception Viśvāmitra Muni got from Mahārāja Daśaratha, that //aihiṣṭhaṁ yat punar-janma-jayāya:// "You are... You great sages, saintly persons, you have given up the society. You are living alone in the forest. What is the purpose? The purpose is //punar-janma-jayāya,// to conquer over repetition of birth." This is the purpose. Similarly, our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is also meant for the same purpose, //punar-janma-jayāya,// for conquering over repetition of birth and death. You should always remember this. A little mistake will spoil the whole scheme, little mistake. Nature is very strong. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. Very, very strong.

So you all, boys and girls, those who have come from America, I am very much thankful to you. But don't be less serious. Be very serious. And another thing I'll request especially to the Americans, that America has got good potentiality to save the world, so if you preach very nicely in your country... And not all of them will be interested, but if a section of men in your country, you can turn them to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, it will be great benefit to the whole world. But the aim is the same, //punar-janma-jayāya:// to gain victory over this process of birth, death and old age. This is not fiction; this is fact. People are not serious. But you can teach your people; otherwise, the whole human society is at risk. They are like animals, without any... Especially this Communist movement is very, very dangerous---to make a big animals. They are already animals, and this movement is making big animals.

So I am speaking to America because America is a little serious against this communistic movement. And it can be counteracted because the process is current since a very, very long time: //deva asura, devāsura,// the fight between the demigods and the demons. So the same fight is there in different name: Communists and the capitalists. But the capitalists are also eighty percent, ninety percent demons. Yes. Because they do not know the science of God. That is demonic principle. So there is good chance in your country to make them..., or they rectify their demonic principles. And then they will be very, mean, strongly able to fight with the other demons. Because if we become //deva... Deva// means Vaiṣṇava. //Viṣṇu-bhakto bhaved deva āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ.// Those who are devotees of Lord Viṣṇu, they are called //deva,// or demigods. And those who are just the opposite number... The opposite number, also, they have got some god. Just like the demons, they worship especially Lord Śiva. Or Rāvaṇa, the example... We are not accusing unnecessarily. Rāvaṇa was a great demon, but he was devotee. Worshiping Lord Śiva means to gain some material profit. And in the worshiping Viṣṇu there is material profit. That is given by Viṣṇu. That is not //karma.// But Vaiṣṇava, they are not aspiring after any material profit. The material profit automatically comes. But they, they do not desire. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. Material profit is not their aim of life. Their aim of life---how to satisfy Viṣṇu, Lord Viṣṇu. That is Vaiṣṇava. //Viṣṇur asya devataḥ. Na te...// And the demons, they do not know that to become Vaiṣṇava, that is the highest perfection of life. They do not know it.

So anyway, our request is that you all young men who have taken to this path of Vaiṣṇavism, and there is very good chance to preach this cult in your country, so even if you are not very much successful in other countries, in your country you'll be very much successful. There is good potency. And try to make them stronger to fight with the demonic principles.

Thank you very much.
