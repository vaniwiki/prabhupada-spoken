====== Morning Walk [World War III] ======

**Rūpānuga:**
[indistinct] Intoxication.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? These are all.

**Rūpānuga:**
Technology.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rūpānuga:**
So many gadgets to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Anthropomorphis... What is called? Anthropology.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
University of //Avidyā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [chuckles] Right you are. //Avidyāra bhore. Kota nidrā jāo māyā avidyāra bhore.//

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Psychiatrists.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. All Western adventure to keep people in darkness. And that is going on. Now it will be smashed by the next war. Next war will come very soon.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh!

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Next war...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Your country, America, is very much eager to kill these Communists. And the Communists are also very eager. So very soon there will be war. And perhaps India will be the greatest sufferer.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Greatest...?

**Devotees:**
Sufferer.

**Brahmānanda:**
Sufferer.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because America is aiming to start the war from India.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh!

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because India and Russia, they are...

**Brahmānanda:**
They are... Friendship.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Side by side. If the war is started from India...

**Rūpānuga:**
So India will become...

**Prabhupāda:**
And the Russians are ready here already, I have heard, with soldiers and... Not soldiers. I mean to say...

**Haṁsadūta:**
Missiles.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They are also vigilant.

**Viṣṇujana:**
Will that help our preaching, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Preaching will be very nice after the war when both of them, especially Russia, will be finished.

**Rūpānuga:**
They want to make India the battleground?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Also, Prabhupāda, Ātreya Ṛṣi said that the Arabs are preparing for the war. They're buying billions and billions of dollars' worth of missiles and jets and tanks from America.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, so they are being prepared. War will soon start.

**Viṣṇujana:**
The Arab men all go to America to be trained in the armed forces there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Viṣṇujana:**
In all the armed forces centers in America, they train the Arab nations to fight.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Viṣṇujana:**
They let the young men come into the USA to learn how to use the missiles and everything.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Recently, this Bhutto of Pakistan, he was very happy because they were talking about lifting a ten-year holding on arms from the United States, and now, they say, Pakistan will soon get arms from America.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they are getting. They are already getting. The Pakistan will start the war with India. And then everything will be...

**Devotees:**
Oh! Whew!

**Devotee:**
Pakistan will start a war... [devotees talking among themselves]

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Again. They have started the war maybe eight times.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Hmm? No, we can go.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
What will the devotees do while the war is going on?

**Prabhupāda:**
Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got only business.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
We will stay in the cities or will...?

**Prabhupāda:**
We can stay anywhere. We have got our Māyāpur, Vṛndāvana. But the danger is the government will say that "All Americans go away." That is the danger. I am thinking of that position. What shall I do at that time?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Take Indian citizenship?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Indian citizenship?

**Prabhupāda:**
If you take, it is very nice. Then they will ask you to go to war. [laughter]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Will this war spread to many different countries and continents?

**Prabhupāda:**
The actual war will be between America and Russia.

**Rūpānuga:**
What about British devotees, British citizens? Would the British be asked to leave? British citizens? Commonwealth citizens?

**Prabhupāda:**
Britishers are now finished. They have no importance.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
He means if British devotees came to India, would they be asked to leave.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, I mean to say... I am speaking of politics. Devotees are the same... Oh, British citizens...? They may...

**Rūpānuga:**
You say the Americans might have to leave. What about the British?

**Prabhupāda:**
But they, generally, during wartime...

**Viṣṇujana:**
Everyone.

**Prabhupāda:**
...they ask all foreigners.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, I see.

**Jayapatāka:**
During the last war, the Christian Mission of Krishnanagar, they had many Italian priests also, but the government gave them permission to stay, although India was at war against..., with Italians.

**Prabhupāda:**
In the missionary consideration, they can do that.

**Jayādvaita:**
What will be the position with the Chinese if the Russians and Americans fight?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, I am not a politician. [laughter] China does not war..., not want war. They want to...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Develop.

**Prabhupāda:**
...construct.

**Rūpānuga:**
They're not ready.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They are not very much interested in war.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that this war will destroy the demonic civilization.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Does that mean that it'll destroy all the cities and all the industries?

**Prabhupāda:**
War means destruction of all cities. That is natural. You have got experience in Europe so many times.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Cities and industries.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Cities and industries.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is the main target.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Nobody's interested in a farm. [break]

**Jayādvaita:**
...endeavor, pure devotees are automatically expert in politics, economics, everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayādvaita:**
Without separate endeavor, a pure devotee is automatically expert in everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayādvaita:**
Politics, economics.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayādvaita:**
Sociology.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavanti// [//Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad// 1.3]. If you know Kṛṣṇa, then you understand everything. That is the Vedic injunction. //Yasmin vijñāte.// If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa... In //Bhagavad-gītā,// it is also said that "There will be no more anything to understand." In the Ninth Chapter? What is that verse? Can anyone say?

**Jayādvaita:**
The Fifteenth Chapter.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Avaśiṣyate. Jñātavyam avaśiṣyate.// You cannot...?

**Santoṣa:**
//Yaj jñātvā...//

**Prabhupāda:**
...cannot recite, the whole verse?

**Santoṣa:**
//Yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo 'nyaj.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the second line. First line?

**Santoṣa:**
//Sa evaṁ guhyatamaṁ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vakṣyāmy...// Yes, that is the verse. //Yaj jñātvā anyaj jñātavyam na avaśiṣyate// [[books:bg:7:2|[Bg. 7.2]]]. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is such a great science that if one becomes expert, then he knows everything.

**Haṁsadūta:**
So Prabhupāda, is there something we should do to prepare ourselves for this disaster?

**Prabhupāda:**
What?

**Haṁsadūta:**
This coming war.

**Prabhupāda:**
You should simply prepare for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Haṁsadūta:**
That's all?

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda, people sometimes argue that "God placed us in this world..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
People argue that God has placed us in this world, and that He's left us in darkness, so therefore He's played a trick on us. What is our argument against this?

**Prabhupāda:**
You have come to this world of darkness, and Kṛṣṇa is trying to raise you again to the light. That is the fact. You have willingly come to this nonsense place. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He comes Himself and tries to again get you out, deliver from this nonsense thing. This is real position.

**Tripurāri:**
They say that "God has put us here, but He's given us intelligence, so we're to figure it out ourselves."

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tripurāri:**
That "God has put us here, and He's given us intelligence, so we're to figure it out ourselves."

**Prabhupāda:**
So therefore you take intelligence from God, you rascal. Why do you keep yourself in darkness?

**Tripurāri:**
Well, they say that "God has given us the intelligence to figure it out on our own."

**Prabhupāda:**
That is intelligence---you surrender. You are surrendering to //māyā,// to your wife, to your dog, to your family, to your house, to your nation. Why not God? You rascal. You are surrendering to so many other things. Why not to God?

**Rūpānuga:**
Just like you told that Russian professor that he is surrendering to Lenin, but we are surrendering to Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rūpānuga:**
But everyone has to surrender.

**Prabhupāda:**
Surrender, this..., that is the only way. You cannot become independent. You have to surrender. Who is a man who has not surrendered? At least he finds out a dog and surrenders to him. [laughter] In your country there are so many people living with the dog. So surrender is the only business of you. //Jīvera 'svarūpa' haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. [pause] So Acyutānanda cannot come?

**Viṣṇujana:**
He's lecturing in the temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, someone asked a question the other day about the atom which I couldn't give the answer to. His question is that if we say that within the atom the living entity, the //jīva,// is present, and life symptoms means six symptoms of birth, growth...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Their life symptoms has not yet come. But there is.

**Jayādvaita:**
Potential.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
His question was... It was sort of a dual question. At what time, or what...? Just like at the time of disintegration of this body, the living entity leaves this body and the body disintegrates, so does the atomic body also disintegrate when the living entity leaves it and moves to a higher body?

**Prabhupāda:**
Atomic body? Atomic body means material body. Unless you are free from this material body, the atomic body will go on with you. That means unless you are //mukta,// the atomic body will go on. Mind, intelligence, ego---they are also atomic, finer atomic body.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But within each atom the living entity is present?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. God is present; therefore living entity is present.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So the living entity is present within the atom just as I am present within this body. When I leave this body, my body breaks apart.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you leave this body, enter another body.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right.

**Prabhupāda:**
By nature's law.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And when I leave this body, the body breaks apart.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When I leave this body, the body dis...

**Prabhupāda:**
The body is already atomic combination.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So it remains atomic combination. You leave the body.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. It remains...

**Prabhupāda:**
You leave the house. That does not mean the house is finished.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right, I can understand that.

**Haṁsadūta:**
He's asking that if the soul leaves the atomic particle, then does the particle break apart. Isn't it?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. You have not left atomic particle.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, but you, you're... I think you were saying that within the atom there's also a living entity. So when that living entity leaves the atomic particle, does the particle break apart? Or doesn't it? I mean what...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Just try to understand. From the //śāstra,// you understand that //aṇḍāntara-stham:// "God lives within the atom."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And when the God is there, living entity's also there. This... This much you try to understand. Because God and living entity, they remain together, as two friends. God is trying to save this fallen friend. That is the information from //Upaniṣad.// So when God is there, the living entity is also there.

**Rūpānuga:**
So Paramātmā and //jīvātmā// are always together.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Can we say that the living entity is present within the atom by consciousness?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? No. Consciousness will gradually develop according to the bodily situation.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
How does the //jīva// get out of the atom and take a gross body?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
How will that //jīva...//

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughing] Body is combination of atoms. How he gets out of the atom? Body is nothing but combination of many atoms. Everything material is combination of many atoms. That's all.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
The //jīvas// inside the atom, are they like impersonalists who are in the Brahman?

**Prabhupāda:**
That you consider. He has not developed his consciousness. Practically, it is like dead.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually, if there was a war, a large-scale war, I think that our farming projects...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think that the various farm projects that we have would be very good because, as you said, the cities would be bombed, but the farms would not be disturbed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The farm project... Even some hundreds of years, it was so nice. Even there was war, they would not attack the farmers. Rather, they would ask, "Where the other party has gone?" So they will say: "Oh, we have seen some soldiers going this way." That's all. They were not affected. That was the principle. Farmers were not attacked, just like at the present moment, the law is the civilians are not attacked. The military target is attacked. That is the law. But they do all nonsense. Even at the present moment civilians are not attacked. Just like Kurukṣetra Battle. It was taken far away from the civilian inhabitation.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Some field.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is civilization. "Why these innocent civilians should be killed? Let us fight, military to military. That's all." That is honest fighting. We have to settle some things by fighting. So fighting may be, I mean to say, limited within the fighters, not with the civilians.

**Rāmeśvara:**
In modern warfare it's...

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not? Yes. But they, they are so rascals, they throw bomb anywhere.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Especially atom bombs.

**Prabhupāda:**
But one thing is that because civilians are also responsible for declaring war, because the parliament is the representation of the people...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
//Karma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore, now the war is between people to people, nation to nation. They support with men and money. So therefore they are also killed by nature's law. [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
Prabhupāda, in the //Ādi-līlā// you wrote that the Communist movement is greater than the capitalist movement because there are more //śūdras// than //vaiśyas,// so that in a war between Communism and capitalism, the Communists would win.

**Prabhupāda:**
Naturally. They are in greater number.

**Rāmeśvara:**
But these modern wars are fought with missiles and bombs more than armies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Formerly, also, there were //brahmāstra,// fire, firearms, //brahmāstra.// [break] ...problems that we are facing, they were also in the past under different name, different forms. [break]

**Nalinī-kānta:**
...Communists win, that will not stop our preaching?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Nalinī-kānta:**
They do not like to hear of God.

**Rāmeśvara:**
You wrote that if the Communists are victorious, they would destroy whatever is left of the culture.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Victory for the Communists means the whole human culture is lost.

**Ajāta-śatru:**
Does it mean that they will also attack the Kṛṣṇa consciousness?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they have already begun. They are not passing our temple in Bombay.

**Nalinī-kānta:**
If after the war the preaching will be still good, that means the Communists will not be victorious.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Nalinī-kānta:**
The Americans will win?

**Prabhupāda:**
Honest people will take to religious way of life. The Communists becoming victorious means they are also ruined. [aside:] Who is that saintly person, sitting under the tree?

**Devotees:**
Tuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break] ...too much danger, you all come and sit down here, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya.// Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Jayādvaita:**
Then men will be eager to come join our India project.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can go to Africa also. [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, anywhere we can go, so many places, yes.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Hong Kong also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hong Kong? [laughter]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhavānanda Mahārāja can [indistinct].

**Ajāta-śatru:**
Means then some devotees has to stay in Europe or in America. So...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, everything you stay. We have got place like this.

**Rūpānuga:**
Our farms are very nice because economically when everything is in chaos, we can still provide food for our men.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Rūpānuga:**
And milk and butter.

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
Milk and butter.

**Santoṣa:**
In America, //prabhu.// [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
...that if there is a war between Russia and America, there would be a nuclear war, and they would pollute the whole atmosphere with radioactive particles, which would kill everyone.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is already polluted.

**Rāmeśvara:**
They say that this radioactive fallout...

**Prabhupāda:**
The whole material world is polluted. Who will live here? [laughter] A little, say, twenty years before, dying. After all, you have to die, twenty years after or twenty years before. So it is already polluted. That is humbugism. They will die at the end, but still they are trying to live. [//kīrtana// in background growing progressively louder as Prabhupāda approaches temple]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Like they're creating their own...

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the difference between man of knowledge and without knowledge. A man of knowledge will think, "After all, I have to die. So what is the difficulty, dying a few days more or before?" That is knowledge. And those who are not in knowledge, they are afraid of death. Best business is, before the death comes let us finish our Kṛṣṇa consciousness perfectly. That is wanted. Death will come. You cannot avoid it.

**Rāmeśvara:**
They say that this radioactive fallout will pollute the air, so that no crops can be grown.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. You shall die without food. Because after all, the death. In Bengal, it is called: //more bhera ghalne//[?]: "The most misfortunate thing is death." That will come. Therefore the best intelligence is how to avoid death.

**Rūpānuga:**
Become immortal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is real intelligence, not to be bothered by these trifle temporary things that "I am dying twenty years before. If the situation was better, I would have lived more twenty years." What is this mentality?

**Devotee:**
Back to Godhead.

**Ajāta-śatru:**
Yes, we can go back to Godhead.

[Prabhupāda enters temple; loud //kīrtana//] [end]
