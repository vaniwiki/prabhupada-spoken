====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...any language, you should submit, and you should feel that, that "I am worthless. My Guru Mahārāja has given this chance to serve Kṛṣṇa, to offer Kṛṣṇa... My Lord, I am worthless. I have no capacity to serve You. But on the order of my Guru Mahārāja, I am trying to serve You. Please do not take any offense. Accept whatever I can do. That's all. That is my request." That //mantra// is sufficient. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. Kṛṣṇa never said that "One who offers Me with Sanskrit //mantra.//" //Yo me bhaktyā prayacchati.// Real thing is //bhakti,// feeling: "How to serve Kṛṣṇa? How to please Him?" That is wanted. Not to see that you are a very good scholar in speaking in Sanskrit or English or... That is not... Always feel that "I am worthless, but I have been, by the grace of my Guru Mahārāja, I have been given the chance. So kindly accept whatever little service I can give. I am offensive. So kindly excuse me." In this way be humble, meek, and offer your feeling, and Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied. Not that you have to show how you can speak in Sanskrit language.

**Indian man (1):**
In another //śloka, tṛṇād api sunīcena taror...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man (1):**
//...api sahiṣṇūna amāninā mānadena kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] So you, for the time being, engage. See that the Hindi publication is done very nice.

**Indian man (2):**
What I thought was... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī// [[books:bg:6:1|[Bg. 6.1]]]. //Anāśritaḥ kar...// Everyone is expecting some good result for his sense gratification. That is //āśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ.// He has taken the shelter of good result. But one who does not take shelter of the result of activities... It is my duty. //Karyam. Karyam// means "It is my duty. Doesn't matter what is the result. I must do it sincerely to my best capacity. Then I don't care for the result. Result is in Kṛṣṇa's hand." //Karyam:// "It is my duty. My Guru Mahārāja said it, so it is my duty. It doesn't matter whether it is successful or not successful. That depends on Kṛṣṇa." In this way, anyone, if he works, then he is a //sannyāsī.// Not the dress, but the attitude of working. Yes, that is //sannyāsa. Karyam:// "It is my duty." //Sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca.// He is //yogī,// first-class //yogī.// Just like Arjuna. Arjuna, officially, he did not take //sannyāsa.// He was a //gṛhastha,// soldier. But when he took it very seriously, //karyam//---"Kṛṣṇa wants this fight. Never mind I have to kill my relatives. I must do it"---that is //sannyāsī.// First of all he argued with Kṛṣṇa that "This kind of fighting is not good, family killing," and so on, so on, so on. He argued. But after hearing //Bhagavad-gītā,// when he understood that "It is my duty. Kṛṣṇa wants me to do it." //Karyam.// So in spite of his becoming a householder, a soldier, he's a //sannyāsī.// He took it---//karyam. Karyam// means "It is my duty." That is real //sannyāsī.// "Kṛṣṇa wants that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement must be spread. So this is my //karyam.// This is my duty. And the direction is my spiritual master. So I must do it." This is //sannyāsī.// This is //sannyāsī, sannyāsa// mentality. But there is formality. That should... That may be accepted.

**Indian man (3):**
That has got some psychological effect.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. In India especially, people like. //Sannyāsī// may preach. Otherwise, the formula of //sannyāsa// is given---//karyam:// "//Bās.// This is my only duty. That's all. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should be pushed. This is my only duty." He's //sannyāsī.// Because Kṛṣṇa personally comes, He demands... //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa, He says, //yei kṛṣṇa tattva vettā, sei guru haya// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]: "Anyone who knows the science of Kṛṣṇa, he's //guru.//" And what is the //guru's// business? //Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]: "Whomever you meet, you just try to impress upon him about the instruction of Kṛṣṇa." //Sarva-dharmān parityaja...// So in this way, if we take it up, very seriously---"This is my duty"---then you are a //sannyāsī.// That's all. //Sa sannyāsī.// Kṛṣṇa certifies, //sa sannyāsī.// People are not taking seriously about Kṛṣṇa's teaching. That is India's misfortune. They're bringing so many competition of Kṛṣṇa. "Is Kṛṣṇa..." And "Kṛṣṇa... Rāmakrishna is as good as Kṛṣṇa." This rascaldom has killed. They have done the greatest disservice.

**Indian man:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Instead of Kṛṣṇa, they have brought one rascal, Ramakrishna.

**Bhāgavata:**
They have big //maṭha// in Bhuvaneśvara.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bhāgavata:**
In Bhuvaneśvara, they have big Ramakrishna //maṭha.// Vivekananda School, library, so much land, everything, very organized.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we can do that. You have to convince people. There is no question of making competition with them. But you, you can preach your own philosophy anywhere.

**Indian man (3):**
With that happening with the people in Orissa...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Indian man (3):**
...try to convince them: No, that is false and this is the way. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, their Ramakrishna Mission allurement is that //daridra-nārāyaṇa-seva// and hospital. That is their only allurement. They have no program. Nobody, attracted by their philosophy. And what philosophy they have got? Never mind. We are not concerned with them.

**Madhudviṣa:**
When we were in Māyāpur, I had the idea of...

**Prabhupāda:**
[someone enters] //Aiye.// [Hindi] [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

**Indian man (4):**
[Hindi] Purī Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Purī Mahārāja? Oh? [Bengali]

**Indian lady:**
[Bengali] [shows picture to Prabhupāda]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. This Caitanya Mahāprabhu? Very good. Hang it here. Very good.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Get some rope on it. Get some rope.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, get some rope. Hmm. Just read. [end]
