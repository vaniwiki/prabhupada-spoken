====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...they are killing people. And for the last two thousand years, they could not change that policy. And they are claiming "civilized." They could not follow Jesus Christ's instruction. It is two thousand years. And they are maintaining slaughterhouse. Hmm? What do you think?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Somebody was asking why God consciousness and Christ, just last night.

**Devotee:**
They were saying why not... What about Jesus and Muhammad and other great saints?

**Devotee (2):**
Yes. If Kṛṣṇa's the Supreme Personality of Godhead, why is there Jesus Christ, Muhammad and so on, not only Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
So they are...

**Devotee:**
You replied they were not ready to understand what is Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are so sinful, they could not understand. Therefore it was not spoken. As somewhere Christ has said that "I had to say many things, but I do not say now." What is that?

**Devotee (3):**
Yes. "There is so much to say that..."

**Devotee:**
He says, "Your ears cannot bear it."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. Eh?

**Devotee:**
He said, "There's many things that I have yet to say that your ears cannot bear it."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. I did not remember this. This is the reply. "You are not fit to understand." And to make them fit, he advised, "Thou shall not kill." But they did not take his advice. And whenever they are asked this question, they evade it.

**Devotee:**
It's the most sensitive question to ask.

**Prabhupāda:**
Muhammadans also do not maintain slaughterhouse. They kill animal sacrifice for [indistinct]. They also do not allow unrestricted animal slaughter.

**Devotee:**
Really?

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not allow. Our also, Hindi religion, they do not also allow. Those who are meat-eaters, for them sacrifice before goddess Kālī. That is restriction. [end]
