====== Life Member House Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] this, I can keep it, no? This I can keep it, no?

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] be so loud.

**Prabhupāda:**
Alright. So Śrīla Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, //kīṭa janma hao yathā tuyā dāsa, bahir nā brahma janme nāhi mora āsa. Kītā janma hao yathā tuyā dāsa. Tuyā dāsa// means "your servant." Actually, we are all servants of Kṛṣṇa. //Jīvera svarūpa hoy nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa.// But forgetting our position, we are now acting as //dāsa// of //māyā, māyāra-dāsa. Hoiya māyāra dāsa kori nānā abhilāṣ.// The advantage of //kṛṣṇa-dāsa// is that he has got only one desire: //ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]---to serve Kṛṣṇa purely. That's all. Kṛṣṇa is not impersonal. Kṛṣṇa is person, and whatever He orders, whatever He says, if you carry out faithfully, then our original constitutional position is regained. It can be done very quickly.

Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. And if you do that immediately, then you revive your original position immediately, within a second. //Hoiya māyāra dāsa kori nānā abhilās.// We are making plans in so many ways to be happy. But if we accept this one plan, that immediately surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then our life is successful. And if we do not accept this proposal of Kṛṣṇa, and if we make our own plans to be happy, it will be never be possible. //Hoiya māyāra dāsa kori nānā abhilāṣ. Anādi bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gelā, ataeva māyāra tare goliyā badila.// We are not independent. If we do not agree to serve Kṛṣṇa, then we have to serve //māyā.// Our position as servant is never changed. We remain servant. So if we don't agree to accept Kṛṣṇa's proposal, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], then we have to take shelter of //māyā// and you have to perpetually serve. //Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]].

To serve //māyā// means to continue this material existence one after another. Now I've got this body, you've got this body, and if we do not change our attitude to serve Kṛṣṇa, then we get again next body. There are 8,400,000 different forms of body. We can see. There are so many trees, plants, insects, animals. They're all living entities. Also there are nice body---Americans, Europeans, beautiful body, or demigod's body. There are different bodies, eight million... So long we shall remain //māyā-dāsa,// we have to change this body one after another. It may be of higher standard or it may be of lower standard. That will depend on my work. //Karmaṇā daiva netreṇa jantor deha upapattaye// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. This is the philosophy, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You are... We are not independent. We are completely under the control of material nature, and we get different types of bodies on account of associating with different modes of material nature. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa saṅga asya sad-asad janma yoniṣu// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]].

//Sat, asat.// There are two kinds of status quo: //sat// and //asat. Sat// means nice, or eternal, and //asat// means not very nice. So either you can get the body of the human society or you can get a body in the hog society, dog society. But the activities of the hogs and dogs and human being, if it is carried on in ignorance, eating, sleeping, mating... Then there is no difference. There is no difference. There is no difference to become a hog or to become a man. A man is also eating; hog is also eating according to one's taste. The man is also sleeping; the hog is also sleeping, according to the position. So that does not make any difference between a human being and a hog. But at the present moment we are taken this civilization that hog is eating stool, and if we are eating very nice plate, then you're civilized. But //śāstra// says no. Eating and the taste of eating is the same. Always enjoying eating stool, and you're enjoying eating something else---the taste of eating is the same. There is no difference. You like something; I like something. But the common formula is that you eat, I also eat. Therefore we have to change this formula. If you simply waste our time like the hogs---eating, sleeping, sex-life and defense---then that is not human life.

Human life is meant for //tapasya.// That is not possible by the hogs and dogs. //Tapasya,// austerities. By austerities, by //tapasya,// we can purify our existence. You are existing at the present moment because we are changing body, //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralī...// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]. Therefore it is polluted existence. This is not pure existence. Pure existence is eternal life, blissfulness and knowledge, full of knowledge. That is pure life. So the human life is meant for purifying our existence. Stop this continuation of birth, death, old age and disease and live eternally blissful life of knowledge. That is the business of human life. But people do not take this fact very seriously. They have become so dull-headed. Now, there is freedom from this continuation of birth, death, old age and disease, they cannot believe it. They cannot consider it. They think, "Ah, it is going on." So the modern civilization is quite different from the Vedic civilization. Vedic civilization means to make a solution of this problem: stop this process of birth, death, old age and disease. That is Vedic civilization. That is human civilization. And to become better hog, nicely dressed hog, that is not Vedic civilization. That is hog civilization.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to save people from the hog civilization or dog civilization to human civilization. That is... Human civilization means plain living and advancing in spiritual consciousness, not to increase unnecessarily artificial way of life. But we should know what is the aim of life and try to actually success in the aim of life in any condition. That is Vedic civilization. Any condition. "Any condition" means in the material world we find that somebody is well situated and somebody... We think like that. Nobody is well situated. But we think like that. So if we want to cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness, in any material condition we can do that. //Ahaituky apratihatā.// Any material condition cannot check our advancement in spiritual life. Just like these European, American boys and girls, they're not accustomed to sit down on the ground. In their country that is not their civilization. They sit down very nicely on chairs and very nice apartment. But because they have taken to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they do not hesitate to sit down in any condition of life. This is advancement. They do not grudge that "We are not accustomed to sit in this way." No. That is any condition, any condition of life. Kṛṣṇa also says,

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]

So we can accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness in any condition life. There is no impediment. That is spiritual. That is spiritual. Not that "Unless such and such conditions are fulfilled, I cannot take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness." No. As I told in the beginning, that you can accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness within a second. As Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. So if you immediately take Kṛṣṇa, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa..." You have thoroughly read //Bhagavad-gītā,// then we understand that "We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is asking to surrender. Why not surrender?" That is intelligence. Kṛṣṇa says that is the way of life. Ultimately one has to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. That is the success, ultimate success. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. One is accepting immediately and one is experimenting with truth, and it will take many, many births. //Kleśa adhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta cetasām// [[books:bg:12:5|[Bg. 12.5]]]. Kṛṣṇa is presently instructing in person, and foolish people are thinking that He's imperson.

Why imperson? Kṛṣṇa is always speaking: //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te. Aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. The first person is used everywhere. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. //Aham.// Kṛṣṇa says //aham,// person. So why we should think of Kṛṣṇa being imperson? This is our misfortune. Therefore it takes many, many births. Even one is //jñānavān// it takes many, many births to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. Although he's //jñānavān,// superficially, still his //jñāna// has been taken away. //Māyayā apahṛta-jñānā.// Although he's proud of his knowledge, the //māyā// says, "No, no, no. Why you are accepting Kṛṣṇa as person? He's imperson." So //māyā// is dictating and taking away his knowledge. //Māyayā apahṛta-jñānā.// Kṛṣṇa says //aham,// "I, Me." These are first person, person, first person. And still these people are thinking of Kṛṣṇa as imperson. Why? This is called //māyayā apahṛta-jñānā.// They have studied the Vedic literature but could not understand what is Kṛṣṇa.

So intelligent person, instead of waiting many, many births to understand Kṛṣṇa, may take it immediately what Kṛṣṇa says, as it is. Then his life is successful. So that is possible to understand Kṛṣṇa as He is saying. But because on account of our sinful activities, we cannot understand. //Duṣkṛtina. Duṣkṛtina// means always engaged in sinful activities, very intelligent person, but engaged in sinful activities. Nowadays... All the people are nowadays educated, but all of them, mostly, ninety-nine percent, they're engaged in sinful activities---illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, gambling. These are sinful activities and, in spite of advancement of education all over the world, these things are going on. Therefore they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is understood by a person who is no more engaged in sinful activities.

> yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

So we are trying---this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for this purpose---that stop sinful activities and hear Kṛṣṇa and accept Him as He is saying. Then your life is successful. That's all. Very simple thing. And those who are adopting this ways, this process of life, is becoming successful practically. There is no doubt about it. //Asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu. Asaṁśayam,// without any doubt. //Samagram,// in full, not partial.

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi...
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

So Kṛṣṇa is explaining Himself that //yathā jñāsyasi,// without any doubt, //asaṁśayam,// and //samagram. Samagram// means in fullness, the Absolute Truth in full. The Absolute Truth is realized as Brahman, as Paramātmā, as Bhagavān. So Kṛṣṇa says, "I'm giving you full knowledge, both of Paramātmā and Brahman and My personal knowledge." //Yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu,// "Just hear, hear from Me."

So this is the opportunity in human life. Kṛṣṇa is explaining, God is explaining Himself, and still if you remain dulls and fools and rascals, then it is our misfortune. That is explained //narādhama. Narādhama. Narādhama// cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. //Narādhama,// lowest of the mankind. //Narādhama. Nara// means man, and //adhama// means lowest. So those who are //narādhama,// they will escape this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Otherwise, anyone who is intelligent, intelligent after many, many births' experience, he'll accept. So we can understand by this crucial test or test tube[?] what is what.

So anyway, our business is you Western boys and girls, you have taken this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement very seriously. I'm very much thankful to you. So try to make the people //uttama,// although at the present moment they are //narādhama,// without understanding Kṛṣṇa. So these are not exaggeration. This is stated in the //śāstra.// And our point is that anyone who is not taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he's among these groups---//duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayā apahṛta-jñānā āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.// The basic principle is //āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ. Asura. Asura// means against God always. Rāvaṇa was //asura.// Hiraṇyakaśipu was //asura.// They are very learned scholar, son of a //brāhmaṇa// and very powerful. The only fault was they did not believe in God; therefore they are called //asuras.// So anyone who does not believe in God, he's //asura.// This is the verdict of the //śāstra.// And this asuric civilization is going on all over the world. So we are making little effort to make the //asuras// devotees. That's all. This is our business.

So we are very much thankful to Mr. Pulla Reddy. He has given us a place, very important place, and you are constructing temple. He's always eager to help us. Therefore he's a //bhakta.// We are very much thankful to him. He's a //bhakta.// So at any moment Mr. Pulla Reddy will call us. We are ready to come here, because he's a //bhakta. Mad-bhakta pūjyā adhikaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa likes if you honor the //bhakta.// Kṛṣṇa is very much pleased. "If you love me, love my dog." We have seen in the Western countries when two gentlemen meet, he pats his friend's dog and he pats the friend's dog. That you have seen it. [laughs] First of all dog, "How are you? How are you?" [laughter] So let us all become dogs of Kṛṣṇa, and //bhaktas// will love us. [laughter]

Thank you very much. [end]
