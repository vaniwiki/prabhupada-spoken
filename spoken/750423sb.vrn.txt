"The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyāsadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth."

**Prabhupāda:**

//Sātvata// means eternal, and //saṁhitā// means Vedic literature. Vedic literature... //Veda// means knowledge. There are two kinds of knowledge: material knowledge and spiritual knowledge. Material knowledge means regarding these necessities of this body. So our educational system, the university, everything, that is simply imparting material knowledge. But material knowledge is superfluous because this body is also superfluous. Every one of us, we know that this body is nonpermanent. It is temporary. We create a certain type of situation, and we get a particular type of body, and we enjoy or suffer. There is no question of enjoyment; it is suffering. Just like we are running on this fan because the body is suffering. Otherwise, there is no necessity of this fan. And we require this light because without light the eyes will suffer.

So actually our material knowledge, we have discovered this electricity just to counteract these sufferings of this material body. //Kaṣṭān kāmān// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. This body is therefore //anartha. Anartha// means things which are not required. That is called //anartha. Artha// means things which we require, positive. And //anartha// means things which we do not require but unnecessarily imposed upon us. So that is suffering. We are thinking that we are enjoying this electric fan, but actually we are suffering; therefore the electric fan is required. So why this electric fan is required? Because the body is //anartha;// it has created the situation. The same electric fan will be a trouble, a misery, in winter season. The same body, the same electric fan---sometimes it is pleasing, and sometimes it is not pleasing. Therefore the conclusion is this body is //anartha,// not required. But people do not know that without this material body we can exist. Actually we are existing in spiritual body, and this material body is a covering of the spiritual body. Just like your shirt and coat are covering of your real body, similarly, this material body is covering of the spiritual body. We have got our spiritual body. So when a person comes to the understanding that "This body is //anartha,// unnecessarily imposed upon me," that is called knowledge. That is called //brahma-jñāna. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]].

So in order to educate people to this understanding... That is the basic principle of all Vedic knowledge, that "I am not this body. I am spirit soul, and I must find out the ultimate goal of the spiritual body, or the spirit soul." So some of the transcendentalists, they think that if the spirit soul is merged into the Supreme Soul---that is called //brahma-liṅ,// to become one with Brahman---that is the solution of this //anartha. Anartha// means this body. And some of them, they think that with our spiritual body, spiritual vision, if we can observe continuously the Supreme Spirit, Paramātmā, then that is the solution of //anartha.// That is the //yogī. Jñānī, yogī.// And the //karmīs,// those who have no knowledge, //ajānataḥ,// fools, rascals... //Ajānataḥ// means one who does not know. That is the //karmīs. Karmīs,// they think that "If I can satisfy the senses of this body, that is perfection of life."

So there are three kinds of philosophers to make the solution of this unwanted material body, //anartha.// But actual solution is to remain in your spiritual body and meet the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face and live with Him in eternal blissful life of knowledge. That is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. The Māyāvādī philosophy or the //jñānīs// and //yogīs// and //karmīs...// Try to understand. The //karmīs// want to enjoy the senses of this body. Because the body is //anartha,// therefore sense gratification is another //anartha.// Because in this body you are enjoying certain type or certain grade of material enjoyment, sense gratification, and if you want more than that... Just like there are prescription, menu, of human food: vegetable, rice, wheat, sugar. This is actually the food for the human being. But if one hasn't got restriction within the area of the allotted foodstuff... Because we have to accept allotted foodstuff. Everything is food, but the human being has got an allotted foodstuff by the Supreme Lord. //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. That Supreme Personality of Godhead is supplying everyone foodstuff. But not that the dogs' and hogs' foodstuff is the same for the human kind. No. //Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. You should enjoy as it is allotted by the Supreme Lord.

So if we transgress this law... Our constitutional position, anatomical fittings, is to eat fruit, vegetable, rice, wheat, milk or milk product. This is our constitutional position. But if we imitate the cats and dog, without any discrimination if we eat, then my next body is ready, the hog's body or the dog's body. This is natural law. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. As you associate with different types of material modes of nature, then you get the next body accordingly. Therefore on the whole, the body, either human body or demigod's body or cat's body or dog's body or tree's body or plant's body, it is unnecessary. Unnecessarily we have accepted this material body, because our position is not this body. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. We are losing every time a particular type of body. But I am eternal. But people are so foolish, so rascal, they do not understand that "If I am eternal, why I have to change my body?" This is intelligence.

So that intelligence is there. Here it is said, //lokasya ajānataḥ.// The rascals, the fools, //ajānataḥ,// foolish... //Ajānataḥ// is another meaning of foolish. //Ajānataḥ, ajñāna,// without any knowledge how we can stop this perpetual... Not perpetual, but at least for the time being, why we are subjected to these //anartha?// This is the enquiry. This is called //brahma-jijñāsā.// But they do not know it. Ask anybody of this material world that "What is the cause of your suffering?" They cannot explain. They do not know it. Therefore it is particularly mentioned, //ajānataḥ:// "They do not know how to mitigate this suffering." Therefore //vidvān. Vidvān,// one who has got full knowledge, Vyāsadeva, he has made this //sātvata-saṁhitām. Saṁhitā// means Vedic knowledge, and //sātvata// means pure, completely pure, or for the Vaiṣṇavas or the perfect spiritualists. //Lokasya ajānataḥ vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām// [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]. How we can utilize this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sātvata-saṁhitā?// That is also explained in the next verse,

> yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyāṁ
> kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe
> bhaktir utpadyate puṁsaḥ
> śoka-moha-bhayāpahā
> [[books:sb:1:7:7|[SB 1.7.7]]]

//Śoka-moha-bhaya,// these things are our constant companion. //Śoka. Śoka// means lamenting, and //moha// means illusion. And //bhaya, bhaya// means fearfulness. So we are embarrassed with these things always: //śoka, moha// and //bhaya. Śoka:// we are always lamenting, "This thing I have lost." "I have lost this business," "I have lost my son," "I have lost...," so many. Because it is, after all, a losing business. To exist in this material world means it is a losing business. There will be no profit. Therefore whatever we are working for, searching after, real happiness, if it is not devotional service, then the //Bhāgavata// says, //śrama eva hi kevalam// [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]: "Simply working for nothing, and the gain is labor."

So people are suffering in this way. Although they do not know, they are taking it as enjoying. That is illusion. //Moha.// That is called //moha.// So we are in the //śoka,// always in lamentation. But we are accepting this //śoka// position as enjoyable. //Śoka-moha.// And the result is that we are always fearful. //Bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syāt// [SB 11.2.37]. This //bhayam...// That is the material nature: eating, sleeping, sex life and //bhayam. Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca// [//Hitopadeśa//]. This is the bodily business: eating, sleeping, sex life and always fearful, "What will happen next? What will happen next?" These are the //anarthas.// Actually, we are part and parcel of the //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]: eternal, //sat;// full of knowledge, //sat-cit;// and bliss, //ānanda,// pleasure. This is our life. But this is not our life---eating, sleeping, mating and //bhayam.// These things are required only //dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syāt,// when we identify with the //dvitīya,// means the second. Second means I am not this body, but the body is the second feature. So when I identify myself with this body, that is called //dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ.// And on account of our thoughts being absorbed in the secondary body, we are suffering.

So if we want to get relief from this suffering, then it is recommended, //yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām.// If we regularly hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// this //sātvata-saṁhitā... Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām// [[books:sb:1:7:7|[SB 1.7.7]]]. //Śrūyamāṇa// means simply hearing, //śravaṇam.// Then, by hearing, what will be the effect? The effect will be //kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe, kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe bhaktir utpadyate// [[books:sb:1:7:7|[SB 1.7.7]]]: "The Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa, unto Him your devotional service will be increased." Because //anartha upaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.// The remedy has been described that if you be engaged in the devotional service of Adhokṣaja... //Adhokṣaja// means the Supreme Person who is beyond your material experience. That is called //adhokṣaja. Akṣaja// means material, and //adhah-kṛta,// where material knowledge fails, that is called //adhokṣaja.// So if you be engaged in devotional service upon this Adhokṣaja... And who is that Adhokṣaja? That is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa you cannot understand by the material knowledge. They are studying Kṛṣṇa with material knowledge, but it is not possible. That is said by Kṛṣṇa Himself in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that //yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ. Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]: "I am not exposed to everyone, because the //yogamāyā// is covering their eyes." In another place Kṛṣṇa says, //avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]: "Because I have come here to favor these people of this world..." These rascals, //mūḍha---mūḍha// means rascal---they are deriding; they are thinking Kṛṣṇa as one of us. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is //adhokṣaja.// If you want to see Kṛṣṇa by your material speculation, you will never be able to see Kṛṣṇa. //Yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ.//

But one may say that "I can see Kṛṣṇa by my pious activities." No, that also not possible. "I can see Kṛṣṇa by my philosophical speculation"---no, that is also not possible. "I can see Kṛṣṇa by practicing //yoga//---that is also not possible. Then how it is possible? Kṛṣṇa says, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. This particular process you have to accept, //bhaktyā.// That is called //bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.// Everything is there symmetrically in every Vedic literature. We have to take advantage of it and benefit ourself. So the summary is that Kṛṣṇa is beyond your material experimental knowledge. You cannot understand Kṛṣṇa by these material senses. It is not possible. Then //bhakti-yoga. Bhakti-yoga. Bhakti// means to engage oneself in the service. The more you engage in the service of the Lord, more you realize what is Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise, it is not possible. If you don't accept //bhakti-yoga,// if you accept //jñāna-yoga, karma-yoga// or //haṭha-yoga,// then you can make some material progress, but there is no possibility of understanding Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is recommended here the //bhakti-yogam// particularly. Everywhere it is made, //bhakti-yoga. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]].

So the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is further explanation of the knowledge given in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So it is recommended also that we have to hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// always, twenty-four hours. Not that //bhāgavata-saptāha.// It is a business. //Bhāgavata-saptāha// is not recommended in anywhere in authorized scripture. There are many big, big commentators of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam//---Śrīdhara Svāmī, Vīrarāghavācārya, Viśvanātha Cakravartī, Jīva Gosvāmī and many other. There are eight authorized. Nowhere you will find //bhāgavata-saptāha// is recommended. Nowhere. //Bhāgavata// should be studied every day. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.// That is recommended. //Naṣṭa-prāyeṣv abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. //Nityam. Nityam// means always, at least daily. So these temples are meant for hearing //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// daily. That is wanted. Not that I make a ceremony, I hear for one week. Without understanding a word of //Bhāgavata,// I hear for one week, and the business is finished. No. You have to hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// daily, regularly. Then //anartha upaśamaṁ sākṣāt.// This //sātvata-saṁhitā// is given by Śrīla Vyāsadeva so that... We are fools, rascal, //ajānataḥ, ajānataḥ. Lokasya ajānataḥ.// All these fools and rascals, if they hear with great attention from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// about the activities and glories of Kṛṣṇa... //Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyāṁ kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe// [[books:sb:1:7:7|[SB 1.7.7]]]. He is the //parama-puruṣa.// That is the verdict of all Vedic literature. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. He is //īśvara, parama-puruṣa,// the Supreme Person. //Īśvara// means the Supreme Person. In the English dictionary also it is said, "//God// means the Supreme Person." God means the Supreme Person. So that Supreme Person is Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "There is no more superior authority than Me." But people do not understand, because //ajānataḥ. Ajānataḥ// means without any knowledge.

So we have to take knowledge from //Bhagavad-gītā// or //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// about Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe bhaktir utpadyate.// If you hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...// Of course, if you do not understand what is the basic principle of Kṛṣṇa or basic principle of perfection... That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// in the beginning: //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavaḥ atra paramo nirmatsarāṇām// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. Here in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// the so-called manufactured religious system is kicked out. It is meant for the //paramahaṁsa. Nirmatsarāṇām. Nirmatsara// means one who does not become envious. So our enviousness, our envy, has begun from Kṛṣṇa. We don't accept Kṛṣṇa. Mostly they will say, "Why Kṛṣṇa should be only the Supreme Person? There are many others." That is envy. So our enviousness has begun from Kṛṣṇa, and therefore it has expanded in so many ways. And in our ordinary life we are envious. We are envious of our friends, envious of our father, our son even, what to speak of others---businessmen, nation, society, community, only enviousness, //matsaratā.// "Why he should go ahead?" I become envious. This is material nature. So when one understands Kṛṣṇa---he is Kṛṣṇa conscious---he becomes nonenvious, no more envious. He wants to become friend. //Suhṛdaḥ sarva-bhūtānām.//

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we want to become friends of everyone. Because they are suffering without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we are going door to door, city to city, village to village, town to town to preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And by the grace of Kṛṣṇa we are attracting the attention of intelligent class of men. So if we continue this process, not to become envious... That is animal nature, dog's nature, hog's nature. Human nature should be //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// One should be very unhappy by seeing others in miserable condition. So everyone is suffering for want of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Our only business is to awaken his Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and the whole world will be happy. //Anartha upaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje, lokasya ajānataḥ.// People have no knowledge about it. So we have to push on this movement. //Lokasyājān..., vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// So another name of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is //bhāgavata-dharma. Bhāgavata-dharma.// If we accept it, then the whole human society will be happy.

Thank you very much.
