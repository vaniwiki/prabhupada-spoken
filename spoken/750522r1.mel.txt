====== Room Conversation with Two Lawyers and Photographer ======

**Madhudviṣa:**
...who are here, they would like to have your association, [laughter] more personal association.

**Prabhupāda:**
I also like. [laughter] //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.// This is essential, to be anxious to be associated with the spiritual master. //Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. That is the statement of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. By the mercy of Kṛṣṇa one comes in touch with the bona fide spiritual master, and by the mercy of spiritual master, one gets Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa is in everyone's heart. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Kṛṣṇa can understand what we want. So when we sincerely want Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa sends His representative, //guru. Guru// is outside representative of Kṛṣṇa. So to the sincere student, Kṛṣṇa teaches from inside and outside. That is the way, so that he becomes quickly fit for going back to home, back to Godhead. So this behavior, to be attached to spiritual master, is a good qualification. //Yasya prasādāt,// by his mercy, Kṛṣṇa becomes merciful. By Kṛṣṇa's mercy, one gets spiritual master, and by the spiritual master's mercy, one gets the mercy of Kṛṣṇa.

So your this behavior, attachment, is very much appreciated both by Kṛṣṇa and devotees. So continue this attitude and follow the instruction. Then it is guaranteed, go back to home, back to Godhead. It is not difficult. For a sincere person to go back to home, back to Godhead, is not at all difficult. Especially Kṛṣṇa in this age has personally appeared as Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very, very kind to the fallen souls. //Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo.// His business was with all the //pāpī// and //tāpī. Pāpī// means sinful, and //tāpī// means suffering. //Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo...// [to child, who has been whispering throughout:] Sit down.

**Woman:**
I must give him tissues.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo.// So His business was //pāpī-tāpī?// No. His business was with the most exalted personalities like... //Śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda, śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta.// They were all very exalted personalities. But all of their mission was to deliver the //pāpī-tāpīs.// That we have described in our that small book, //Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya in Five Features.// So //pāpī-tāpī// is everyone, in this age especially. But if we take shelter of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, by His mercy we get everything. So now Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda has come to Melbourne, very nicely looking. So keep yourself always engaged in the service of the Lord. //Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārjanādau. Śrī-vigrahārādhana,// this //arcana// process, beginning from //maṅgala-ārātrika// up to the //śayana-ārātrika,// everything should be done very nicely. And the temple should remain very clean. //Tan-mandira-mārjanādau.// To dress the Deity is as much important as to cleanse the temple also, not that temple will remain dirty, simply you are dressing the Deity. No. Everything within the temple should be kept very, very neat and clean. And the more you keep the temple neat and clean, you will be neat and clean within your heart. And then your understanding will be very easy. We cannot understand Kṛṣṇa, because our heart is piled up with many garbage. That we have to cleanse. Then it will be easy to understand Kṛṣṇa.

So I am very much pleased that we have secured this nice building. Keep it very neat and clean and go on chanting. You have got nice place for chanting and dancing. And utilize the open land for growing flower. In this way make this center unique. And it is a recognized building. If people understand that this building is now a temple and very nicely kept, people will come and see. So keep yourself always in touch with the principles and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and those who are... All of you, I think, you are educated. Read books. Try to understand the philosophy. Then your life is successful.

Thank you very much for your coming.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [offer obeisances]

**Prabhupāda:**
All of them are resident?

**Madhudviṣa:**
Residents?

**Prabhupāda:**
Resident in this temple?

**Madhudviṣa:**
We would like them all to be residents. But some of them find it little difficult to be residents.

**Prabhupāda:**
Make it suitable. Hmm. All right.

**Madhudviṣa:**
They don't want to go.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. [laughter] [end]
