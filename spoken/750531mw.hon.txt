====== Morning Walk on Waikiki Beach ======

**Śrutakīrti:**
[introducing recording] This morning Śrīla Prabhupāda's morning walk takes place on Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, on May 31st, 1975. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...he thinks, "I am on the surf," then next life he will be fish.

**Bali-mardana:**
All the surfers will be fish? If they think that within the water, they will be fish. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...evolution.

**Bali-mardana:**
Then they have to come all the way back to the human form of life. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...childhood we used to play one chessboard, that one serpent is there. If the, what is called, the //guti//[?]?

**Devotee:**
Snake?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Dice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Dice, yes. If the dice falls on the face of the serpent, immediately it comes down. We have to come to the tail.

**Śrutakīrti:**
Back to the start.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is like that. //Goloka-nadha//[?]. One is trying to go to back to home, back to Godhead. A little discrepancy... Mahārāja Bhārata? Yes, he became deer. Therefore we should be very careful. That is the instruction. Even Mahārāja Bhārata, he fell down. So therefore how much careful we should be. These are the instructions to become careful. //Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ// [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]], always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will save you. That Kṛṣṇa chanting and hearing, that will keep us safe. Example is given, just like a polluted woman is doing all household work, but she is always thinking when she will meet with her paramour at night. This example. Similarly, we may be engaged in different material activities, but if we keep our faith in Kṛṣṇa, then it will save us. It is possible. Just like the example: the woman is engaged in household affairs very diligently, but she is always thinking when she will meet her paramour.

**Bali-mardana:**
If we keep that example in mind, then it becomes easier.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. Another example is given. In South India there are a class of dancer. They keep a waterpot on the head, and they will dance, but it will not fall down. Careful.

[break] //...kṛṣṇa-padaravindayor kṣīṇa-tavābhrāṇi ca sākaṁ pramodaḥ.// If we remember always Kṛṣṇa, then all our inauspicity is driven away, and prosperity increases. //Sākaṁ pramodaḥ.// [break] ... You know a little Sanskrit, they will see the composition of //Bhāgavatam// so fine. It is not possible to be composed now.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Sweet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Five thousand years ago it was composed by Vyāsadeva. [break] ...only for the Juhu Beach so many hotels are being maintained. Even this Holiday Inn, they have also.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Juhu Beach is a big beach.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Yes. [break] ...I told you, in my childhood I was consulting the timetable, "What is the fare of Jagannātha Purī and Vṛndāvana?" [chuckles]

**Gurukṛpa:**
You said it was two rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not two rupees. Jagannātha Purī at that time was four rupees, four annas or one anna. And Vṛndāvana was six rupees.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Six.

**Prabhupāda:**
Six rupees from Calcutta. So I was dreaming, "When I get this four rupees or six rupees, I shall." [break]

**Gurukṛpa:**
That is not material.

**Bali-mardana:**
You were desiring to worship... You were worshiping Jagannātha, weren't you?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Ratha-yātrā.

**Bali-mardana:**
You wanted to go and visit Purī?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break]

**Gurukṛpa:**
All the people come out on their porch and they watch us. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...sea, you can... Water is so clear, ten feet down you can see clear.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Any sea, anywhere. When I was traveling by ship, I used to see ten feet down crystal clear. It is very clear water.

**Gurukṛpa:**
But you cannot drink it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is God's supremacy. "If I don't give you water to drink, you cannot drink." And still, they are independent. Just see the fun. Even water, three-fourths of water, you cannot use a drop of water for drinking unless God gives you. He creates the cloud and give you. That is not your arrangement. You cannot do. Still they are independent. //Jale kali-vāsa, nāme tila phyāsa//[?]. Sometimes sailors, for being thirsty, they died in water. How they declare independence from Him? "There is no God. There is no authority. We are independent. We can do whatever we like." Childish.

**Gurukṛpa:**
I think it's because they are meat-eaters, all their intelligence is completely gone.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Vinā pasughnat// [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]: unless one is meat-eater, nobody can be disinterested in God's affairs. Only the meat-eaters, //vinā paśughnāt,// killers of animal. //Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt// [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]. This glorification of God is especially done by persons who are completely free from material attachment. //Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagiyamanad bhavauśādhi.// And it is the medicine of getting free from this material bondage. //Bhavauśādhi.// And it is also very pleasing. Otherwise, why they come to hear the Hare Kṛṣṇa? It's such a nice thing. Who does not like it unless he is a killer of animals? So even the killer of animals, they also hear. It is so nice. Only the gross killers, most abominable, they do not hear it.

**Gurukṛpa:**
Last night we saw groups of people on and off going by, holding their ears. They were putting their fingers in their ears.

**Prabhupāda:**

> nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād
> bhavauṣadhi chrotra-mano 'bhirāmāt
> [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]

[break]

**Devotee:**
Hawaiians, they are not very much inclined to read. So does that mean we should distribute lots of //prasādam// here profusely?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee:**
The Hawaiian people, they don't read very much, but they like to eat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Give them, yes. [end]
