====== Talk during massage ======

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
At a lot of the universities in the United States, they have what is called Free University. It’s a part of the college, and, like, almost anybody can give classes there, and it’s open to the entire student body.

**Prabhupada:**
[indistinct].

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yeah, right.

**Prabhupada:**
You have studied Judah’s book?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, I have.

**Prabhupada:**
And he has got letter that "I realize that you have converted these drug-addicted hippies to be servant of Kṛṣṇa and [indistinct]." That is their appreciation. And that is a fact. They are surprised that these drug-addicted, most fallen boys, they have given up everything and now they are pure devotees.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Well, it isn't surprising...

**Prabhupada:**
No, any sane man will think. There are so many //svāmīs, yogīs// coming. They cannot do anything. They remain the same, drug-addicted. Either Guru-ji Maharaj or this or that, Maharishi Yogi. They remain the same rascals. Do they change? That they are observing. That is the wonderful thing. //Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. If one becomes perfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he is fully surrendered: "I have got everything..." Then he becomes all-perfect. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Sarvair guṇais,// all good qualities. Otherwise, what is the meaning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness? He becomes the perfect. And without any greed. All greed is finished. He is satisfied in Kṛṣṇa. He becomes happy. And so long he is... Now he is satisfied to jump like monkey---from this platform, that platform, all temporary, unhappy. Here is your love: jumping. So try to administer this. Especially in your country, [indistinct], and you will remain happy. Otherwise, simply the running car and skyscraper will not make you happy. I think you are already realizing.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Our parents were raised in the farms.

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Our parents, most of our parents, were raised in the farms or their parents were raised in farming. And then their children went to the city, and all the buildings, and many people went to the city, and now their children are going back into the farms. So they’re trying the other way. It’s going back into that direction.

**Prabhupada:**
The farmers' children, they are leaving their farms. I have seen. In New Vrindaban, the farmers' children are not following. The father is working, and the boy has gone for education in the city, never to come back. Just like our Indian boys, they come here and they do not go back home. Material facilities they find more attractive. All varieties of vegetables, fresh fruit. In India still they have got many farm like that. I went with my father when I was about twelve years, thirteen years old, a remote family in the village. From the railway station it was twenty-four miles each way, and we had to go there. In those days there was no bus; this bullock cart. And I stayed there three, four days. The fresh vegetables, and //ghee,// nice rice, nice puffed rice, molasses. They gave me for breakfast this puffed rice mixed with molasses and cream. And then first-class rice, //ḍāl,// vegetables, //ghee,// cow's //ghee,// milk. And everything will be within the reach. You haven’t got to go to the store. The rice is there, //ḍāl// is there, the vegetables, in the garden, the milk is there, the //ghee.// Remote village, and they are independent.

My father was doing cloth business; he was customer. They bring cloth. Formerly the cloth was also being manufactured in the village. And in Bengal, the system was that four, five men dig a big lake, and with the mud they prepare their house. Mud walls, that’s good as brick. It is not fired. Raw. That is very good. So you get water by digging the lake, and all around there are cottages. And little farther you have got your land, grow your food. Those who are fish eaters, they are keeping fish farm. Everything fresh. No one had to go to the city. Nowadays, this city capitalist, they sold their market, and he will get five hundred dollars. He thought that "We are not... Money is very scarce in the village. Let us go to the city and spend." You get five hundred dollars but you have to spend eight hundred dollars. Then he will learn how to drink, how to go to cinema, how to go to restaurant, how to go to club. Then gambling. All good things.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
You don’t think that it will be difficult, then, to convince people to move back to the farms once they learn that it is the right thing to do? Because everyone has been taught that the right thing to do is to, in America, is to live in the cities and make money and this and that. They don’t know...

**Prabhupada:**
You... Our people should show example, just like we are trying to do in New Vrindaban, that you grow your food, and [indistinct] milk, weave your cloth. And little school, and chant.

**Govinda dāsī:**
This philosophy is going on here in Hawaii. I mean, there are many..., not just devotees; there are many other people...

**Prabhupada:**
This is peaceful. Unless one is peaceful, how it is possible to awaken Kṛṣṇa consciousness? So peacefulness means you require eating, sleeping, mating, defending. So adjust it in such way and save time. We are not denying these things---these are necessities---but in a organized, planned way. That we are doing. When the attraction is Kṛṣṇa... Otherwise he will be attracted by the city. So, it is all in your hands. So village to village, organize this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We don’t want to stop this material activity. That is not our goal. But if people remain satisfied in country life, sustained living, that will be better for them. But the government does not like village independence. The leaders?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
No, they promote city life. I think that they consider city life to be more money-making. They make more money for themselves.

**Prabhupada:**
Money-making for the big capitalists.

**Ambarīṣa:**
More or less they’ve polluted the agricultural way too by agribusiness, it’s called now. The businessman in the city owns the land, and it’s made into business. It’s not simple village life anymore.

**Prabhupada:**
No. Just like we saw the other land, they are growing huge quantity of sugar cane. That is business. Instead of producing food for the residents of the land, they are producing sugar cane to export. That is business.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
It’s like here in Hawaii, the Dole Pineapple Company, they produce so much pineapple they’ve utilized almost all year all the land in Hawaii...

**Prabhupada:**
That is trade.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...and they overproduce every year, and then they..., so much of it rots. So much of it is wasted.

**Prabhupada:**
Oh.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They can’t sell it.

**Prabhupada:**
And vegetables they are bringing from the mainland.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupada:**
Just see.

**Govinda dāsī:**
They grow nothing but pineapple, sugar cane and beef, cows for eating, and they import the vegetables from the mainland. It’s insane.

**Prabhupada:**
So the pineapple they export abroad?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yeah, they'll export some of it, but they can’t export the entire crop, so a lot of it just rots in the fields.

**Prabhupada:**
Oh, it is a waste.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yeah, it is a waste.

**Prabhupada:**
So if, I think, they will give it to the cows, it can be utilized.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Cows can eat pineapple?

**Prabhupada:**
They will eat anything. There is no question of wasting. That if we give the fruits, grains, you take the best part, and the refuse part you give to the animals. Any fruit you take, the skin and other things you give to the cows, they will eat. Grains, you take the inner part; the substandard skin you give them, they will eat. There is no expenditure for maintaining cows. And in exchange, they are giving you milk. No expenditure for you, and you... They are not drinking the milk, it is for you. She is giving milk: "So give me a little shelter. There is no expenditure for you. I will eat from the field, and whatever refuse you don't take, you give me. I will give you fresh milk. Don’t cut my throat." A rascal civilization. And they want peace. They don’t want atom bomb. They don’t want war. Nonsense. You must be killed every moment. So these sinful activities are accumulated, then war is declared---finished, whole civilization. This is going on. All these big wars are started in the Western countries. They are so sinful. Bomb. "//Rrr.// You have created your H bomb, your atom bomb." Men, money and assets, everything finished, again... This is going on.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
People in America, they are under the illusion that there can never be a war on the mainland.

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
People in America are under the illusion that there will never be a war on the mainland of America, because there never has been...

**Prabhupada:**
They are believing in so many things.

**Govinda dāsī:**
I’ve heard that you have said there will be a war soon.

**Prabhupada:**
Now, how this atom bomb will be used unless there is war? They have... Everyone has stock of atom bomb. So why these atom bombs are there?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
There's so many of them, too.

**Prabhupada:**
It must be utilized for war. There must be war. There must be war.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Won’t this be an impediment to the preaching work?

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Won’t this be an...

**Prabhupada:**
The Russia and America is prepared to fight at any moment.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
This would destroy the cities.

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They would destroy the cities.

**Prabhupada:**
And all rogues are ready. China, Russia, America especially. And all other small countries. Just like in every war. India has nothing to do with these Western countries, and these rascals, Britishers, they involved India also, British Empire. Unless they involve India, they cannot utilize Indian soldiers. And they won victory only for Indian soldiers, the Sikh soldiers.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Does the Indian government want war?

**Prabhupada:**
Yes.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They do?

**Prabhupada:**
Yes. Indian government, that was British government, British government. They implicated. And in the peace conference, one Indian, S. P. Sinha, made him Lord. The Britishers bribed him, made him Lord. And he spoke to the peace conference, "Yes, India wants the Britishers' help to develop." Because there the question was why Britishers were in, occupying India. And because the real cause of war, Germany. The Germany, they wanted to trade with India and other parts of the world, and the British Empire will not allow them. As soon as German goods are there, they will charge fifty percent customs. And the same thing they will take from Germany and Japan and stamp it "Made in England." And they have made... Because India was in their hands, they made propaganda, anything, any damn thing made in England is first class. So Germans saw that "Our goods, this rascal shopkeeper nation, they are purchasing and stamping "Made in England," and we cannot sell our goods. This is the cause of war. "Finish these rascals." That was the cause. And they finished. [snaps fingers] Although Germans themselves became finished, but they finished the Britishers. That’s a fact. They finished. After this war, Britishers were finished. They lost India. They were finished. Their determination was [indistinct]. Biggest haters of these Britishers are the Germans. They do not like to speak in English. Do you know that?

**Govinda dāsī:**
No.

**Prabhupada:**
The German people... This I am [indistinct]. The late Kaiser, he was grandson of Queen Victoria. His mother the daughter of Queen Victoria. So they are relative. So when he was a boy he was in England [indistinct], somehow or other he cut his finger... [break] ...and the lame man gives his direction, "Go this way," then both of them will be finished. So Indian culture and American money, if it is combined, the whole world will be changed. //Andha...//

**Ambarīṣa:**
Such a good proposal.

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Ambarīṣa:**
It’s such a good proposal.

**Prabhupada:**
//Andha-paṅgu-nyāya.// This is Sanskrit. It is called //Andha-paṅgu-nyāya. Paṅgu// means lame; //andha// means blind. The logic of blind and lame. Very good example. Yes.

**Ambarīṣa:**
First the Americans will have to see how they are blind.

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Ambarīṣa:**
First the Americans...

**Prabhupada:**
Yes, they are blind with wealth.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Hmm.

**Prabhupada:**
//Dhana-durmadāndha.// As soon as you become very rich, you become blind; you don’t care for anything. This is blind. That is described, //Dhana-durmadāndha. Dhana// means riches. When a man gets too much wealth, he becomes blind. Puffed up. [indistinct]. So that is natural. As soon as you get enough money, you become blind. Therefore, to possess very large amount of money is an hindrance to spiritual advancement. The rich man thinks that "What is this nonsense? These poor men, they have no money so they have to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." He thinks, "Ah, we don’t have to chant. We have got enough. These people have no food, no shelter; they have to chant." This is blind. The Hare Kṛṣṇa is required for everyone, that they do not understand. They think it is required for the poor man. They have no other business, and they are chanting in the street. That's all. Do they not think that?

**Ambarīṣa:**
They are thinking that chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa is for material benefit.

**Prabhupada:**
[laughing] Yes. They have taken a [indistinct] and begging form us. Therefore they are blind. They do not know. That is Professor Judah's book, that Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is so much misunderstood. He has taken the labor of presenting his book so that any sane man will understand what is the importance of this movement. He is good man. Out of his good feeling that such a nice movement is being misunderstood, so he has attempted to drive away that misconception about Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. That is very good service. And he will be benefited, he has done such service. Now it is in your hands. I am now old man, at any moment. You, you take it seriously. There are books, and push it. People will be happy. Plain living and spiritual advancement, they do not understand. They do not know there is anything as spiritual advancement.

**Ambarīṣa:**
No, they don’t...

**Prabhupada:**
Yes.

**Ambarīṣa:**
...realize what spirit is.

**Prabhupada:**
Yes. "What is this nonsense spiritual life?" They think like that.

**Ambarīṣa:**
And yet they are... Many people who are so materially advanced, they are so unhappy.

**Prabhupada:**
No, they will say, "We will make solution for the [inaudible]. Just we are trying." They are trying, trying, trying, trying, [laughing] trying, trying.

**Ambarīṣa:**
And they blame others for their unhappiness.

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Ambarīṣa:**
They blame others for their unhappiness.

**Prabhupada:**
What is that?

**Ambarīṣa:**
Like where I live, someone..., like say a woman is unhappy in her life, you know, she would blame her husband: "Oh, it is your fault that I am unhappy. I have all this, but you do not give me love," and so forth.

**Prabhupada:**
That is everywhere, husbands, wives quarreling. That is not... The husband is thinking, "The wife is the cause of my unhappiness," and wife is thinking that "My husband is the cause of my unhappiness."

**Govinda dāsī:**
My unhappiness?

**Prabhupada:**
They are, on the whole, both of them unhappy. Cause may be different, but the both of them unhappy, that’s a fact. And when there is unhappiness, that is I accuse you, you accuse me. But it is a fact, both are unhappy. That they do not know. //Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam.// [break] "Why you are unhappy? Let us live peacefully." That also you will not be allowed. You have to give up that position, because you have to of tried[?]. If you make compromise, "All right, let us... It is little inconvenient; let us compromise and live peacefully." But you cannot live even. You have to die... [break] ...at any moment. No better food---or stale meat and frozen vegetables, all rotten. And then wine, just like //asuric,// this is their food. They have to live like that. And they are going on thinking this is civilization. This is //māyā.//

**Govinda dāsī:**
It seems they’re forced.

**Prabhupada:**
They must work in that way because they are neglecting Kṛṣṇa. //Māyā.// will go on kicking like anything, and they will think it is happiness. This is called illusion. //Māyā// is kicking, that "You rascal, you have forgotten Kṛṣṇa. I will punish you every moment." That is going on. And he is thinking, "I am happy." This is called //māyā.// He is not come to the senses, that "Here I can not be happy. Best thing is finish this material business, go back to home." That is intelligence. That is intelligence. They are not intelligent. They have no common sense, because they cannot understand transmigration of the soul. So dull-headed. That Professor Stillson Judah has understood the importance of the movement, that he said that "Your, the movement is so exalted that you have brought the drug-addicted hippies to this platform of serving Kṛṣṇa and the humanity." Now people are realizing, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so exalted that if one is actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he will know that "I don’t require anything." //Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ yasmin sthito..., guruṇāpi vicālyate// [[books:bg:6:20-23|[Bg. 6.22]]]. If one is situated strongly on the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then even in the severest type of material miserable condition, he will not forget Kṛṣṇa. Tolerant. He will not hesitate. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He will stand fixed-up, "Yes, I don’t forget Kṛṣṇa." That is the fact, that here you cannot make any solution of any problem. You simply create problems. That you will do very easily. But to make a solution, that is not good. Your so-called civilization, science and advancement will simply create problems, and you will suffer.

That is their defect. They cannot understand that "We are simply creating problems in the name of advancement." Our Siddha-svarūpa was telling that the Hawaiians, they don’t want this American life of material happiness. They don't want. And they are being forced to accept this type of civilization, and they will realize. They want open field, agriculture. They welcome, a simple host, and their civilization, their mode of life has been killed by these Americans. They are very unhappy, but they are powerless. They do not like this. Nobody likes. I also personally do not like it. I come for preaching, not for enjoyment. But I do not like this very much. And this is not happiness, what is happening here. Everything. They do not get fresh food. First thing is eating. Everybody is eating all stale, tasteless, rotten, decomposed. You cannot get anything fresh. You cannot. But this stale food, keeping in the refrigerator for three hundred years, they like it. How they have become a downtrodden or fallen, even in their taste! Leftover, they keep it in the refrigerator, and after one week they can eat.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Chinese food.

**Prabhupada:**
Less than the animals.

[long pause] Which is very good, making material advancement, that’s all right, but why should you not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness? This is a good certificate we have got from some very authoritative person, that we are turning these drug-addicted hippies into the servant of Kṛṣṇa and the humanity. Is it not a good certificate?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes. It’s true.

**Prabhupada:**
Huh? And that’s the fact.

**Govinda dāsī:**
We were all hippies.

**Prabhupada:**
This is the fact. [laughs] And I came to America for this purpose. //Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo hari-nāme uddhārilo, tāra sākṣī jagāi mādhāi. Hari-nāme uddhārilo,// simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// Caitanya Mahaprabhu delivered all sinful men, suffering humanity. Is it? What is the evidence? //Tāra sākṣī jagāi mādhāi.// Just see, Jagāi and Mādhāi was drunkard. So I thought, "Why one Jagāi and Mādhāi? Why not hundreds and thousands of them, if //hari-nāma// has got so much power?" So actually it has done so. Now you also take it very seriously. //Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo hari-nāme uddhārilo.// You understand Bengali?

**Govinda dāsī:**
No, sorry. Maybe next time.

**Prabhupada:**
//Papi// means sinful, and //tapi// means suffering. So these two classes of men are there all over the world: sinful and suffering. As soon as one becomes sinful, he will suffer. So all these sinful and suffering beings were delivered simply by the method of //saṅkīrtana: hari-nāme uddhārilo. Tāra sākṣī jagāi mādhāi.// They would actually see Jagāi and Mādhāi, what they were and what they have become. Try to administer this.

So the first house, what is that place, Kaiva?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Ka’ava?

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Ka’ava?

**Prabhupada:**
Ka’ava.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Ka’ava. Where the rats were running?

**Prabhupada:**
Yes.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes, that was Ka’ava. That was the first house. That house is no longer there. They have bulldozed and made apartment buildings.

**Prabhupada:**
Oh. That was improvement. You have been there?

**Ambarīṣa:**
No.

**Prabhupada:**
Sudāmā. Sudāmā, Kārttikeya and... What was his name? [indistinct] [long pause] Your //tulasī// plant began from there, eh?

**Govinda dāsī:**
No, it began from McKinley Street, the other house where the temple was, where you installed the Pañca-tattva deities.

**Prabhupada:**
No, you tried there also.

**Govinda dāsī:**
I don’t remember. I was thinking of...

**Prabhupada:**
You planted.

**Govinda dāsī:**
I was thinking of it. I can’t remember. I got the seeds from a lady once, but they did not..., they didn’t grow. I got some seeds that didn’t grow. Now they’re everywhere.

**Ambarīṣa:**
On the other islands, too?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Oh, yeah.

**Prabhupada:**
Hmm?

**Govinda dāsī:**
They’re everywhere now.

**Prabhupada:**
Yes.

**Govinda dāsī:**
I went to the North Shore just recently to the hut where Siddha-svarūpa used to hold meetings, and there in the backyard I saw a huge //tulasī// plant, Kṛṣṇa //tulasī,// as big...

**Prabhupada:**
I saw in... What is that island?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Hawaii.

**Prabhupada:**
No, no. After Australia.

**Ambarīṣa:**
New Zealand?

**Prabhupada:**
No.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Fiji?

**Prabhupada:**
Fiji. Fiji.

**Govinda dāsī:**
On Fiji.

**Prabhupada:**
There also, they have got. The gentleman whose house I stayed, Mr. Punja. There were not so many, but one or two, very nice.

**Govinda dāsī:**
I’ve heard there are many Indians in Fiji.

**Prabhupada:**
Hmm?

**Govinda dāsī:**
I’ve heard there are many Indians in Fiji, many Indian people.

**Prabhupada:**
Yes. Almost there is majority Indians. And they are very wealthy. Fiji is very nice island, and it has got very, very good potency for spreading. Where have... where we have our temple. [long pause] Almost like Hawaii. That Perth... Parth or Perth, Australia? What is that?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Perth? Is it Perth?

**Prabhupada:**
Perth?

**Ambarīṣa:**
On the western side of Australia?

**Prabhupada:**
Yes.

**Ambarīṣa:**
The desert, like. As you come from India, you land at the first place?

**Prabhupada:**
Perth.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Perth, yes.

**Prabhupada:**
Although it is desert, it is not bad. There are many trees also. Where I was staying, that is full of trees. But it is warm.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupada:**
Many birds in the trees where I am staying. We have got now a very nice temple in Melbourne. First class.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Tuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupada:**
Huh?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Tuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa is...?

**Prabhupada:**
Tuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Is it Tuṣṭa Kṛṣṇa?

**Ambarīṣa:**
No.

**Prabhupada:**
No. Madhudviṣa. He has just organized. So Gaura-Nitāi, we can establish many temples, and simply chanting before Him and... [indistinct]. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair// [SB 11.5.32]: chant, dance and distribute //prasāda.// You don’t require even education. Simply before the Lord Nityānanda and Gaura, simply chant and dance. You will become the first-class advanced spiritual. It is so easy. Even if you are illiterate, you cannot read, you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, dance. That's all. Is it very difficult? [laughs] Everyone does it automatically. Even the child, you have seen how the small child takes part. He enjoys. He was not taught to stand and... Every children. What is their education? What is their spiritual education? They are offering flower. So nice movement. Even dogs take part, I have seen many times. They like the //saṅkīrtana.// That is a fact. The dogs also circling, and if anyone attempts to dance, "//Kaa-kaa...//"

**Govinda dāsī:**
I remember there was one dog in Ka’ava that was very fond of you. Each morning whenever you took your walk, there was one big dog, he would come.

**Prabhupada:**
Yes.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Do you remember?

**Prabhupada:**
Yes.

**Govinda dāsī:**
That dog disappeared soon after you left.

**Prabhupada:**
//Ācchā?//

**Govinda dāsī:**
He disappeared. And do you remember that one cat that used to run under your feet as you took your walk in the morning, that little cat that we had there?

**Prabhupada:**
Yes.

**Govinda dāsī:**
And you were always making fun that... Actually, I didn’t want it, but it had come there, you know. It died the night after you left. [laughs] So I think they took some better body.

**Prabhupada:**
And the dog disappeared?

**Govinda dāsī:**
The lady said her dog disappeared. She was crying, had a reward out. She was upset.

**Prabhupada:**
Oh, she was accusing us?

**Govinda dāsī:**
No, she wasn’t accusing us, it just disappeared. Maybe stolen, maybe ran away. It just disappeared, yes. The cat also. So I guess everyone is benefiting.

**Prabhupada:**
If it appeals to the small child, it appeals to the animals. Because the animal life and child life... There is no difference. They are the same. So we can understand, if it appeals to the child, small child, then it appeals to the animal also. That means all living entities, never mind he is animal, man or...

**Govinda dāsī:**
Until they are educated the wrong way.

**Prabhupada:**
Yes. That education, modern education, means to finish their brain. To make him more and more illiterate. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, //jaḍa-vidyā saba māyāra vaibhava.// This education is the expansion of //māyā.// How it helps us? There is no question of help. It binds you more and more in material life. You are already illusioned, and it will create more illusion, so that you will be bound up with the material life. //Anitya saṁsāre moha jīvake karaye gāḍha.// And if we say that "By this education you are becoming more and more like an ass," they will be very much angry. [long pause] Before Lord Caitanya, Nityānanda, if one simply chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, his life... He has nothing to do. So easy thing. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti,// he becomes the best brain. //Su-medhasaḥ:// his brain becomes clear from all hodge podge things. Everything is on the brain. Madman means on the brain. If the brain is cleansed, then where is the possibility of becoming madman? All these materialistic men, more or less, they are all mad, crazy, more or less.

[long pause]

**Govinda dāsī:**
Have you heard anything from Gaurasundara? Has he written you?

**Prabhupada:**
No.

**Govinda dāsī:**
He told me he wrote you one letter.

**Prabhupada:**
When?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Since the last time you came.

**Prabhupada:**
No.

**Govinda dāsī:**
You didn’t receive. I remember you wrote him a letter and asked him to come?

**Prabhupada:**
Yes, that...

**Govinda dāsī:**
He said that he received it the day after you left. And then he said he wrote you a letter. You didn’t receive?

**Prabhupada:**
No, I did not receive it. Call Paramahaṁsa. Where is Paramahaṁsa?

**Govinda dāsī:**
Paramahaṁsa? [pause as Govinda dāsī goes to call Paramahaṁsa] I don’t understand Gaurasundara’s philosophy. It’s changing all the time, and it’s all [indistinct].

**Prabhupada:**
That I have told, they will simply change. They will never keep it.

**Govinda dāsī:**
It’s always changing. He says so many contradictory things, I’m just bewildered. I can’t pinpoint what..., you know. I know that most philosophies you can figure out what...

**Prabhupada:**
He is not philosopher; he is crazy.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes, that’s what I mean. Yes. You received my letter? The one...

**Prabhupada:**
Hmm?

**Govinda dāsī:**
You received that letter I wrote you?

**Prabhupada:**
Yes, I received something.

**Govinda dāsī:**
[indistinct].

**Prabhupada:**
Another letter?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
No.

**Prabhupada:**
Did you receive any letter from Gaurasundara?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
No. He wrote recently?

**Govinda dāsī:**
He wrote since the last time, you wrote that letter to him on the Big Island?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Yeah, the invitation.

**Govinda dāsī:**
He answered it. He said that he answered it.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Really? Where did he answer it to? Here?

**Govinda dāsī:**
I don’t know. I’ll ask him, but he said he did answer it. He said he wrote you a letter. Maybe he just told me that to pacify me.

**Prabhupada:**
If he wants to speak with me, he can write a letter and you can bring it when you go. Or you can post. Why the letter will not come if he has posted?

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Yeah, it would’ve come.

**Prabhupada:**
Nobody intercepted.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Especially if he sent it here it would have easily come, because they would know where we were. Manasvī is in contact.

**Prabhupada:**
We are getting a very nice place in Hyderabad.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Allahabad?

**Prabhupada:**
Hyderabad, where we were working.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Hyderabad.

**Prabhupada:**
Hyderabad it is midland, Madhya Pradesh. Central India. Almost central.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
South central.

**Prabhupada:**
South central. So, six hundred acres there. We are going to develop a farm. Very nice climate, warm. India, everywhere warm. Severe cold, northern India.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Some, yeah.

**Prabhupada:**
Otherwise, especially in Bengal, there is never. It is neither very hot.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
No.

**Prabhupada:**
Bombay also.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupada:**
In Bombay we have got huge property. It is worth now one //crore// rupees. And everyone is envious that we have got such a big property, and we have paid practically no price. They are envious. They are trying to harass us in so many ways. They [indistinct]. Everyone, they are envious how we got this nice property. Double like this, double, [indistinct]. This is two acres?

**Ambarīṣa:**
Yeah, two acres.

**Prabhupada:**
That is five acres, and all beautiful coconut tree, banana tree. Six buildings. Bombay, to get one apartment you require one //lakh// of rupees, and we have got six buildings. So the old tenants, they will not go, so I have construction of eight buildings, another big, big flat, so we can have more than five hundred devotees without any difficulty. I have got so many so much. Besides that, we are constructing other building. If you can develop your people, it will be source of very good income. [pause] That's all.

**Paramahaṁsa:**
That’s all?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, that’s all. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupada:**
Bombay we have got very nice place; Māyāpur very nice place. You have seen Māyāpur?

**Ambarīṣa:**
No. I've just come back.

**Prabhupada:**
In Māyāpur, Vṛndāvana, our building is the tallest.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
[aside] It’s okay?

**Prabhupada:**
Ah. The governor stayed two days. Now perhaps we are going to have another good place, Kurukṣetra.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Kurukṣetra?

**Prabhupada:**
Where //Bhagavad-gītā// was spoken, personally. //Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]. This is the first word of //Bhagavad-gītā.// That Kurukṣetra. [end]
