====== Morning Walk ======

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
...not making //kachorī?//

**Bali-mardana:**
You have not asked for it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, I have to ask for it? [laughter]

[break] He has made it like that. Planet with so many oceans and mountains that is floating in the air. The whole thing is working. And these rascals want to compete with Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
One...

**Prabhupāda:**
He believed in God. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. And he had made a replica. He had made a small replica of the universe with all the planets floating and so on. He had made a small replica, and it was sitting in his house. And his assistant came one day, his atheist assistant, he came and he says, "Oh, who has made this wonderful replica of the universe?" And Sir Isaac Newton, who was sitting there reading, he says, "Oh, no one." And the man said, "What do you mean, no one?" He says... He didn't look up. He just says, "No one made it." And he kept reading, and the guy, the assistant, the atheist, he became very perturbed. He kept saying, "What do you mean, you fool? Obviously somebody made it. He must have great intelligence, and I'd like to meet the fellow who created this." And Sir Isaac Newton put down his book and says, "My friend, this is but a small replica of the universe, and you're the one who is always declaring that no one has created the universe. And now you're declaring to me that somebody must have created that. I'm saying it just happened, but you don't believe me. So how can I accept your logic when you say that all of this just happened?" [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...temple is very nice. [break] ...is also very nice.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...lunchtime.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. [break] ...the location also. That's a very good location they have, on the main road.

**Prabhupāda:**
Japanese?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yeah. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...injunction, //apāṇi-pado javano grahīta// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 3.19], is, "He, the God, has no leg, no hand, but He accepts gift." That"accept gift" means He has got hand, but why it is said "no leg," "no hand"? That means He has no material hand and leg. He has His hands and legs, but that is spiritual. That is the meaning. //Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. His body is made of spiritual eternity... This body is not eternal, but God has got His eternal body. There is no question of God's becoming old, because His body is eternal. It is the material body which is not eternal. That is subjected to old age, disease, birth, death. [//japa//] What is this big house? [break] ...stated that he came to cheat the atheists. They did not believe in God, but God came as Buddha.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And he said, "Yes, you are right. There is no God."

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
"Worship me." [laughs] Yes, I'm pretty sure I mentioned that. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They were satisfied, "Yes, we shall worship you." [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
The so-called more advanced ones, the teachers, the leaders, the monks, they have a more difficult time because they are..., have actually further studied the impersonalist philosophy, so they are more contaminated, whereas the congregation in general, they just, they don't take very seriously the philosophy. They don't get too deeply into it, I don't think. They just like to go to the temple and offer some incense to Lord Buddha and... [break] ...Govinda Restaurant, hungry...

[break] [on walk]

**Prabhupāda:**
...chanting, dancing. So this will rectify his philosophy. [break] He is so strong, it will send all philosophy to hell. [laughter] //Vijāyate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. [break] You will come out triumphant of all others. [break] Actually that is happening. What we are doing? We are not playing any magic. How this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is increasing?

**Manasvī:**
Yesterday I read in the newspaper that Indira Gandhi has been asked to step down from the prime ministership.

**Prabhupāda:**
I heard it. Where is that paper?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yeah, so this morning you get a paper, okay?

**Manasvī:**
I'll try to get a paper. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...body comes in her place, he will be another.

**Manasvī:**
Yes. [break] ...to step down, she's going to defy the court order.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They never want to step down.

**Prabhupāda:**
Like Nixon, like Nixon. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They are junk tours from Japan. [break] ...finding security in his radio.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that security?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
It's false security. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
And there was no necessity. Still, we shall go. It is very pleasant. [break] One umbrella, if you push, it will open, and if you push down, it will come back. Machine. [break] //...mantra// is described in the //śāstra// just like a potential medicine. If you take it, either you know it or non know it, it will act. And another example is given: Just like fire. If one, the father knows, "This is fire," and throws to the grass, it will be burned; similarly, if a child---he does not know what it is---if he throws, then that will also burn. [break]

**Ambarīṣa:**
I won't become involved in any other project besides Kurukṣetra? Just Kurukṣetra.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Ambarīṣa:**
//Jaya,// okay. Not even New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
New York is still doubtful.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
But that's a good house, New York?

**Ambarīṣa:**
The one that they have, or the one that they're trying to buy? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They are trying to buy. Did he send them letter by lawyer?

**Ambarīṣa:**
No, I haven't... No, my lawyer called... [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Well, the surf is no good today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break] ...another duplicate Pacific?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
I don't think so.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is it not possible?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
No, but they're trying to ruin the one that already exists.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] That also not possible. [break] ...let them drop this atom bomb and ruin it.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Break it, yeah? They will break it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...ship? What is that?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
It's a buoy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break] Is there any fruit?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, there's a fruit. It's fairly nice, but... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...date.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yeah, the birds... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...is very nice.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Oh. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...movement, then that is nice.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. They, the mystic //yogīs...// [break] Sailboat. [break] ...Cambodia and Vietnam. Now Cambodia and Vietnam are fighting.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?// Why?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Over the oil on the offshore. There is offshore oil. The want oil that the United Stated wanted... Now these two are fighting off some islands that are... There's a wars... Wars are... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply rogues. [break] There is light engaged. [break] [end]
