====== Room Conversation ======

**Devotee:**
//Japa// time [chanting in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Devotee:**
Chanting japa.

**Prabhupāda:**
So just you are seeing advertising on the road, telephone company. If you have got some problem do not hesitate to call. So what is the problem? What is your problem?...You cannot say anyone? What is your problem. Of course that is especially for the devotees. But the common man what is the problem?

**Devotee:**
Death, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mm?

**Devotee:**
Death, ...birth death old age.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes... Death, Nobody wants to die, that's a fact. They are manufacturing medicine. So many preventive processes to check death, old age, disease. These are the problems but where is the solution? The telephone company advertises, but is there any solution of this problem in this material world, by the material scientists? Try to understand this fact, they can give you facility and may bluff you that this is the solution. But the real problem remains the same. You should always keep in view that the material scientist, leaders they cannot solve the real problem. That real problem can be solved by Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. Try to understand this. If you have any questions you can ask?

This is our challenge. It is not challenge it is fact. They can challenge whatever they like but [indistinct], but these problems. No telephone company can give us information for that how these problems can be solved. This is our problem we don't want to die. Can you give me any information? They'll not hear but you can inform the telephone company that here is an institution which can solve it.

If we keep our problem always in conscious. They will give us facilities like the Karāndhara has told us that they have manufactured aeroplanes that can run at...what is that 14? 14 hundred miles an hour. So one can come from Paris to Los Angeles in two hours. But that is not solution of our problems that is increasing another problem and the Government is objecting that such planes are running then there will be so much catastrophe. The living conditions, that is creating another problem. And another problem means death, ultimately death. All problems are summarized into death

> mṛtyuḥ sarvaharaś cāham 
> [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]

//Mṛtyuḥ, mṛtyuḥ// death takes from us everything finished. Your... all arrangements for solving problems are taken away. Many leaders came within this world, Hitler, Churchill, Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, everyone tries to, Lenin, solve this problem, the problems are there but they left defeat. People may say that your this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement also will not solve the problems for everyone. But that is not the fact, the fact is whoever will take it seriously his problems will be solved. If everyone takes it seriously then every ones problems will be solved.

//Bhāgavat,// now we are publishing with original verse, transliteration word to word meaning. Not for selling, this for you. We are taking so much trouble for translating, giving word to word meaning trying to explain. Not that we are doing all this things for doing some good business. It is not meant for business it is really meant for our students. So if you find out time to study each and every //śloka,// what is the difficulty? Hm? Is there any difficulty? [Indistinct] So this...always engaged. Always engaged we have got sufficient engagement reading, distributing, chanting, //saṅkīrtan.// If you reduce the eating, sleeping, mating, that is spiritual life. The more you reduce the animal part of us. This is animal part, eating sleeping mating and defending. This is animal part but the human part of life is to develop your dormant Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. This is the chance, human life is the chance. Greater intelligence is human, to develop your human part of life, not to develop your animal part.

Then you are misusing, misuse. The modern civilization they are giving facility to develop animal part. Just like we saw in the beach, boy and girl they are lying in an open place embracing one after another. This is animal part of life. Just like dog they've no shame for sex life on the street. The human life is not meant for that we have got also sex life but not like that. But the modern civilization advancement means why not? [laughter] Just like... don’t laugh this serious. Just John Lennon he is standing naked. So they are thinking this is advancement of civilization, to increase the animal part of it, that is the defect of the modern... In spite of nice arrangement for education, or comfortable life, the tendency is to increase the animal part of it. You should know all this, you should not be captivated by this animal part. The human part of life is different, otherwise what is the difference between cats and dogs and hogs and human society? The human part of life is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, without Kṛṣṇa consciousness we are simply in the animal kingdom. Is that alright or if there any questions, you can ask them?

**Devotee:**
[Indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Certainly.

**Devotee:**
[Indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, provided they take it seriously. Otherwise if they keep their mentality differently then according to mind one has to get a body. But just like so many boys they come here in the beginning out of curiosity, but gradually they get the chance to become a devotee. Similarly if they take the chance then they will be liberated. They come out of curiosity but if they take it seriously then they will be liberated. Just like hospital is meant for curing the disease. So one should take the treatment if he simply goes and visits the hospital and thinks now I am cured how it can be. Hospital is .... suppose if I advertise that anyone who comes to this hospital he will be cured of his disease. That's a fact, but if he thinks that I have comes here, now I am going. Then how he will be cured?

You see Jaganātha on the //Ratha Yātrā,// his way for liberation is open. But if he comes back again and entangles himself... then? One goes to the doctor and he gives injection the disease is cured, but again he comes back and does the same thing so that he develops this disease again. So who's fault is it? This is called //hasti-snāna. Hasti-snāna// means, elephant takes bath very nicely and as soon as he comes on the bank of the river or the lake, he takes dust and throws [break] again. If we do that then we shall remain always dirty. We go take bath, clean but don't take dirt again. That is not going on. They become immediately //mukta,// liberated but they come, again become entangled. If it is a fact seeing Jaganātha is //mukta,// that how easy he comes to //mukta// but if he again comes to //māyā// then who can check it.

Just like we are following the path of liberation but if you again come back to //māyā// then where is your liberation? Why Jaganātha in the Ratha here but if somebody comes here and sees the path of liberation is open, now he should protect himself. Just like disease, fever it's subsided, now one should be careful not to relapse again. That care is in my hands, everyone’s hands and if you become prone to relapse again, then again the same thing. Just like in Christian church they confess for that is injunction. That's alright after confessing the sins are excused. That's a fact, but if he comes back, again commits the sin, then what is the account? But they are happy in that way. Then after one week you can go to the church, "And confess my sins". Then everything will be neutralized. This is alright, suppose on Sunday you become free from all contamination of your sins. On Monday, you again do the same thing so you become again become contaminated and say on Tuesday you should die then you are dying with sin. Is it not? Then what is your condition? If God or Christ excuses of your sinful life that's alright but when you come back you don't commit again sin then you are alright.

But we are taking it as a business, that we go on Sunday naturalize all sins and come back again and do the same thing. So from logical point of view, suppose you do the same sinful activity and if you die immediately then you'll die with sinful activities and go to hell. What benefit is derived by confessing in the church? This business is going on. Now I have seen Jaganātha my liberation is guaranteed now I can do anything. This mentality, this mentality is not really nice. You have seen Jaganātha your sinful activities are now neutralized but don't commit again. Now make progress then your liberation will be there, is it clear?

> nāmno balād yasya hi pāpabuddhiḥ

The chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa Mantra, once chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa is sufficient to make us pure from all sinful activities reaction. But if we commit sin again in the hope that because I'm chanting this will be neutralized and that is the greatest sin. So one side you should chant always Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra so that you may not fall down and other side you should be careful. No illicit sex life, no intoxication, no meat eating, in this way if you carefully make progress then your liberation is guaranteed. Just like doctor, if you go to a doctor for treatment of the disease he gives you medicine. At the same time he prohibits you, don't do this. So you take medicine and don't do this, follow these instructions, you are cured, yes. But if you don't follow the don't do this and don't take the medicine regularly then how you can expect cure?

It maybe but it will take long time but if you want quick, take it seriously. Just like Dhruva Māhāraja in six months he saw God. In six months.... [indistinct]. He followed self-realization and if you don't follow the regulative principles and instruction then our liberation will be delayed. Otherwise it's guaranteed.

**Devotee:**
How do you develop [indistinct]... knowledge.

**Prabhupāda:**
Seriousness, if you become serious then you will develop. Develop seriously, if you are fickle then how you can develop seriously. Therefore the injunction is

> yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo 
> [Śrī Śrī Gurvaṣṭaka]

we should be very serious to abide by the orders of the Spiritual Master then you are serious. If you think the spiritual master is a man like me why should I follow [indistinct]... the instructions so strictly, then you are not serious. And what is the use of your being initiated? This is seriousness and we are singing daily //yasya prasādād bhagavat prasādo,// what is the meaning of this?

**Devotee:**
By the mercy of the Spiritual master one receives the mercy of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if you don't follow the spiritual master then how can you get His mercy? Mercy is always there but if you don't take it? Then what [indistinct] Spiritual master or the father will do? You have to take it. That is civilization, therefore Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura says that the order of my spiritual master is my life. I do not know whether I get liberation or not that is not my business. My business is to carry out the order of my spiritual master, Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. If one is serious on this point then he is liberated. First of all we have to approach a spiritual master, who is actually spiritual master and then if he carries the order of the spiritual master then everything [indistinct]. The same example first of all you find out a right physician and you put yourself under his treatment, follow his instruction and the disease is cured. But if you go to your false Physician or if you are false, then you become implicated. [Indistinct].

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] 45 minutes.

**Prabhupāda:**
I shall go. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
