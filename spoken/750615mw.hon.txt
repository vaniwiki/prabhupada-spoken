====== Morning Walk ======

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
They understood. Because when Kaṁsa was baffled in killing the children of his sister, he regretted that "I have killed so many children of you, my dear sister. I am awaiting the most abominable hellish conditions." He admitted. [break]

**Ambarīṣa:**
...don't know what good and bad is. They think if you don't kill anybody that you will go to heaven. I mean any human being.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
But they think that this is only one? They do accept that there's life after this life and that they will live either in heavenly planets...

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise, what is the meaning of going to God? They believe it.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is, the Bible says, "Come to kingdom of God"?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if you have no next life, how you are going to there?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. They accept another life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then that is... Another life means soul.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have no clear knowledge. That is their... [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They are called Mormons. They have very big temples. They build very big temples still.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Is there any Deity?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They don't let anyone in the temple. It is for secret membership... It is for the... Only if you become a secret member, or something. I do not know what they have in there. I think what they have in there is copies of their scripture that were on golden...

**Ambarīṣa:**
Book of Mormon.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
The Book of Mormon is written on golden plates.

**Ambarīṣa:**
They have a gold Jesus deity.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They do. They worship Jesus. But they clearly accept that one..., that the person is separate from his body, the soul is different than the body; that we are not flesh, that we are spirit.

**Ambarīṣa:**
They have very strict disciplines too.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
And they accept that God is a person, that Jesus is the son of the Supreme Person. They even use the word "Supreme Person," "Supreme Personality." So in that way they are in conflict with...

**Prabhupāda:**
That God is separate from Jesus?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, that He is the father of Jesus. They make long arguments to show their point, that God is one with Jesus as father and son, not as two persons; the same person. And they also have fairly strict... They have strict principles, but the people don't follow them very well.

**Ambarīṣa:**
A lot of the young people do. Like I live around Salt Lake, and there's a lot of Mormons there, and there's a lot that... [break]

[on walk]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...that we can become creators of a universe and be in charge of our own universe. They are hopeful for that. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...in //Bhāgavata// also, that after passing one hundred life of first-class //karmī// one can become Brahmā. And after becoming Brahmā, he goes directly back to home, back to Godhead. [break] ...this dissolution, Brahmā hasn't got to die. By the same body he goes. [break] All the inhabitants of Brahmaloka, they also go with Brahmā. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...have sex outside of marriage, any of these activities. And they're not supposed to eat meat unless it's in time of famine or absolute necessity. They have a whole city, it's called Salt Lake City, Utaḥ, that's all practically their followers.[break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Go this side [break]

[in car]

**Ambarīṣa:**
In Salt Lake City they don't have bars.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
There's no bars in the city of Salt Lake. There's no drinking establishments or pornographic movies and these things.

**Prabhupāda:**
So when they started?

**Ambarīṣa:**
About eighteen something?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
About 150 years ago or 125 years ago, I believe. Isn't it? A hundred years ago.

**Ambarīṣa:**
I don't know when they found those documents. A lot of them are still secret. They won't... A lot of them are, like, books about what's going to happen in the future, and they keep them secret. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...system of having more than one wife, that a holy person or religious man had the duty to take on and give protection to more than one woman because there weren't enough righteous men and there were more women that needed protection than there were righteous men. So if there was a righteous man, it was his duty to protect more than one wife. But nowadays I think they are having some trouble keeping that in the United States. That is one thing the Christians became very... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...preach.

**Devotee:**
Yes, that's... [break]

**Ambarīṣa:**
Bali and I were discussing that the other day, Bali-mardana and I. Maybe when I come back here to live, maybe after Christmas, he and I, we'll see if we can work out... He knows some people that are in the movie business.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Which actors? Actors.

**Prabhupāda:**
Actors, we shall play. They haven't got to pay for us.

**Ambarīṣa:**
He was thinking also maybe to make it an epic picture of //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
That would be most popular, I believe.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Kṛṣṇa-līlā// also. That will be also popular. From //Bhāgavatam// we can have so many.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Endless.

**Ambarīṣa:**
They could be run on TV, too.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Have a series. [break] ...not to continue or to make any impression. And that will necessitate very good acting, not slapstick comedy. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
... they are not professional.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
So that... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...men can be trained up---that is possible---to play. We require professional director. Money may be spent by the movie company. And we give our men an idea. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...always looking for new movies, new ideas, the companies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Sam made many great religious pictures, big epics about Jesus and stuff like that. So maybe they would be open to the idea of doing the //Bhagavad-gītā.// That would be nice. Hare Kṛṣṇa [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
I mentioned to you something about making a movie of //Bhagavad-gītā.// You said it would be very difficult to find fifty thousand elephants. [laughs] There will be some...

[break] //...Kṛṣṇa-līlā// will be easier. He can be fighting one demon or dancing with the //gopīs. Bhagavad-gītā// is... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...do not understand the existence of soul, then why do they say "my head," "my hand"? Why not say "I head"? What is their answer? Why do you say "my head"?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They have no answer. [break] ...very much to know about this.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the folly.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Their desire is to enjoy the world and have religion to help them.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not the question of religion. Unless one understands, then he does not understand the transmigration of the soul. [end]
