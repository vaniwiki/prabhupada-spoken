====== Morning Walk ======

**Devotee (1):**
Yes, we have jackfruit. Big fruit.

**Bali-mardana:**
They do not know how to eat it, mostly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bring. I shall show you. [laughter] Yes.

**Devotee (1):**
We'll look. I will find.

**Bali-mardana:**
I have seen them selling sometime in private market, but I don't know if we can get it in the public market.

**Devotee (1):**
I've never seen it in a public market.

**Bali-mardana:**
They didn't sell it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
You can have some jackfruit tree.

**Devotee (1):**
On the land, on the property. Okay. Okay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. [break] ...nutritive and very sweet.

**Devotee (1):**
Very sweet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes. When it is ripe, it is very sweet. And when it is not ripe, it is called "vegetable meat."

**Devotee:**
"Tree goat."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...you prepare, it is better than meat. [break]

**Devotee (1):**
...the seeds.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, big, big seeds. That is also very digestive. If you make it powder, it acts like, what is called, pancreas.

**Devotee (1):**
Pan...

**Prabhupāda:**
Pancreas.

**Devotee (1):**
Oh, pancreas.

**Bali-mardana:**
I think you once told a story about an Englishman who wanted to taste jackfruit.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...tree, jam. It is berry, but blue.

**Devotee (1):**
They call it java plum? It's a very... It's bitter fruit? Is it very bitter?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not bitter. It is sour, little sour.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They makes a blue stain?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You have got?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Many here, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's very good. That is very good for diabetic patient.

**Devotee (1):**
Should we plant one on the land too?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. [break] It is called...

**Manasvī:**
//Kalajam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kalajam,// yes. [break]... is good medicine for diabetes. [break] ...houses are all fire-proof, eh?

**Devotee (1):**
That's what they say, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
No, they're not fire-proof. No.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they are concrete. There is no framework.

**Bali-mardana:**
There is no wood.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Then how is it they had a fire in one? They had a fire in one recently.

**Bali-mardana:**
Sometimes a fire starts in the kitchen or...

**Prabhupāda:**
Kitchen, yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Because there's gas. And the furniture...

**Prabhupāda:**
Not in the house. Wooden houses, they are just like matchbox. [break] ...Australia, they like cottage house. They don't like this skyscraper.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yeah, they like brick house, many brick houses, spread out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Small, one-storied. They are aristocratic. They do not go to the skyscraper, common man.

**Bali-mardana:**
They like the idea of one house.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is good idea. That is Indian idea. [break]

**Devotee (2):**
...front on the hedges, all those hedges in the front? They produce this flower.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice. Very good. //Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca// [[books:bg:7:9|[Bg. 7.9]]]. As soon as such fragrance, one should remember Kṛṣṇa: "This is Kṛṣṇa." //Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.// [break] Where is that scientist? Just like from the earth we are getting so many varieties of flavor and taste. The fruits are different taste, the flowers different fragrance, but wherefrom it is coming? From the earth. So why the scientists do not take all these things from the earth?

**Bali-mardana:**
All they do is create smog.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Bali-mardana:**
They create smog. Kṛṣṇa creates fragrant flowers.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, smog is also created by Kṛṣṇa. That's all right. I mean to say in the ground everything is there, the flavor.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
So why they can't put it together?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, why they cannot, by scientific, chemical or physical way, they cannot take the flavor from the earth?

**Bali-mardana:**
They do make synthetic scents.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They come out synthetic, though; they do not smell the same.

**Bali-mardana:**
Not as good.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Actually they make perfumes from flowers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Flowers, yes. That is... But not you take some dirt and extract the flavor. Then I will know that you are scientist. [laughter] [break] ...the vast water, but they cannot make it sweet. That you will have to depend on God. The water is, actually is taken, and it is made sweet. So how they can deny the hand of God?

**Harikeśa:**
They have some water distillation plants now.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is nonsense. He may distill one pound of water. That does not mean that... Why they are unnecessarily proud, and denying the authority of God? How foolish they are. Therefore I don't like them. The most heinous type of atheist; not gentlemen. [break] Whenever they hold some conference they say, "Don't talk of God. Then you cannot come to the conference." Do they not? What is that principle?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, yes, they do that. There was a conference on biology and evolution, and they made a rule at the beginning of the conference that "Whatever we discuss from now on is all right, except that we will not discuss about God or anything, any divine factor of creation."

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see how much atheist they are. Shameless atheist. Other atheists, they have got some shame. But these people are shameless. Shameless.

**Bali-mardana:**
"Because we cannot see God in our laboratory, therefore we will not discuss Him."

**Prabhupāda:**
But why do you teach us? We do not see whatever you say. We do not, so why do you place upon us? If seeing is evidence, that we don't see what nonsense you are talking.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
We don't see their atoms. We don't see their sputniks flying and landing or anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you talk?

**Bali-mardana:**
They want to replace... The want to put themselves in the place of the supreme authority.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that's all right. If that is your reason, that you don't see God. But we don't see that you are going to the moon planet. Why you make us believe that you are going to moon planet?

**Harikeśa:**
They might also say that we don't have the eyes to see the atoms and things like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Then you take our formula. Why do you expect to see God with your eyes? That means they are shameless atheist. Other atheists, they have got little shame, but these people have no shame even. [break] //...ādhamāḥ,// lowest of the mankind, //māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.// [break] Where? The zoo?

**Bali-mardana:**
[referring to peacocks] They roam about freely. It's over there.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Vṛndāvana there are many. [break] //...kokila-haṁsa-sārasa-gaṇākīrṇe mayurākūle nānā-ratna-nibaddha-śrī-yukta-vṛndāvane.// [break] //...kṛṣṇam a...//

**Harikeśa:**
//Ahar-niśam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Rādhā-kṛṣṇam ahar-niśam...// Yes. //Ahar-niśaṁ bhajatau...// Hmm? What is the next?

**Harikeśa:**
//Jīvārthau mudā... Rādhā-kṛṣṇam ahar-niśam...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//...bhajatau...//

**Harikeśa:**
//Jīvārthau mudā...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//...kīrṇe mayurākūle, nānā-ratna-nibaddha-śreṇī-śrī-yukta-vṛndāvane, rādhā-kṛṣṇam ahar-niśaṁ bhajatau...//

**Harikeśa:**
//...prabhajatau.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.// [break] ...mountains are creation of volcanic eruption?

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...crater there. Inside there is a crater.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break] ...problem is, at the present moment, they have exhausted all their intellect. Now they are finding out how to bluff the people and maintain themselves. That is their problem. Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes. The people have lost faith in the science because they have not produced anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the problem. Because they have cheated people for so many years and drawn high salaries, now they are finding out "How to cheat these rascals and continue our business?" This is the problem. Because they have nothing to research. Everything, whatever, are finished. And all failure. Simply big, big words, that's all. Word jugglery, that's all. They could not do anything. What exactly they have done, something which is not done by God? They competition with God, so what they have done? What is their contribution?

**Bali-mardana:**
Only negative; nothing positive. [break] ...easier to kill people.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it. That much they have done, yes. [break] ...diverting the attention of the people from going to the moon planet, they are meeting in the sky. So what will benefit we shall derive by their meeting in the sky?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They have people now that are. They have scientists now that are proposing, and they have grants on how to develop a city in outer space or on the moon. They already have it how they're going to send people, how they're going to get their...

**Prabhupāda:**
This is another bluff. You see? And these rascals are believing them.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Especially they're making..., trying to make people feel that their problems will be solved, that when it gets too bad they'll just be able to go to the moon. So there's no real problem even if you ruin the earth, because you can always escape.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that mean... What about their moon planet going? That is stopped?

**Ambarīṣa:**
Going to the moon?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
I don't think they're sending any more rockets to the moon.

**Ambarīṣa:**
Yes, they're finished now. There's too much litter up there.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, useless. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...a campaign that...

**Prabhupāda:**
That will take place. Otherwise, how they will be killed?

**Ambarīṣa:**
They're calling it a limited nuclear war.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are accumulated with so much sinful load that must be killed. That is sure. [break] ...the massacre. That will take place.

**Harikeśa:**
The sinless people will survive?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (3):**
Who is that?

**Prabhupāda:**
We. [laughter] [break] There was an artificial famine in India, and I particularly inquired from all devotees whether they have got any problem in this famine. They said, "No, we have no problem." I have taken the statistics. In 1942 the artificial famine created by government... So there were big earthquake in Bihar. At that time one of my Godbrother, he was government auditor. So I inquired. In that earthquake only his house was saved. I have seen it many times. //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. That is the only...

> samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavaṁ
> mahat-padaṁ puṇya-yaśo murāreḥ
> bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padaṁ paraṁ padaṁ
> padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām
> [SB 10.14.58]

//Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām.// It is not meant for them, all these dangerous condition. Now the nuclear war means it will not continue very long. The first party who will drop the bomb on the other party, he will be victorious, and immediately the war will stop. They are simply arranging how to drop the atom bomb first. So one who will be able to drop the bomb first, he will be victorious. It doesn't require long time. Just like in Japan, as soon as the Americans dropped the atom bomb in Hiroshima, immediately they surrendered. This will be the result. Now the question is who will be able to drop the bomb first.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
The Japanese didn't have any atom bombs to send back, though.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. It was in possession of Hitler. And your American stolen and kept it. Hitler wanted to use it, but, good sense, he did not like. He said that "I can do it immediately, but I will not do it." So three bombs they kept ready, and when Germany was in awkward condition these Americans, they stolen, and they used it in Japan. This was manufactured by the German.

**Bali-mardana:**
Most of the American scientific knowledge for going to space, etc., is all gotten from the Germans.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bali-mardana:**
They stole the German scientists. And the Russians also, after the war, they took many German scientists.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think the aeroplane was made by the Germans first.

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, the jet airplane, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And they took it, the idea, from Sanskrit literature. Yes. They purchased the book from Benares.

**Manasvī:**
In India we have, and Hawaii, the firecrackers going up, the idea was from there.

**Harikeśa:**
The Germans also had the idea that this universe is encaged in some hard layers. And they were trying to bounce waves off of the edge of the universe.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, the Germans, they very much praised Indian culture. That my Godbrother Schulze[?], when he came to India he said that "When Indian students come to our country, first of all we inquire how much he has got asset of his own culture. If we find that he has got some knowledge in his own culture, then we receive. Otherwise we reject." As soon as they found that somebody is made of London culture, then immediately they reject. There are many Sanskrit scholars in Germany.

**Harikeśa:**
All of the good dictionaries are from Germany.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Max Mueller was German.

**Harikeśa:**
A lot of the devotees have been wondering about book production if there is some war.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Harikeśa:**
A lot of us at the Press have been wondering about book production if there is some war.

**Prabhupāda:**
War? The war will be for a few days only.

**Bali-mardana:**
Then the presses can go on.

**Prabhupāda:**
This war will not prolong. That is not possible.

**Harikeśa:**
So this is not the big one.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is big war, but it will be finished within short time.

**Bali-mardana:**
Drop their bombs, everything's finished.

**Upendra:**
But the argument is that these bombs will create more disturbance than just the blowing up. They create what's called radio-active fallout.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that will do. But the war will stop because the party which will be able to drop the bomb first, he will be victorious.

**Upendra:**
They've got these fancy...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then after effects, what will happen, that is another thing. But the war will not continue for ten years or five years, like that.

**Bali-mardana:**
Many Communist countries now, they are not making any more big cities. They are keeping the population very spread out so that after the war they will be able to take over. Because if one has a big city, then the people can be killed very easily in one bomb, finished. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...they are afraid of death.

**Bali-mardana:**
Well, the Chinese figure they have so many people that even if there is a war...

**Prabhupāda:**
They are gainer.

**Bali-mardana:**
...there will still be so many of them left. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...they will be left. [break] //Harer nāma harer nāma// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. [break] ...Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don't bother. [break]

[in car] ...statistics of hitchhike. What is called, hitchhike?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Hitchhikers.

**Prabhupāda:**
So mostly rape cases.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, because they don't want to make a different... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...call it [indistinct] [break] ...America can drop the first bomb in Moscow, then they will come out triumphant. And the Communists will be finished. [break] ...friendship with Pakistan only for this reason. It is just on the border of Russia. If from Pakistan they can drop the first bomb in Moscow. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...in the United States and Russia are to get on special airplanes that are equipped... It's like a city in the air, where they will be able to wage war from the air so that even if the all the cities are destroyed, they will still be able to make strategy and keep sending missiles with warheads, because they have so many missiles with warheads all over the country that even if all the cities are wiped out they can keep sending more. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...they will get their food?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
They have it so that they have something like a year's supply. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They are struggling for living. Still, they will not be allowed to live.

[break] ...Communists.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes, well they have some basic differences, in philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is their philosophy?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
The Chinese say that the Russians are revisionists, that is that they're actually capitalists, and the Russians say that the Chinese are religionists, that they're not..., that there's some stuff they're following alongside with their... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...spiritualists?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Most of the Russians are on a grosser bas... [break] [end]
