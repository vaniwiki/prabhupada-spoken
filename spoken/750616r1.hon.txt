====== Room Conversation with Govinda Dāsī ======

**Govinda dāsī:**
[describing illustrations] ...because the co-wife complains. And so Dhruva is very upset and goes to his mother, and his mother is real upset, and she's crying. And so she takes him on her lap, and she tells him about Lord Viṣṇu, that He's the only solace. And so Dhruva leaves home. He leaves the palace immediately and goes to the forest to search out the Lord. And there he meets Nārada, who sees what's going on all this time. And Nārada tells him that he should take brahminical instructions, but Dhruva isn't able to, because he is determined as a //kṣatriya// boy. And so Nārada sits down and gives him instruction about Lord Viṣṇu and tells him to go to the forest, Madhuvana forest, and sit there in Vṛndāvana. And so Dhruva takes his instruction and goes there and sits in meditation in the forest. This will be Vṛndāvana in the background, and he sits there in meditation. In the meantime, King Uttānapāda is upset because he has offended his son, and so he is lamenting, and Nārada comes to him and tells him that "Your son's glories are already spread everywhere." So then Dhruva is perfecting his meditation in the later stages and standing on one toe and pressing down on earth planet, and all of the universe is becoming upset. I just studied your //Bhāgavata// and did from each //śloka.//

And so the demigods go and pray to the Lord at the Ocean of Milk. This would be like in the bubbles, because I know they can't see Him, but it would be like He's seen, but not clearly. And so they pray to the Lord, and the Lord tells them, "Don't worry. I shall do something. " And so the Lord comes to Dhruva, who is in full meditation, and Dhruva, all of a sudden, he doesn't see the Lord, and he opens his eyes because he's upset, and he sees the Lord before him and falls down at His lotus feet. And then, because he's just a child, he doesn't have any knowledge of how to offer prayers, so the Lord touches him with the conch, and he's blessed with the ability to offer prayers. So then he offers prayers, and I'm going to put some of the glories of Mahā-Viṣṇu here. And so he's offering prayers to the Lord. And this drawing is not yet transferred, but this is the Lord, who then benedicts Dhruva with the kingdom on the planet earth and then also the polestar, or his own planet. Then Dhruva... The Lord leaves on Garuḍa, and Dhruva watches Him go.

Then Dhruva begins to walk home, and he's lamenting, because despite having seen the Lord, he had material desires in his heart, and so he's in grief; he's lamenting. And so at this time a messenger comes to King Uttānapāda and tells the King that "Your son is coming," and so the King gives him a valuable garland and blesses him. And immediately he gets on his chariot with his horses and the two queens on a palanquin and leaves the palace looking for Dhruva. This is just sketched in; it's not finished. And so they see Dhruva entering a nearby forest, and they come down, and they all embrace him, and they're all very glad to see him come home. And then the King places Dhruva upon a big elephant, she-elephant-and I'm not sure if they have tusks or not---and he comes into the city, which is all decorated. And then the way I'm ending it is the King and Dhruva are sitting in one of the beautiful palace gardens, and the King is telling him how he will soon become king himself---Dhruva will soon become king when he grows a little older himself.

**Prabhupāda:**
When he..., when he became king, his brother was slain.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
He fought with the Yakṣas and killed them. He was a young man. Yes. It is very nice.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Do you like it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Mmm!

**Govinda dāsī:**
I mean, do you like the idea?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So you can make such picture book.

**Govinda dāsī:**
I just have to learn to work faster.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we can sell. You can make good income out of it.

**Devotee:**
She asked if a she-elephant, do they have tusks?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Devotee:**
Do the she-elephants have the tusks?

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know.

**Govinda dāsī:**
In the //Bhāgavata// it says that he's placed on a she-elephant, and I've never seen... I mean, I don't even know what they look like. So I will finish this book, but at the same time, since you've told me to do Deities now, I have to start making plans how to do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That you can do when this is finished.

**Govinda dāsī:**
Yes. I will finish this. I have not been able to get in contact with this boy Vṛṣṇi, who is the person who can help me with the Deities. And so I don't know. Formerly...

**Prabhupāda:**
So that is not in a hurry. So many are coming. You have very good engagement. You have got so many qualifications for Kṛṣṇa's service. Be engaged always in this work; you will never feel solitary. [pause]

**Govinda dāsī:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// [indistinct] [end]
