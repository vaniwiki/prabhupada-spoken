====== Morning Walk ======

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
This way is longer. You have more room to keep walking. That way you have to stop after awhile.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. [break] ...them something substantial. They are eager. This is the proper time. By nature the turn comes. [break] //...brahma-jijñāsā.// [break] "...drinking." "No dog." This is our principle. [break] "...smoking." [break] ...don't say anywhere, "No illicit sex." That is allowed. Go on with it. [break] Tomorrow we shall come for morning walk? No.

**Manasvī:**
You'll have to leave the temple about 8:00, before eight.

**Devotee:**
7:30

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
There's time. There's time to take a walk.

**Śrutakīrti:**
You would have to take massage in the morning, so I don't think there would be ample time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] Writing, advertising, "World famous...?"

**Devotee:**
"World famous steak and lobster." It's a restaurant.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
It's different advertisement. [break] Here it is not allowed, so the companies are going to use cars.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] ...the //samosā?//

**Manasvī:**
Lilānanda.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is very nice. Why don't you make it in the morning?

**Manasvī:**
For breakfast?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] //...khalu sarvataḥ syāt// [SB 11.9.29]. //Viṣaya// means sense enjoyment. Now, that boy and the girl, they're taking dogs. The dog is also male and female, and the man is male and female. So //viṣaya// means sense enjoyment. The sex enjoyment is both; the dogs and the man, they will have. But the man can get Kṛṣṇa; the dog cannot get Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference. //Viṣaya,// that sex enjoyment, is available both for the dogs and the man. But the man can achieve Kṛṣṇa; the dog cannot. That is special. //Viṣaya khalu sarvataḥ syāt.// [break] ...of eating, sleeping, mating. That is available in every life. [break] ...another passage is there in //Prema-vivarta, janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya:// "In every life, one can get father and mother." //Kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei:// "But Kṛṣṇa and //guru// cannot be had in every life." That is only in human life. Otherwise, as soon as there is birth, there is father and mother. Either you become human being or tiger or snake or bird, the father-mother is there. But the spiritual father and Kṛṣṇa, that can be obtained in human life, not in every life.

> janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya
> kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

So we should take full advantage of the human life. That is civilization. And in sense gratification it is not civilization; it is animal life. [break] ...for sense gratification. This is the modern civilization. [break] ...nice place is made for sense gratification. And as soon as you perform //kīrtana,// the police will harass you. This is civilization. [break] ...nice place, there should be so many temples. People will come early in the morning, take bath in the sea, go to the temple, have some spiritual inspiration. That program is there. And running. The dog is running and the man is running.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
In circles.

**Prabhupāda:**
This sense does not come, that "The dog is running; I am also running. Where is the difference between him and me? She has got a female mate; I have got a female mate. Where is the difference? How I am civilized?" That, this sense, do not come. [break] ...thinking, "I have chained the dog, but I am not chained." But you are chained by //māyā,// invisible chain. That he does not know. He is also chained. [break] //...māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. //Māyā-sukhāya.// [break] ...peacock? No, cranes, //sārasa.// [break] ...football? Football ground.

**Devotee:**
Soccer.

**Prabhupāda:**
Soccer or football?

**Manasvī:**
Football. That's football. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
No, rugby is different.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Football they call soccer here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...men in one party?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
I don't know.

**Manasvī:**
Eleven.

**Devotee:**
Did Kṛṣṇa play that? [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Unless Kṛṣṇa played, how you can play? [break] Football play is very popular in India, and rugby. What is that called, rugby?

**Manasvī:**
No, that is hockey.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hockey, hockey, yes. [break]

[in car]

**Upendra:**
...a recipe for these potato patties. What was that recipe again? Potatoes, and then you mentioned some...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sāgu-dhana.// [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
From observation and experience, I think that there's a higher rate of sickness in the temples than outside the temples, than in the normal population for some reason, and I was wondering what could be done to bring this down. Like I know every time I'm living in close quarters, for instance, here in the temple, I get some type of flu. And I can think of what it might be, but I think that in many of the temples, from what I've experienced, there seems to be more sickness. I don't know whether it's...

**Prabhupāda:**
For you or for all others?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Well, I know myself for sure. But I'm wondering... I see a lot of other people always... There seems to be epidemics always going around or something. Manasvī, what do you think in the Honolulu temple?

**Prabhupāda:**
Manasvī is not sick.

**Manasvī:**
No, there is not anything like flu or anything. Some of the devotees have, like, chronic diseases.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
But in general.

**Manasvī:**
I have rheumatism, you know. That is from the very beginning. Some people are like that.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
In general...

**Manasvī:**
Honolulu temple is not so sick. Once it happened about three months before. At that time I was told it was all over happening. But no, generally Honolulu temple, there is not much sickness. Once in a while we get... [break] [end]
