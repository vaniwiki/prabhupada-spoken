====== Arrival Conversation in Car & Room ======

[in car]

**Jayatīrtha:**
Now everything is very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
When you have come?

**Brahmānanda:**
I came Wednesday evening.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you look bright.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja, how is your preaching going on?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very well, Śrīla Prabhupāda, thank you. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Nice now. Yes. So Sudāmā is doing nice?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes, he seems to be. He gave a very nice lecture the other night. He seems to be very---how would you say it---repatriated. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...is behind. Why?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Well, now we are catching up. Now things are becoming much more organized. But at the end in New York, things were very disorganized, and nothing was getting done.

**Prabhupāda:**
Brahmānanda Mahārāja, you kindly inquire where is the bottleneck.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. From what I have seen already, they are doing much more than before.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. But still, you are behind so many books.

**Brahmānanda:**
They are giving one book now to the printer.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why there are seventeen books behind?

**Brahmānanda:**
Hayagrīva is today finished the sixth volume of //Madhya-līlā.// There are nine volumes altogether.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. I have heard that seventeen books are behind. Why? Very slow. You should rather want me to give more matter. But you are behind. What is the reason? Editorial department?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Now the editorial department is doing very good.

**Prabhupāda:**
But you are behind so many books.

**Jayatīrtha:**
The only thing which is a little slow now is the Bengali departments. But now, with Nitāi and Jagannātha coming, it should be...

**Prabhupāda:**
Bengali?

**Jayatīrtha:**
The Bengali editing is a little behind still. But the other departments are going at rate of two books a month. If we can now just bring the Bengali department...

**Prabhupāda:**
Books are not coming out.

**Jayatīrtha:**
No, because during the whole..., until they left New York, hardly anything was getting done, and then they went to India, the whole Press, so nothing was getting done, and then they moved. So now they've been here about three weeks. Since they've been here almost one whole book has been finished, and the rate has become very much increased.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhāgavatam,// Fifth Canto is finished, Sixth Canto half-finished.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Sixth Canto half-finished?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
That's very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have finished only Fourth Canto.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fifth Canto not yet published. So Haṁsadūta has sent some copies of xerox. At all universities they are giving standing order---Oxford University, London University. In London, I hear, England, they are also giving standing order for //Bhāgavatam// and //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.//

**Jayatīrtha:**
Oh, yes. That's a fact. Satsvarūpa is coming tonight.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Dr. Judah has written one very nice book. I have read it.

**Brahmānanda:**
Dr. Judah's book.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, I have read it. Did you like that book?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
He's coming here in four days to see you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is very scholarly written, and he has appreciated our...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I've met him many times. Every day we are performing the festival, //kīrtana.// He is very favorable.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's a good man. He has studied the movement very fairly. He is only surprised, "How these drug-addicted hippies have become devotee?" That is his surprise. He has mentioned that, that "We appreciate your movement, that you have turned so many drug-addicted hippies into devotee of Kṛṣṇa and in the service of humanity." That they are appreciating. And that is the fact. //Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. If one is turned into devotee, then all the good qualities automatically become manifest.

That is the verdict of //Bhāgavata. Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā.// Anyone who is not a devotee, his material qualification has no value. //Mano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ.// He is hovering over the mental plane. Therefore in your country, Western country, the so-called big, big philosophers, scientists, they could not do anything tangible, because they are hovering on the mental plane. [breaks squeal] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Manorathena. Mana// means mind, and //ratha// means car. They are driving on the mental car. So mind is material. [pause] Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja---selling more books?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja is selling the most books.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is collecting $30,000?

**Jayatīrtha:**
How much you are collecting, Tamāla, last month?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, we collected a lot.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The collection is very good. The books are selling.

**Prabhupāda:**
Selling amongst public or educational institution?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We are selling to all classes of people---big books and small books.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got now proper engagement.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I started by doing this.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes. No. You are feeling happy in this engagement.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, I'm happy to serve you, Prabhupāda. Whatever pleases you makes me happy. We are getting many new men. Now we have about 115 men.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, another bus? [chuckles]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, more and more buses.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Your country is full of buses. //Yasmin deśe yad ācaraḥ.// Your country is of motorcar, so take advantage of motorcar and utilize it for Kṛṣṇa. That is the tactics. Not that "Oh, we have become Vaiṣṇava. We don't touch motorcar. It is material." This is not our philosophy. //Nirbandhe kṛṣṇa sambandhe yukta-vairāgyam ucyate// [Rūpa Gosvāmī]. We can utilize everything in relationship with Kṛṣṇa because we see everything Kṛṣṇa's. If the motorcar is there, it is for Kṛṣṇa. That is our mission. Karāndhara came there.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Karāndhara came. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he said, "I am again surrendered." [laughs]

**Jayatīrtha:**
I hope so.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he has gone to Tehran?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes. A letter just came from him recently saying that he was very enthusiastic in his service there.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is business-minded. Let him do business for Kṛṣṇa.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes. He says there is so much money there they don't know how to spend it. In Iran people have so much money they don't what to do with it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They are getting money for nothing. [laughs]

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes. Right. It's coming out of the ground.

**Prabhupāda:**
And the Bengali saying, //dhula mati bhatte kare mata//[?]: "They are catching dust and it is turning into coin." This proverb is there, //dhula mati bhatte kare mato.// He is thinking that "I am taking some dust, but when it is in hand, it is coin." That is good time. And when it is bad time, if you catch coin and when it is in your hand, it is dust. We should think that time may also come. Yes. Because after all, it is Kṛṣṇa's desire, turn dust into coin, to turn coin into dust. So we should be always careful. If we remain Kṛṣṇa conscious, then the coin will never turn into dust. Otherwise it can be turned. So you American, you are now full of coins. Before turning into dust, catch Kṛṣṇa with the coin: it will never turn into dust; it will remain coin. Hmm? I am very hopeful of the Americans. Because you are so nice devotees, you can keep your country coinful, no dustful. India is giving up Kṛṣṇa, and therefore they are turning into dust.

**Jayatīrtha:**
So much dust.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The whole thing is being done by the mercy of your books, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, it is not my book; it is Kṛṣṇa's book. I am trying my best to present it as it is, that's all. That much you can say my, but there is nothing mine.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The effect of these books is hard to perceive immediately, because we can't imagine how... So many millions of books have gone out. In the future they will all fructify as devotees, the people who have read them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. When they will read, then they will get. Nowadays in the Sixth Canto, Fourth Chapter, the soul and how the soul is covered, that is being described wonderfully. //Śrīmad-bhāgavatam amalaṁ purāṇam// [SB 12.13.18]. //Vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām.// It is written by the most learned Vyāsadeva, //vidvāṁs,// and //sātvata-saṁhitām.// How merciful he was. He is still living, Vyāsadeva. He is still existing.

> bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje
> lokasya ajānataḥ vidvāṁś
> cakre sātvata...
> [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]

Do you remember this verse? It is in the First Canto.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
First Canto.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Anartha.// The soul has been embarrassed, the unnecessary things. Just like a man is within the huge garbage. What is his position? If... You have got your garbage car, so within that, [chuckles] if a man is pushed...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Abominable.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is like that. Twenty-four elements. Five material elements, three subtle elements, then five working senses and five all knowledge-gathering senses---how many?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Eighteen.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eighteen? No.

**Jayatīrtha:**
So far.

**Prabhupāda:**
Twenty-three, I think. Five gross elements, five senses..., five knowledge-gathering senses, and five working senses, fifteen...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Then the objects...

**Jayatīrtha:**
Three subtle...

**Prabhupāda:**
The mind, ego and //mahat-tattva,// eighteen, yes. And then five sense objects---the //rūpa, rasa,// form, taste, like that. Then twenty-three.

**Jayatīrtha:**
The aggregate, //pradhāna.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Pradhāna,// and then the soul, twenty-five. Twenty-four and three //guṇas.// Three //guṇas: sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// Twenty-seven. So twenty-seven layers of garbage. Underneath, the soul is there. What he will do? He is a small particle, soul, and he is covered with so many material elements. To come out of it is very, very difficult. But if one is engaged in devotional service he can come out immediately. Just like when one is spiritually perfect, he goes immediately to Kṛṣṇa, penetrating these material coverings of the universe. Immediately. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]], immediately. That is spiritual force.

So can you give me a list how much money you have to realize from our devotees who have taken money, loan?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Who have taken money in loan? You mean unauthorized loan?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not unauthorized, authorized.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Oh, how much Book Trust has loaned...

**Prabhupāda:**
Unauthorized also? There are?

**Jayatīrtha:**
How much Book Trust loans there are. You want to see the list of Book Trust loans?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes, we can give you that list.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is unauthorized loan also?

**Jayatīrtha:**
I thought you were... Sometimes in the past from time to time these things have gone on.

**Prabhupāda:**
Past is all right. Have you received any news from Bombay?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes, there's two letter from Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. Pālikā brought them. Pālikā has come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So what is the position there?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, I haven't read the letters yet, but she was saying that on the whole, Mr. Mhatre now is diminishing. They have met with his superior in the party, and the superior is very much..., he's not happy with Mr. Mhatre's activities and his reputation, and he says that in the forthcoming election he may not even put him on the election ballot.

**Prabhupāda:**
That will be right punishment for him. Then he will understand. That will be more than death. Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, for a politician, that's the worst.

**Prabhupāda:**
Politicians, if they are refused political seat, that is more than death. Just like Kṛṣṇa was advising Arjuna that "You are known as a great hero, and if you don't fight then they will blaspheme you like anything. So that will be more than death. Better die. When they will say //nindanti,// 'Oh, the Arjuna has become a coward. He could not fight. He will die,' so that blaspheme will be more than death." So by the grace of Kṛṣṇa it has come to the notice of the...

**Brahmānanda:**
The other party members, the party superiors, they are... His reputation is damaging their party.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
His activities are so unscrupulous.

**Prabhupāda:**
And what about the N.O.C.? N.O? No-Objection Certificate?

**Brahmānanda:**
I don't know the details, but Pālikā said that they are..., the holes have been dug and they're expecting to put the foundation in before the monsoon. And that there was some attempt to stop the some digging, but that has been defeated. When I was there, there was some question about getting the No-Objection Certificate for the already-existing temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Existing temple?

**Brahmānanda:**
Well, the little temple we have there now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Every year it has to be renewed.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yeah. So this year they have, by some trick, they have made it that the police must give their No-Objection Certificate. Usually that is not required each year.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are harassing us in so many ways. Only in Bombay.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That means if we become successful finally, it will be a tremendous success, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Something very big will happen there.

**Brahmānanda:**
They've concluded that the opposition is not from the central government but from the local. Because the projects are going on without being hampered in any other places in India. It is only in Bombay that we are getting this difficulty.

**Prabhupāda:**
In central government that Indira Gandhi is now...

**Brahmānanda:**
Her position is now jeopardized.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Really? I didn't know that.

**Prabhupāda:**
She is convicted.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Election fraud.

**Prabhupāda:**
That election was not properly...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who has convicted her?

**Brahmānanda:**
High court.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How was... I am surprised they could do that. She's practically like a dictator.

**Prabhupāda:**
And she has been done in his [her] own city, Allahabad.

**Brahmānanda:**
They have lost the election, Congress Party.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, this is a recent, new election.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes, in Gujarat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now our next attempt will be Kurukṣetra...

**Brahmānanda:**
There is some proposal there?

**Prabhupāda:**
...where Kṛṣṇa personally spoke //Bhagavad-gītā.// Recently I have been in Kurukṣetra. You were... Yes. So I have decided to do something there. Yes. Because Kṛṣṇa personally spoke there. Our two movements---we are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness on the basis of //Bhagavad-gītā// and we are holding Ratha-yātrā---all these two incidences took place at Kurukṣetra. Kurukṣetra is so important. Kṛṣṇa, Balarāma and His sister, on some occasion of lunar eclipse, they came from Dvārakā in a chariot, //ratha,// two brothers and sister, and that is the occasion of Ratha-yātrā. And the Vṛndāvana inhabitants, especially Rādhārāṇī, they came from Vṛndāvana to see Kṛṣṇa after long time. And she pleaded that "Kṛṣṇa, You are the same Kṛṣṇa, I am the same Rādhārāṇī..." [coughing] Is there any water? No. "But this place is not the proper place. Let Us go to Vṛndāvana." That is Mahāprabhu's feeling.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. You've expressed that in //Madhya-līlā,// throughout there.

**Prabhupāda:**
That Mahāprabhu's feeling of Kṛṣṇa is like that. Therefore He took part in the Ratha-yātrā and invited Kṛṣṇa, "Come to Vṛndāvana." So these two important things took place in the Kurukṣetra. So we must have a very big temple there, and a //varṇāśrama// college. This is my desire. Kṛṣṇa's direct instruction, //Bhagavad-gītā.// It should be a historical... It is historical. People should come here as the most important historical place. And //Gītā// is well known all over the world. And //Gītā// begins with the word //dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]. So Kurukṣetra, in that sense very important.

**Brahmānanda:**
That was one of the first things you told us when you came, that Kurukṣetra is an actual place. There's a railway station. People can go there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
We had never known that. We thought it was something mythological or...

**Jayatīrtha:**
Allegorical.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not. These political leaders, they have made it.

[reading sign:] Carpeterica. They manufacture carpet? We are already on the Venice road? No?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Yes. This is Venice Boulevard.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got my passbook?

**Jayatīrtha:**
From the Liberty Bank?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not Liberty. Bank of America?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Passbook.

**Prabhupāda:**
Investment passbook?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Oh, from that savings account.

**Prabhupāda:**
I sent it to be made..., for making it up to date.

**Jayatīrtha:**
You mailed it?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I gave to Gurukṛpa, and he sent through somebody.

**Jayatīrtha:**
He did not give it to me. Maybe he gave it to Rāmeśvara. I'll check with him. I think he must have forgotten.

**Prabhupāda:**
So the engineering block is now occupied?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Oh, yes. As we go by it, you can see the big sign is there, "Bhaktivedanta Book Trust." Just over here to the left. [devotees exclaim]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [laughs]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Nice. You have never seen...

**Prabhupāda:**
So that Bhaktivedanta go-down has come here? No.

**Jayatīrtha:**
No, go-down is still there. This building is not large enough for that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You have not seen this building yet, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, here is for lease. [Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and Jayatīrtha discuss in background about leasing one of the buildings for a restaurant] [break]

[in Prabhupāda's room]

**Prabhupāda:**
But when they live, the tendency is there. Naturally I want to love somebody. It is not unnatural. When that love is reposed to Kṛṣṇa, that is perfect. The Māyāvādī, they are frustrated; therefore they want to make this love into zero. They cannot understand Kṛṣṇa's love with //gopīs.// They think it is another edition of this material... Oh, how are you, Hayagrīva prabhu? How are you? You look better. You are looking better, brighter than when I saw you in New Vrindaban last. You have got so much talents for serving Kṛṣṇa. Everyone has got. That I am speaking. We have to utilize it. From the very beginning I met you, I instructed to edit. That was the starting of our //Back to Godhead.// [to the others] He is good typist also. You know that? [laughter] I think he is the best of all of our men. He can type very swiftly and correctly. I think in our group Hayagrīva prabhu and Satsvarūpa Mahārāja are very good typist. And Jayādvaita, I think you are also, no?

**Jayādvaita:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are good typist? [laughter] So why you have not published Bali-mardana's article?

**Jayādvaita:**
Bali-mardana's article.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayādvaita:**
We were waiting. We weren't sure if it was appropriate to publish it.

**Prabhupāda:**
He thought disappointed. He has published. He has written very nicely.

**Jayādvaita:**
He has written nicely?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayādvaita:**
We can publish it?

**Prabhupāda:**
So we should... Yes, here is the... What is that?

**Brahmānanda:**
"Illusion and Reality," two essays...

**Prabhupāda:**
He has presented very nicely. So we should encourage our men.

**Jayādvaita:**
Publish it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And our men, all our men should write. Otherwise how we shall know that he has understood the philosophy? Writing means //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam. Śravaṇam// means hearing from the authority and again repeat it. This is our business, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]], about Viṣṇu, not for any politician or any other man. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ,// about Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu. So that is success. Hear and repeat, hear and repeat. You haven't got to manufacture. Any one of us, simply if you reproduce the purport which I have given in the //Bhāgavata,// you become a good speaker. What I am doing? I am doing the same thing, writing the same thing, so that modern man can understand. Otherwise we are repeating the same thing. They are repeating also same thing, sense gratification. //Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām// [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]. But because that is material, they are not getting happiness. But the spiritual thing, we are chanting the same Hare Kṛṣṇa, simply repeating, but we are getting transcendental bliss. What we are doing? Same "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa." So process is the same; the subject matter is different. So why you are behind publication? Now all the big men are here. Why our books are behind? Why? Here the editors are there. I don't think there is any scarcity.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Now there is no scarcity.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Formerly it was... [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
We want to have the books printed very quickly, they have to be printed in America, the new books.

**Prabhupāda:**
And the reprint there.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Yes, we can do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why not give them some book also for ordinary?

**Rāmeśvara:**
We are giving them a lot of business this year in Japan.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. We must deal with them very nicely. They have helped in the beginning. Yes. I gave them only $5,000 start, and I gave the order for 52,000, but they supplied. They got money. They were confident that we shall not cheat them. So our relation is very nice. So utilize it. [break] ...girl was, that the Japanese, they like our publication.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Girl. Mūla-prakṛti.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Rāmeśvara:**
That girl that was seeing you in Hawaii, Mūla-prakṛti.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. She was very enthusiastic. Mūla-prakṛti? Where is Yadubara prabhu? Where is?

**Jayatīrtha:**
He's right here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. You are feeling now nice?

**Yadubara:**
Yes. I'm much improved.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. So everyone feeling nice?

**Devotees:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are also feeling nice?

**Viśākhā:**
Now I am all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Just see.

**Rāmeśvara:**
The devotees at the Press will not feel nice until all your books are published.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. That's nice. [laughter]

**Jayatīrtha:**
They are working now night shifts also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Twenty-four hours.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Twenty-four hours on the composers, so that we can take full advantage of the machines.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Hayagrīva prabhu, how many papers you are finishing? You can finish fifty papers at least.

**Hayagrīva:**
I am trying. One hour a tape.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Hayagrīva finished editing volume six of //Madhya-līlā// today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, volume six, //Caitanya-caritāmṛta?//

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
Yes. Out of nine volumes, Hayagrīva has finished six of //Madhya-līlā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Altogether there will be nine volumes?

**Rāmeśvara:**
Of //Madhya-līlā.//

**Jayatīrtha:**
//Madhya-līlā,// all nine volumes.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
And four volumes //Antya-līlā.//

**Jayatīrtha:**
Altogether sixteen volumes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is our Gargamuni?

**Bhavānanda:**
He is in the east. Buffalo.

**Prabhupāda:**
Preaching?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you are with him, Sudāmā?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Preaching is going on nice?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Hayagrīva told me that the whole //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// editing, will be finished by the end of August.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are coming also, Nitāi...?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Nitāi and Jagannātha are going to be coming...

**Rāmeśvara:**
In about three days.

**Jayatīrtha:**
By the end of July they'll be... So it is going very fast now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. //Tūrṇaṁ yateta.// We should try very fast before the next death comes. And death will come. So we shall prepare in such a way that before the next death comes over, we finish our Kṛṣṇa consciousness business and go back to home, back to Godhead. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. This is perfection. Because if we wait for another birth, maybe we may not get. Even Bhārata Mahārāja, he also slipped. He became a deer. So we should always be vigilant that "We have got this opportunity, human form of life. Let us utilize it to the fullest extent and be fit for going back to home, back to Godhead." That is intelligence. Not that "All right, I shall get again chance next birth." That is not very good policy. //Tūrṇam. Tūrṇam// means very hastily finish. //Tūrṇaṁ yateta anumṛtyuṁ pated yāvat// [SB 11.9.29]. [sound of men practicing karate in studio opposite has pervaded background of entire room conversation] These people are wasting time, as if they will live forever. [chuckles] What is the use of this kar...? Kara?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Karate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Karate. It is very popular in Mexico.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
But will that method save from death? When the death will come, will the sound "Go!" [laughter] will save them? This is foolishness. Instead of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, they are resounding some sound, thinking that the sound will save him. This is called foolishness, //mūḍha.// [karate men begin shouting very loudly; devotees laugh] //Piśācī pāile jane mati-cchanna haya// [//Prema-vivarta//]. And if you ask them that "Why you are sounding so loudly? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," they will laugh. [chuckles]

**Viṣṇujana:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, what did Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura mean when he said, "I am going, my work unfinished"?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Viṣṇujana:**
When Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura stated that he was leaving this planet with his work unfinished?

**Prabhupāda:**
Then let us finish. We are descendant of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. So he kept unfinished so that we shall get the chance to finish it. That is his mercy. He could have finished immediately. He is Vaiṣṇava; he is all-powerful. But he gave us chance that "You foolish people, you all also work." That is his mercy. So we should pray to Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura that "We are your grandchildren, great-grandchildren, so we have got some right to beg some mercy from you. The grandchildren get some indulgence from the grandfather. So I pray like that." It is Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's mercy. A Vaiṣṇava can... Kṛṣṇa doesn't require anyone's help.

Still, He is asking, "Surrender to Me." He doesn't require anyone's surrender. But it is for him good, one who surrenders. Not Kṛṣṇa is in need of anyone's service. He is complete. But He comes as if He is in helpless condition and asking for us to surrender. So that is for his good. One who is surrendered, he'll get the result. Kṛṣṇa is self-sufficient. Similarly, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura is self-sufficient. But if he said that "I keeping unfinished," that means he gave us the chance, the opportunity. So we should always pray to Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura to be merciful upon us so that we can execute his unfinished task. That should be our... And never we should think that "What Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura could not finish, I have finished." [laughs] Don't think like that. It is not like that. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta, eka ki āmāra nāhi pāya.// You have not given index. That I have instructed. You should now prepare index.

**Jayādvaita:**
That is being done for all the volumes.

**Prabhupāda:**
All the volumes must have index.

**Rādhā-vallabha:**
All the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// volumes have indexes.

**Jayādvaita:**
Bengali index.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the last one.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Bengali and Sanskrit verses, and then general index.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is there any //ekaki āmāra nāhi pāya mora? Eka ki?//

**Viṣṇujana:**
//Eke ke milila prabhu saba bhakta-gaṇa// [[books:cc:adi:17:79|[Cc. Ādi 17.79]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, not that. [break] ...observing //ekādaśī// today?

**Devotees:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So...

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda. [end]
