====== Car Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So why not serve the supreme strong?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is natural. //Nūnaṁ mahatāṁ tatra. Mahat// means bigger and more powerful, and //nunam// means there are less powerful. So everyone is less powerful than God. Then why don't you serve God? That is the perfection. You have to serve somebody strong. You cannot avoid it. Just study all status of society---animal society or human society. The law is that the stronger is dominating the weaker. That is the law. You cannot avoid it. So wherefrom this idea came unless it is in God? //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. All ideas come from the Supreme. That is the law, that the strong predominate over the weak. So who can be stronger than God? So this is our natural position, to serve God.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. And He is a nice master.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Perfect master. Even without becoming master He is providing everything. Even though those who do not accept Him, He is also giving them. So what to speak of those who have accepted Him? This is very simple philosophy. It is His position to accept service. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. It is good for the person who surrenders. Kṛṣṇa doesn't require your service. When He says, "You surrender to Me," it does not mean that Kṛṣṇa is suffering for your service. Kṛṣṇa is self-sufficient. He can create millions of servants like you. So He doesn't require your service. But if you serve, then it is your benefit. You become saved: "Now I am under the protection of a very able and, every respect, opulence of master." You are serving cats and dogs. Why not serve the most supreme, able and opulent master? This is going on. You have to serve. You cannot say, "No, no. I will not serve. I am independent." That is not possible. You have to serve. You have to serve, and you will be exploited by the imperfect master. So why not serve the perfect master so that you will not be exploited again? It is simple. [break]

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
...being servants, but we're...

**Prabhupāda:**
You have to serve. If you do not serve, the strong will force you to serve.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
And it's the most horrible service, too.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Now this, as you say that the Hawaiian, they are meant for cleansing the hotel to get some money. And without money, he cannot live. So he is forced to serve. What are the tanks? Petrol?

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
I think so. Yeah. Shell Oil. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore the good intelligence is //kāmādīnāṁ kati na katidhā pālitā durnideśān teṣāṁ mayi na karuṇā jātā na trapā nopaśāntiḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:22:16|[Cc. Madhya 22.16]]]: "I have served. I have served the so-called master. Actually I have served my senses." As they come to the hotel for sense gratification and do all nonsense and I have to serve him... So why I am serving? Oh, that is also for serving my senses. Without money, I cannot serve my senses.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Yes. So that's ultimately the problem.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Ultimately the problem, that we have to serve, and ultimately we have to serve our senses. Senses means lusty desires, //kāmādīnām. Kāma// means lust.

**Siddha-svarūpa:**
Addicted.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mātsarya. Kāma// means lusty. //Krodha// means anger. If my lusty desire is not fulfilled, then I become angry. Then I have to serve anger. //Kāma, krodha.// Then I become more greedy. //Kāma krodha lobha.// Then I become illusioned, //moha.// Then I become envious. In this way I have become implicated. So this service of this material world means I become more and more implicated. Therefore a devotee says, "My Lord, now I have got sense." What is that sense? "Now I am meant for service, I have rendered service, but nobody has become happy, either the master or myself. Therefore now I have got intelligence, why not serve You? You are the supreme master. So I have come to You. Please engage me in Your service." This is full surrender. //Kāmādīnāṁ kati na katidhā pālitā durnideśāḥ.// By serving this material objective, there is no peace. Everyone is unhappy although they are rendering service and taking service. This is going on, but nobody is happy, because this is artificial. Real service... Unless the thing comes to the real point, there is no peace. Here everyone is trying to become master, and everyone wants to avoid service. But by the nature's law, one has to become servant and render service, going on. Conglomeration. //Kāmādīnāṁ kati na katidhā pālitā durnideśās teṣāṁ mayi na karuṇā jātā na trapā nopaśāntiḥ. Harer nāma...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. [break] [end]
