====== Departure ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...these few days we passed together were very pleasing, and our only aim is how to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Vaiṣṇava's business is //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī. Para// means others, and //duhkha// means unhappy. So Vaiṣṇava personally has no unhappiness, because Vaiṣṇava is under the protection of Kṛṣṇa. So there is no question of unhappiness for a Vaiṣṇava. But Vaiṣṇava is unhappy by seeing others suffering. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// That is the definition of Vaiṣṇava.

> krpa-sindhubhya eva 
> patitanam pavanebhyo 
> vaisnavebhyo namo namah

**[I offer my respectful obeisances unto all the Vaiṣṇava devotees of the Lord. They can fulfill the desires of everyone, just like desire trees, and they are full of compassion for the fallen souls.]**

So Vaiṣṇava is //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// Practically every person, 99.9%, they are under the impression that "I am this body." This conception of life is animal consciousness. The dog is thinking, "I am this body." The cat is thinking, "I am this body." But actually we are not these bodies. That is the first instruction in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So, especially in the modern age, people are thinking like that, and they are unhappy. They don’t believe in the next life, although practically we see, every moment you are changing bodies.

So on the whole, //lokasya ajānataḥ,// they do not know what is the value of life. This is the position.

> lokasyājānato vidvāṁś
> cakre sātvata-saṁhitām

This is Vyāsadeva. Vyāsadeva compiled the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The purpose was that //anartha, anartha.// This body is //anartha. Anartha// means unnecessary. But we are put into such condition that this..., we are busy with... [break] ...we don’t require, just like to remain without any dress, that is the original condition. Now you can dress with so many outward coverings. But we spirit soul, we do not require this material dress, but somehow or other we have got it. This is //anartha. Anartha// means unwanted. So //anarthopaśamam,// how to get out of this //anartha,// unwanted thing. That means is //bhakti-yoga. Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje lokasya ajānatah.// People, though, do not know it. They are in the darkness of ignorance. Therefore this //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

So read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// assimilate it and preach in your own language. Or repeat whatever there is in the purport. Yesterday I was very much pleased to read the essays by our Bali-mardana dāsa. So similarly, you also write. Writing means if you have digested the idea, you can produce in your own words. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ.// One who has actually heard attentively, his next business will be how to describe it, //kīrtanaṁ. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ.// One who has heard nicely from the spiritual master, the next business will be how to chant it, repeat it. That is natural. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam...// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. These are the nine different processes.

So we have published so many books, not that simply for selling to others. We must read also, and digest, and write articles in our //Back to Godhead.// That is thoughtfulness. Vaiṣṇava, that another qualification is that he is a poet. Poet does not mean to write only big, big poetry; he is also maybe. Poet means one who can write. That is, out of the twenty-six qualifications, one of the qualification is every Vaiṣṇava should be expert in writing and [indistinct]. That is required. These are the qualifications. And //dakṣa. Dakṣa// means very expert. Any..., any business you give to Vaiṣṇava, he will be able to do it very nicely. There are twenty-six qualifications. So we have to develop these qualification. Vaiṣṇava does not means idle fools. No. Vaiṣṇava means expert in everything. Whatever Kṛṣṇa orders, there is. Very good.

So, you are very good combination. You have got nice place. So improve, improve your devotional activities, and this Hawaii, this place is also very nice. People work very nicely, and there are many people who are hankering after something spiritual. So these are the good opportunities, so be yourself a pure Vaiṣṇava. Pure Vaiṣṇava means //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. No more desires, //ār nā koriho mane āśā.// This is devotee. Except service of Kṛṣṇa, there is no other thing. That is devotee. So that service is given by the spiritual master, and the spiritual master will approve, "Yes your service is all right," then Kṛṣṇa is also pleased. So in this way execute devotional service. Try to do some good to others, because they are suffering on account of ignorance. //Lokasya ajānatah,// they do not know what is the aim of life, living like animals. So the Vedic //mantra// is, //uttisthatā jāgrata prāpya varān nibhodata.// The same Vedic //mantra// is sung by Bhaktivinode Thakura, //jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo.// So we have to awaken them. They are sleeping under the spell of //māyā,// and forgotten his real identity, and suffering---not only this life, life after lifetime. So, //ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa brahmite kona bhāgyavān jīva// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. So our..., it is our duty to awaken. If he does not awake, that is his misfortune, but our duty is, "Please, get up, get up, get up." This is our duty.

So do it very nicely here. You have got very nice place, and I thank you very much for your kindly dealing with me. So I hope I shall again come back.
