[purport] "//Tat-puruṣa// means a person engaging in Kṛṣṇa consciousness as the spiritual master..."

Translation: "My dear King, any sinful person, by practicing the principles of austerity, penance, brahmacarya and other practices, cannot become completely purified as one can by dedicating his life to the service of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet under the direction of the Lord's bona fide devotee."

**Prabhupāda:**

> na tathā hy-aghavān rājan
> pūyeta tapa-ādibhiḥ
> yathā kṛṣṇārpita-prāṇas
> tat-puruṣa-niṣevayā
> [[books:sb:6:1:16|[SB 6.1.16]]]

We are discussing the process of purification. Different methods have been described---by //prāyaścitta// and by //tapasya,// we have discussed. And then //kevalayā bhakta. Bhakti// includes everything---//karma, jñāna, yoga,// everything. And it is specially recommended that by austerities and other methods there is possibility, but it may not be successful. But if we adopt this process, devotional service, then it is sure.

So this purificatory process means //nivṛtti-mārga.// And //pravṛtti-mārga// means without any knowledge where we are going on, rushing on---we are doing everything, whatever we like---that is called //pravṛtti-mārga.// People are generally engaged in //pravṛtti-mārga.// Especially in this age, they do not care what is going to happen next. Therefore they feel relief that "There is no life after death. Let us enjoy this life to the best capacity. Then after death, never mind what will come." First of all, they deny to believe the next life. And even there is next life, and even if I am going to become cats and dogs, they do not mind. This is the experience of the modern age, irresponsible life.

But our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching people that "Don't live irresponsibly." Take, for example, that you may say, "There is no life." But if I put the argument, "Suppose there is life..." Now this is also supposition, because nobody, those who are in ignorance, they do not know whether there is life or whether there is no life. So you are arguing, "There is no life," but you do not know whether there is life. That is not in your knowledge. So supposing you have to take both the ways and think over it... You are simply thinking on the point that there is no life. Now, why don't you take my proposition, "If there is life?" Because you have not ascertained whether there is life. We say there is life. We take the example: just like this child has got his next life. The child may say, "There is no life next life." But actually that is not the fact. The fact is, there is life. The child will change this body and he will become a boy. And the boy will change this body; he will become young man. That is a fact. But by simply obstinacy if you say there is no life, that you can say. But take this argument: if there is life, then how much irresponsibly you are making your future life so dark. The same example: if a child does not go to school, does not take education, if he thinks, "There is no other life than this life. I shall play all day. Why shall I go to school?" he may say so, but there is life, and if he does not take education, in next life, when he is young man, if he is not posted in a good position, then he suffers. This is irresponsible life.

So before we get next life, we must be free from all sinful lifes. Otherwise we are not going to have better life. Especially going back to home, back to Godhead, one has to finish the resultant action of his sinful life in this life. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// you will find,

> yeṣām tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇāṁ
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

To become a staunch devotee of Kṛṣṇa, perfect devotee of Kṛṣṇa, means one has become freed from all reaction of sinful life. //Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpam.// No more committing any sinful activities. And whatever sinful activities he had done in his previous life, that is also negated. That is also made negation. There is no more reaction. //Yeṣām tu anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.// So people are engaged either in sinful activities or in pious activities. So those who have not only finished the resultant action of their past sinful activities but at the present moment they are simply engaged in pious activities, such person, //yeṣāṁ tu anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām, te,// such person, //dvandva-moha-nirmuktā,// without any hesitation, without any doubt, //bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ.// That is the... So anyone who is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service with firm conviction and devotion, it is to be understood that he is now free from all reaction of sinful activities. A Vaiṣṇava never commits any sinful activities, and whatever he had done in the past, that is also finished. This is said by Kṛṣṇa. Or in other words, if you devoutly engage yourself in the service of the Lord, then certainly you are freed from all reaction of sinful activities.

So how it is possible? //Yathā kṛṣṇārpita-prāṇaḥ. Prāṇaḥ, prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā// [SB 10.22.35]. //Prāṇa, prāṇa// means life. One who has dedicated his life to the service of Kṛṣṇa, such person. How this dedication of life to Kṛṣṇa's service can be made possible? That is also stated here: //tat-puruṣa-niṣevayā.// You have to take shelter of a person who is a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, and you have to serve. That means you have to accept a devotee, a true devotee, a pure devotee, as your guide. That is our process. The Rūpa Gosvāmī says in the //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// "The first process is, first step is," //ādau gurvāśrayam,// "to accept //guru.//" Accept //guru... Guru// means Kṛṣṇa's representative. One who is not Kṛṣṇa's representative, he cannot become //guru. Guru// does not mean any nonsense can become //guru.// No. Only //tat-puruṣa. Tat-puruṣa// means a person who has accepted the Supreme Personality of Godhead as everything. //Tat-puruṣa-niṣevayā.// That means Vaiṣṇava, pure devotee.

So it is not very difficult. By the grace of Kṛṣṇa there are pure devotees, so one has to take shelter of him. //Ādau gurvāśrayam.// Then //sad-dharma-pṛcchāt:// after accepting a bona fide spiritual master, one should be inquisitive to learn what is the science of Kṛṣṇa. //Sad-dharma-pṛcchāt sādhu-mārga-anugamanam.// And this Kṛṣṇa consciousness means one has to follow the footsteps of the devotees, //sādhu-mārga-anugamanam.// So who are those //sādhus?// That is also mentioned in the //śāstra.// We have already discussed.

> svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ
> kumāraḥ kapilo manuḥ
> prahlādo janako bhīṣmo
> balir vaiyāsakir vayam
> [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]

That two..., twelve personalities are mentioned especially, that they are //mahājana,// they are authorized, bona fide //guru,// and you have to follow their path. It is not difficult. So Svayambhū means Lord Brahmā. //Svayambhūḥ nāradaḥ śambhuḥ.// Śambhu means Lord Śiva. So each of them, out of these twelve //mahājana,// four are very prominent, that is, Svayambhū means Brahmā, and then //śambhuḥ,// Lord Śiva, and then //kumāraḥ.// And there is another //sampradāya,// Śrī-sampradāya, from Lakṣmījī. So we have to accept a spiritual master who are strictly in these four line of disciplic succession. Then we shall be gainer.

If we accept a so-called //guru,// then it will not be possible. We have to accept //guru// in the disciplic succession. Therefore it is recommended here, //tat-puruṣa-niṣevayā:// we have to serve him faithfully and always honestly. Then our purpose will be served. And if you take to this line of action, dedicating life to Kṛṣṇa and always engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa under the direction of //tat-puruṣa//---means who has no other business than to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness---then our life is successful. We become free from all sinful reaction. And without being purified... Because Kṛṣṇa, or God, is pure. Arjuna said, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ brahma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]: "My Lord Kṛṣṇa, You are the supreme pure." So unless we are pure, we cannot approach Kṛṣṇa. That is the statement in the //śāstra.// Without becoming fire, you cannot enter into fire. Similarly, without becoming completely pure, you cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That is accepted by all religious system. The Christian system is also like that, that without becoming pure you cannot enter into the kingdom of God.

So the human life is meant for this purification. We are working very hard for getting our daily bread. People are not getting their bread sitting idly. That is not possible. They are working very hard. This nice city of Denver is there. It has not sprung up from the jungle or desert. One had to work very hard to make this city so nicely, perfectly standing. So we have to work. If we want happiness, then we have to work. There is no doubt about it. But Kṛṣṇa says that //yānti deva-vratā devān// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]. Somebody is working to become happy within this material atmosphere by becoming very big man within this world. Or a little more intelligent: they are not happy in this life, but they want to become happy in the next life. Sometimes they go to the higher planetary system. So //yānti deva-vratā devān pitṛn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]. So as you work, you get the desired result. But at the last line, Kṛṣṇa says, //mad-yājino'pi yānti mām:// "If you work or if you worship Me, then you come to Me."

Then where is the difference between going to Kṛṣṇa and keeping within this material world? The difference is //ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]. In this material world even if you go to the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, still, there is birth, death, old age and disease. Or you have to return back again. Just like these people are going to the moon planet and again coming back here. So this kind of going and coming back here is not good. //Yad gatvā na nivartante// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. If you go to such planet wherefrom you haven't got to come back again to this material world, that is highest perfection. That is Kṛṣṇaloka. So Kṛṣṇa says that "If you are working so hard to become happy in this material world, the same labor, if you worship Me, Kṛṣṇa, then you come to Me." //Mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām.// What is the benefit especially? Now, //mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam nāpnuvanti// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]: "Anyone who comes to Me, he hasn't got to come back again to this material world."

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching people how to go back to home, back to Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. That will make the people happy eternally. So in this life also, Kṛṣṇa conscious people, they are not unhappy. You can see practically. We are sitting in a very nice room and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and taking //prasādam.// Where is unhappiness? There is no unhappiness. And other processes, they have to undergo so many unhappy processes. Here, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is nothing unhappiness. That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā: susukham kartum avyayam// [[books:bg:9:2|[Bg. 9.2]]]. //Susukham.// When you execute devotional service, it is not only //sukham---sukham// means happiness---but another word is added, //susukham,// "very comfortable, very happy." //Kartum,// to execute devotional service, is great pleasure, great happiness. And //avyayam. Avyayam// means whatever you do, that is your permanent asset. Other things, that is finishable. Suppose you are very much advanced, educated person. You have passed M.A., Ph.D., and something, something. But it is not //avyayam;// it is //vyayam. Vyayam// means it is finishable. As soon as your body is finished, your so-called degrees all finished. Then again next life if you become a human being, of course again there is chance of becoming M.A., Ph.D., but the first M.A., Ph.D. in this life, that is finished.

So whatever we are acquiring here, that is not //avyayam. Vyayam// means expenditure, and //a// means "not." Not expenditure. If you have got some money, if you spend, then it is //vyayam,// finished after some time. //Avyayam// means you spend as much, still not finished. That is //avyayam.// So devotional service of Kṛṣṇa is explained as //susukhaṁ kartum avyayam.// Whatever you do, if you have attained success ten percent, that ten percent your permanent. Therefore it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā, śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sanjāyate// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. Those who could not finish the //bhakti-yoga// in this life, they get another chance of human life. Not only human life; it is stated they go to the heavenly planet, they enjoy there, and then again come back in this planet. And that also not ordinary man. //Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe:// he takes birth in very sanctified family, just like //brāhmaṇa//-Vaiṣṇava, //śucīnām,// and //śrīmatām,// very rich family. Then it is his duty.

So those who are born rich... You Americans, you are supposed to be born rich. Actually it is so. So you should think in this term, that "Due to our previous devotional service, by Kṛṣṇa's grace we have got our birth in this country. There is no poverty," //śrīmatām.// So you should take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness very seriously. You have got the opportunity. You are not poverty-stricken. You haven't got to waste your time, "Where is food? Where is food? Where is food?" Just like in other, poverty-stricken country, they are embarrassed to find out food. But you are very fortunate. So don't waste this opportunity by becoming hippies. Don't waste. Become devotee, Kṛṣṇa's devotee. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is there, and we have got so many centers. Just try to learn this Kṛṣṇa consciousness science and make your life perfect. That is our request.

Thank you very much.
