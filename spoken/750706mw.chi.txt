====== Morning Walk ======

[in car]

**Jagadīśa:**
...discussed with Satsvarūpa Mahārāja and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Jagadīśa:**
Because it would greatly facilitate my preaching.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are already preaching.

**Jagadīśa:**
But many of the devotees are not so inclined to listen to a householder as to a //sannyāsī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Neither to the //sannyāsīs.// [//japa//] [break] ...this building?

**Brahmānanda:**
It's the univers... It's a theo... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Not for the students?

**Jagadīśa:**
That's what they originally were for.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now? [break] Eucalyptus? No.

**Sudāmā:**
No, Prabhupāda. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...one for the bathroom[?]. [break] Eh? Fifth class. [break] ...fourth class.

[break] ...class. The same?

**Sudāmā:**
It's the same one.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you were... Many years ago you used to have me send you eucalyptus twigs from San Francisco.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So now that you're in America we can easily arrange for that to be done. They can be sent. They take only one day by air.

**Prabhupāda:**
So wherefrom?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, San Francisco is the best area for eucalyptus.

**Prabhupāda:**
So arrange.

**Jagadīśa:**
We have them already, Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hey? [indistinct]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'll arrange today.

**Prabhupāda:**
Arrange that three corner, four corner, square.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Square set, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Square side. That is good---square and green.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And green. And as thick as the finger?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
As thick as ones finger?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, this much. Top of the little finger. [//japa//] [break] ...about forty miles off, there is a place known as Geokhali. There the Ganges is so vast. You have seen it? No. Eh?

**Viṣṇujana:**
Yeah, I think so. I saw it three miles wide. One place where I was sailing on the Ganges it was three miles wide by Mangir.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Munger. No, Munger is far off. It is near Calcutta. [break] ...snowfall here?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Snowfall?

**Devotee (1):**
It's very heavy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Heavy?

**Devotee (1):**
Oh, yes. It becomes very cold here. [break]

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
...all ice. In the wintertime, this becomes ice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Become ice?

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh? [break] ...walk?

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, everyone likes to go out and walk around on it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Ice skating. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...was seeing in that paper, the meeting, a photograph of Jaya Prakash Narayan and Mrs. Gandhi. Both of the meetings were overcrowded. So who is right and who is wrong? People were hearing in throngs both of them. So? Who is wrong, who is right? [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...newspaper report here was that the crowds who came to cheer Indira Gandhi, that they were paid, paid crowds. They would pay them one rupee each.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?// [laughter] Yes. [pause] That is for car or...?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Car, yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...any bird called thunderbird?

**Bahulāśva:**
Thunderbird? A big bird, big eagle, in the United States.

**Prabhupāda:**
No big eagle. Thunderbird. You have seen in this car?

**Brahmānanda:**
Automobile is called.

**Prabhupāda:**
But actually is there any bird called thunderbird?

**Jagadīśa:**
It's a legendary bird from Indian legend. American Indian.

**Prabhupāda:**
Indian legend?

**Brahmānanda:**
Of the American Indians, the Red Indians. They... Sometimes their chiefs are called Chief Thunderbird. It's a popular name for their chiefs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Oh. We have got an idea of thunderbird. The bird flies in the..., near the cloud in expectation of water, and they are not afraid of thunder. That is called //cātaka.// That example is given by Rūpa Gosvāmī. The //cātaka// does not take water from ground. They will take water when it falls from the cloud. So in the beginning of every cloud there is thunder. So this bird, because they expecting water from the cloud, the cloud is giving him thunder, but still he does not..., will not take water from ground.

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
In what connection do the Gosvāmīs use that example to illustrate?

**Prabhupāda:**
Example means a devotee will take mercy from Kṛṣṇa, not from the material world. Even there is thunder---Kṛṣṇa does not give mercy but puts him into difficulty---still, he will not take any mercy from the material world. This is the ex... [break]

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
You are showing your mercy upon us. How do we prevent ourselves from becoming //guru-druha,// or ungrateful for the benediction you are giving us?

**Prabhupāda:**
So, you want to be //guru-druha?// Eh?

**Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. [break] ...come when there will be lightning, thunder, but there will be no rain. [end]
