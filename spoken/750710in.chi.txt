====== Lecture and Initiation ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> anarpita-carīṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇaḥ kalau
> samarpayitum unnataḥ ujjvala-rasāṁ sva-bhakti-śriyam
> hariḥ puraṭa-sundara-dyuti-kadamba-sandīpitaḥ
> sadā hṛdaya-kandare... [break] ...śacī-nandana
> [[books:cc:adi:1:4|[Cc. Ādi 1.4]]]

This verse is given by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī about Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //anarpita-carīṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatīrṇaḥ kalau.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, has many expansion, or incarnation, but this expansion, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is unique, because in other incarnation the duty is //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. In Kṛṣṇa //avatāra,// Kṛṣṇa had to fight with the so many demons, but this incarnation, there is no question of fighting with the demons, but simply by mercy they were delivered, just like Jagāi-Mādhāi. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung, //vrajendra-nandana yei, śacī-suta hoilo sei:// "The same Personality of Godhead who was formerly the son of Nanda Mahārāja, Vrajendra-nandana, He has now appeared as the son of mother Śacī." //Balarāma hoilo nitāi:// "And Balarāma, Devakī..., Rohiṇī-nandana, He has become Nityānanda."

The same Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma has become Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Nityānanda Prabhu. So what is Their business? The business is: //pāpī-tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo.// They delivered, simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// all people who were sinful and suffering. In the material world we are suffering. This is a place of suffering. //Duḥkhalayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]], Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// So there are different methods of mitigating suffering, but in this age, Kali-yuga, simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// the //pāpī-tāpī,// those who are sinful and suffering, they can be delivered. This is the unique contribution of this incarnation, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This is composed by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī.

There are many other verses, and there is special one verse in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Eleventh Canto:

> kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ
> sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam
> yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair
> yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ
> [SB 11.5.32]

//Yajña,// sacrifice... //Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyā.// Human life is meant for performing //yajña,// give in charity and practice austerities---three things. Human life means that. Human life does not mean to live like cats and dogs. That is failure. That kind of civilization, dog civilization, is failure of human life. Human life is meant for three things: //yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-kriyā.// One should know how to perform sacrifices, how to give in charity and how to practice austerities. This is human life. So //yajña-dāna-tapasya,// in other ages they were performing according to the means. Just like in the Satya-yuga, Vālmīki Muni, he practiced austerities, meditation, for sixty thousands of years. At that time people were living one hundred thousands of years. That is not possible now. Meditation was possible in those ages, but now it is not possible. Therefore the //śāstra// recommends that //yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyaiḥ:// "You perform this //yajña, saṅkīrtana.//" So by performing //saṅkīrtana-yajña,// you can get the same result. As Vālmīki Muni got the result after meditation of sixty thousands of years, you can have the same result simply by performing //saṅkīrtana-yajña// maybe a few days. It is so kindness.

So I am very glad that in the Western countries, especially in America, you fortunate boys and girls, you have joined in this //saṅkīrtana-yajña.// People are appreciating. I am also very much pleased. So this //yajña,// as you have taken the Deity in buses, going to the interior and performing //yajña...// Continue this process until your whole country nationally accept this creed.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
They will accept. [laughter] It is predicted by Caitanya Mahāprabhu,

> pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma
> sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma
> [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]

Caitanya Mahāprabhu desired that in every village, every town, every county, every city, this //saṅkīrtana// movement will be there, and people will feel obliged to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: "My Lord, You have given us so sublime thing." This is the prediction. Simply we have to try our best. So it is not very difficult. You have installed the Deity. Take in different buses and go from city to city, town to town, village to village. And you have got now experience, so expand this movement. As I have repeatedly told you that your country, America, is fortunate, and they require only this, //saṅkīrtana.// Then they will be perfect.

I was discussing so many things yesterday---perhaps you have seen in the paper---that a thorough overhauling required, spiritual overhauling. Now, at the present moment things are going not very nicely. Materially, don't be sorry that this racing will not help us in our spiritual life. Materially be advanced, but don't forget your spiritual duty and spiritual identity. Then it is loss. Then it is //śrama eva hi kevalam// [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]], simply working for nothing, just like your moon expedition, simply a waste of time and unnecessarily expenditure of money.

So many billions of dollars you have spoiled, and what you have got? A little dust, that's all. Don't be foolish in that way. Just be practical. If such huge amount of money, dollars, would have been spent in distributing this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over your country, then immense benefit would have been achieved. Anyway, we cannot say anything. Your money you can squander away. That is your business. But we request the authorities and the sane men that you take up this //saṅkīrtana// movement, especially in America, and expand this to other parts of the world, Europe, Asia. You have got already honor as the richest nation of the world. You have got intelligence. You have got everything. Just take up this movement, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, with patience and with diligence and intelligence. It is very easy. You are already experienced. Do not stop it. Increase more and more. Your country will be happy, and the whole world will be happy.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda. //Haribol.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think now we have to give the spiritual names to these devotees?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, but they have to..., purification //mantra, nama apavitraḥ pavit...// So who will lead?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Viṣṇujana Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do it. //Nama,// [devotees respond] //apavitraḥ, pavitro vā.//

**Viṣṇujana:**
[leads chanting of //mantra// three times; with Prabhupāda taking over again halfway]

**Prabhupāda:**
Thrice. [devotees chant //japa//] This is called...

**Viṣṇujana:**
[leads chanting of //mantra// again]

**Devotee:**
[asks Prabhupāda during the chanting of //mantras://] Should we arrange all the men to come up and...?

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not possible. [chanting of //mantra// and //japa// continue] [break] ...later on. In the meantime, you can take your beads, and after it is distributed, you can explain and then perform //yajña.// Give me. Come on.

**Śrī Govinda:**
Sai?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Where's Bhakta Sai? [end]
