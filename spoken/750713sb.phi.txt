"At the time of death, Ajāmila saw three awkward persons, very fearsome in appearance, with ropes in their hands. They had twisted faces and deformed bodily features, and their hair stood on end. They had come to take Ajāmila away to the shelter of Yamarāja. Ajāmila became extremely bewildered when he saw them. His small child, Nārāyaṇa, was playing a little distance off, and with tearful eyes and great anxiety, he called the name of his son very loudly three times, 'Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa!' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Is there "three times"?

**Nitāi:**
It said in the manuscript. The manuscript said "three times."

**Prabhupāda:**
Who said in the manuscript? There is no three times. Not "Nārāyaṇa" three times. One time, "O Nārāyaṇa," that's all. So did I say "three times"? Hmm? No, it is not said here. You should correct it. Once, //hey,// "O Nārāyaṇa," that's all. There is no reason of calling three times. There is no mention here. Once is sufficient. [laughter] Hmm.

//Uccair ājuhāva,// very loudly, "Nārāyaṇa!" Like that. That's all. //Uccair ājuhāva ākulendriyaḥ.// Hmm. So you edited it? Not yet?

**Nitāi:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you should keep at least what is there. So this is the position at the time of death. Sometimes you will find the dying man is crying, //ākulendriyaḥ,// tearful eyes. He cannot express. He is not practiced. But he was given the chance. Kṛṣṇa gave him the conscience when the child was born to keep his name Nārāyaṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy, that "This rascal was My devotee, and now he is so fallen. All right, he is attracted to his children." So He gave the conscience, "Now keep your son's name Nārāyaṇa." //Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa is situated in everyone's heart. //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. Kṛṣṇa says, "From Me everything---remembrance and forgetfulness---come." Those who want to forget Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa helps him to forget: "All right, you forget." He does not give. He does not dictate from the within. And one who is foolishly in bad association, unfortunately forgets Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa gives him chance. Offenders are very nuisance. Kṛṣṇa... Too much offender, purposefully, //guru-//Vaiṣṇava, his position is very difficult. But by chance if one forgets Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa does not forget him.

Therefore in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said,

> api cet sudurācāro
> bhajate mām ananya-bhāk
> sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ
> samyag vyavasito hi saḥ
> [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]

Practiced..., we are practiced to so many bad habits life after life in this material condition. So sometimes, one who is engaged in devotional service to the Lord may, on account of old practice, he commits some sinful activities. Kṛṣṇa forgives him. He knows that he is sincere, but on account of his old practice, he has done something mistake. There is a verse, //saḥ pāda-mūlaṁ bhajatāṁ priyasya.// Somehow or other, you become recognized by Kṛṣṇa, //priya.// Kṛṣṇa may know that "He is sincerely trying to do something for render..." Kṛṣṇa does not require your service or my service. He is self-sufficient. If we render service, that is for..., that is good for us. Kṛṣṇa, He recognizes, "Oh, now he has again begun service. That's nice." So to such person Kṛṣṇa excuses. //Saḥ pāda-mūlaṁ bhajatāṁ priyasya.// That verse. Now I forget. There is a verse like that.

So the Ajāmila, young man, on account of association with a prostitute, he lost his good character and began to maintain the prostitute by stealing, by cheating, one after another. So by mistake or on account of the age, he became captivated by the prostitute. So Kṛṣṇa was watching. Therefore He gave him this chance that on account of his affection towards the child, he will at least repeat "Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa." "Nārāyaṇa come. Nārāyaṇa take your food. Nārāyaṇa sit down." So //bhāva-grāhi-janārdanaḥ// [//CB Ādi-khaṇḍa// 11.108]. Kṛṣṇa is so kind, He takes the purpose, or the essence. Because the holy name has its effect. So although this Ajāmila, by his foolishness, he was attached to the material body of the son, but because he was chanting "Nārāyaṇa," Kṛṣṇa was taking that essence, that's all, that "Some way or other, he is chanting." The importance of chanting is so nice. So do not give up chanting. Then Kṛṣṇa will protect you. This is the example. "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa," you practice. Naturally, when you are in danger, you will say, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." This much do. If you are practiced to do something, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, then you are safe.

So it is not difficult. Sincerely chant. Try to avoid offense. Don't try to fall down purposefully for sense gratification. That is very dangerous. He... Purposefully, he did not fall down. Circumstantially came in contact with a prostitute, could not help him. So circumstantially he fell down, not by willingly. This should be noted. Willingly doing, that is very great offense. But circumstantially there is every chance, because we are fallen and practiced to malpractices life after life. Because the material life means sinful life. You see the whole people. They do not care. They do not know even this is sinful. We say, "No illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication and no gambling." So Western people will think, "What is this nonsense? These are the preliminary facilities for a human being, and this man is denying." They do not know even. Some of our students left this institution. They thought that "Swāmījī is denying the primary necessities of life." They are so dull that they cannot understand this is sinful. Not only ordinary, common man, even a big man, Lord Zetland in England. So one of my Godbrothers went to preach, and Lord Zetland, Marquess of Zetland... He was known as Lord Ronaldsay. He was governor of Bengal. In our college days he came to our coll... He's Scotch man. So very gentleman and inclined to philosophy. So he asked this Godbrother, "Can you make me //brāhmaṇa?//" So he proposed, "Yes, why not? You follow these rules and regulation, you will become //brāhmaṇa.//" So when he heard the rules and regulation---no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxication---he said, "Oh, it is impossible. It is not possible." He flatly refused, that "In our country it is not possible."

So it is very difficult job, but if one is able to give up these sinful activities, then his life is very pure. He becomes purified. And unless one is purified, he cannot chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, neither he can understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

> yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

This Kṛṣṇa says. "One who has ended the process of sinful activities and engaged in pious activities, such person can become a firm devotee." So these four principle, as we have recommended, you must follow. There is no question of optional, "I may do it, I may not do." No, you must. Otherwise, the progress will be checked. Kṛṣṇa will not leave you. Just like the Ajāmila: the progress was checked, but because he did not do it willfully, therefore Kṛṣṇa was giving him opportunity. As soon as possible, again capture him. Because he did not do anything willfully. First of all, this is the condition, circumstantial. Therefore Kṛṣṇa was very kind. He gave him the son, "Call him. You have affection for your son? All right, chant 'Nārāyaṇa' by calling your son." This opportunity was given.

So for his sinful activities he saw fierceful features of these order carriers, or Yamadūta. That is going on. If one is not offender, then he has no chance even to see the Yamadūta. But because willfully or nonwillfully he was engaged in sinful activities---associating with the prostitute, and for maintaining the prostitute he was planning so many sinful activities, cheat and take others' money and enjoy---for that reason, he had to see. And if he remains pure, he hasn't got to see. This is the difference.

So regular resultant action of sinful life, one has to. Just like Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja. Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja was advised by Kṛṣṇa that "You go to Droṇācārya and tell him the lies." "What is that?" "Now, tell him that 'Your son Aśvatthāmā is dead.' " Because Droṇācārya had some benediction that unless he is shocked by the death of his son, he will never die. So Kṛṣṇa had to take this diplomatic, because it is politics. So Kṛṣṇa... Because Droṇācārya will not believe anyone. He knew that Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira is a most pious man; he never tells lies. So if Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira goes and says that "Your son is dead," then he will believe. Otherwise, Kṛṣṇa could have gone personally, but He knew that people do not believe Him. [laughter] He is very tricky. [laughter] So therefore no tricky man can excel Him. A man may be very tricky, very intelligent, but he will not be able to excel Kṛṣṇa. He is more tricky. Just like in His childhood, Kṛṣṇa was naughty, so mother wanted to bind Him. So Kṛṣṇa also became tricky. Mother first of all brought some rope and bound, and when it was to be knotted, it was short. And then again she joined another rope. In this way, whatever rope store she had, she brought one after another, and at last, when knotting, it is too... What is called?

**Devotees:**
Inches.

**Prabhupāda:**
Short. So she... Kṛṣṇa thought, "Mother, nobody can bind Me, and because I have accepted to become your child, you are trying to bind Me? All right, you bring your all ropes. You will never be able to bind Me." This is Kṛṣṇa. But Mother Yaśodā is the greatest devotee. So when Kṛṣṇa saw that "My mother is now exhausted, perspiring. All right, you can bind Me." This is the... You have seen in the //Kṛṣṇa// book. So //ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. If you want to play tricks with Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is the greater trick. You will never be able. That is our mistake, that we think that "I am so intelligent, I can do something without the knowledge of Kṛṣṇa." That is our foolishness. Kṛṣṇa says, //sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]: "I am sitting in everyone's heart." How you can cheat Him? It is not possible. Don't try to cheat Kṛṣṇa. Don't try to cheat //guru.// Don't try to cheat Kṛṣṇa. Then your progress is sure. //Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. You are singing daily, //śrī-guru-caraṇa...// What is that? //Śrī-guru...//

**Devotees:**
//Śrī-guru-caraṇa-padma, kevala-bhakati-sadma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that...

**Devotee:**
//Guru-mukha?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya.// Don't try to cheat //guru.// Then progress will be checked.

> ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān
> nāvamanyeta karhicit
> na martya-buddhyāsūyeta
> sarva-devamayo guruḥ
> [SB 11.17.27]

//Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān.// Kṛṣṇa says, "//Ācārya// means I am." //Nāvamanyeta karhicit:// "Do not try to neglect." //Na martya-buddhyāsūyeta:// "Do not consider //ācārya,// spiritual master, as ordinary human being and become envious." These things are warned. //Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit, na martya-buddhyāsūyeta.// Familiarity breeds contempt. That is not good. Similarly... Because by the mercy of //ācārya,// by the mercy of //guru,// you will get Kṛṣṇa. You sing that, //kṛṣṇa-prāpti jāhā hoite,// what is that?

**Devotee:**
//Kṛṣṇa-prāpti hoiya jānā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kṛṣṇa-prāpti jāhā hoite.// What is that language?

**Kṛta-kṛta:**
That by his mercy he brings us close to Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, what is that Bengali language? You cannot... You are singing daily?

**Kṛta-kṛta:**
//Prema-bhakti jāhā hoite, avidyā vināśa jāte.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. //Avidyā vināśa jāte, kṛṣṇa-prāpti haya...// So these are the things. //Avidyā vināśa jāte. Avidyā// means ignorance. We are full of ignorance. So //guru's// duty is to open the eyes, and by opening your eyes he will give you Kṛṣṇa. So this is the process. So you should be very much careful not to cheat Kṛṣṇa, not to cheat //guru,// and become very sincere and follow. Then it is guaranteed. //Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. Two things required. You cannot jump over Kṛṣṇa, neglecting //guru.// Then it is finished. If you want to jump over Kṛṣṇa without favor of the //guru...// Kṛṣṇa is not so easy. So these things should be very carefully observed. No offense. Sincerely follow. Then Kṛṣṇa will protect, and your progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to go back to home, back to Godhead, will be assured, insured.

So this man circumstantially fell down. So Kṛṣṇa is saving him. Kṛṣṇa is saving him, and he will be saved. We shall see in the following passage.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
