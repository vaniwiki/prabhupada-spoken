====== Morning Walk ======

[sound of bird chirping]

**Prabhupāda:**
...take the fruits and singing morning. They are happier.

**Rāmeśvara:**
When we tell people that they may take their next birth as an animal, they say that is all right, because the animals are happier than the humans.

**Prabhupāda:**
But because you are rascal, you do not know you can become more happier, go back to home, back to Godhead. That you do not know. [sounds of bird singing] Just see how. What is this?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's the bird that was singing. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...there? A small bird!

**Jayatīrtha:**
There's one expression in America, "Free as a bird." People think that the birds are more free than they are.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, certainly.

**Devotee:**
Also, "The birds and the bees." Culminate in sex life. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Balboa Park.

**Satsvarūpa:**
He was a Spanish explorer. He's supposed to be the first one to see the Pacific Ocean.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Balboa.

**Jayatīrtha:**
He was the first white man to discover California, I think?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yeah. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
First man to see the Pacific?

**Yadubara:**
Yes.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Only four hundred years ago.

**Jayatīrtha:**
First white man.

**Yadubara:**
The Indians were there, of course. The Red Indians were already there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yadubara:**
In California.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone was there, but they do not know. [chuckles] The Pacific and Atlantic ocean is mentioned in Kalidāsa Kavi's book, //Kumāra-sambhava. Toya-nidhim avagahya sthitaḥ pṛthivyām iva māna-daṇḍaḥ.// They are all mentioned, Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean. These fools do not know anything. And they say, therefore, "First man to come," as if before him there was no man. Just see. [chuckles] "There was no man. There was no civilization," these rascals' version. What is that bridge? Is that bridge?

**Jayatīrtha:**
It's a bridge that goes to one island. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...explain; therefore they bring this theory of chance. But we don't find any such chance in practical life. "There was a fool, and he became high-court judge." Is there any? "There was a fool. He became a high-court judge." Is there any evidence like that? "There was ape. It became human, human being." I am simply surprised how this kind of argument is accepted by other fools.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And if you don't accept it, then they fail you in the examination.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If you don't accept and repeat it, then you become failed in the examination. Then you can't get a diploma. Then you cannot get a good job. So they force you to repeat it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Field. All of a sudden it became by chance a garden and beautiful, everything. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
El Cid Conquedor.

**Jayatīrtha:**
He was a famous Spanish soldier.

**Rāmeśvara:**
He fought the Muslims when they invaded Spain. He is a famous Spanish man who fought against the Muslims when they invaded. From Africa, they crossed over the sea and invaded Spain.

**Brahmānanda:**
The Moors.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Moors, yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Go away.

**Brahmānanda:**
Hundred miles high.

**Prabhupāda:**
This has got some meaning. What is this matchbox? There is earth, there is sense, there is comfort. So, we shall go this way or...? [break]

**Jayatīrtha:**
If we turn off, we go this way?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is all vacant? [break] Big demonstration of cow fighting, bull fighting, and kill them. Such a Christian is trying to convert others as Christians. Just see the fun. Christ said, "Thou shall not kill," and they are sporting with the life of bull, and they are Christian. We have to believe.

**Yadubara:**
Isn't that somewhat in the //kṣatriya// spirit?

**Prabhupāda:**
Nonsense spirit. Rascal spirit.

**Yadubara:**
But sometimes those people get killed when they're fighting the bull.

**Prabhupāda:**
But your arrangement is to kill the bull. By chance, or by God's desire, you become killed.

**Brahmānanda:**
It's a very popular sport. People enjoy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And they are Christians.

**Jayatīrtha:**
I think before the bullfighter goes to the ring, he first goes to the church...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Jayatīrtha:**
...and prays for blessings that he will be able to do very nicely.

**Brahmānanda:**
And everyone gets drunk.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good preaching.

**Yadubara:**
They also have those cock fights, you know, those chicken fights. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...begin war with their own children. This is also war. The child wants to come out, and they are fighting. Advanced. [end]
