====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.50 ======

**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [break] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

> pañcabhiḥ kurute svārthān
> pañca vedātha pañcabhiḥ
> ekas tu ṣoḍaśena trīn
> svayaṁ saptadaśo 'śnute
> [[books:sb:6:1:50|[SB 6.1.50]]]

[break] [00:48]

"The mind is the sixteenth item, and above the mind, the soul is the seventeenth item. He is the living being; therefore he is one only. In cooperation with the other fifteen items along with the mind, the living entity is enjoying the material world alone. The instruments are the five sense organs, the five working organs and the five objects of the senses. Thus the mind is sixteen and the living entity himself is seventeen. In this way the living entity is enjoying different situations of three types, namely happiness, distress or a mixture of both."

**Prabhupāda:**

> pañcabhiḥ kurute svārthān
> pañca vedātha pañcabhiḥ
> ekas tu ṣoḍaśena trīn
> svayaṁ saptadaśo 'śnute
> [[books:sb:6:1:50|[SB 6.1.50]]]

So we are fallen into great ocean of nescience, covered. First of all the five senses, knowledge-acquiring senses, //jñānendriya;// and //karmendriya,// working senses, ten; and sense object... We have got eyes; therefore eyes are engaged for seeing something beautiful, //rūpa. Rasa. Rasa// means taste. That is the business of the tongue. And to see beautiful thing, that is the business of the eyes. //Rūpa, rasa, śabda. Śabda// means sound. The ear..., we have got ear. We want to hear nice songs, music, radio, television. So ear is there; the objects are there. //Rūpa, rasa, śabda, gandha,// smelling. There is good odor also, bad odor also. //Rūpa, rasa, gandha, śabda, sparśā.// In this way we are entangled, completely under the laws of material nature. I am the spirit soul. //Saptadaśaḥ.// I have given my power of attorney to the mind, and mind is creating different varieties of the //śabda, sparśā..., rūpa, rasa, gandha, śabda, sparśā.// In this way, life after life, as it is explained in the previous verse,

> yathājñas tamasā
> upāste vyaktam eva hi
> na veda pūrvam aparaṁ
> naṣṭa-janma-smṛtis tathā
> [[books:sb:6:1:49|[SB 6.1.49]]]

So //naṣṭa-jan...// I do not know. "I do not know" means I cannot remember what I did in my past life and what is going to happen in the next life. In ignorance, //tamasā. Ajñas tamasā upāste.// This is //tamo-guṇa.// The present life as it is, we try to enjoy, that's all, without caring for the next life or without understanding what was my past life. But human being should be intelligent enough that "Why...? I am enjoying or I am suffering. The other person, he is differently enjoying or suffering differently. Why the differences are there?" This is intelligence. Why not one kind of enjoyment? Why not everyone millionaire? Why not everyone pauper, or poor? There are varieties. So they do not consider it. They are so fool, they... They should, that "Why I am put into this condition? Why he is put into another condition? Why the other is put in another condition?" That is called //tamasā.// They do not care to know also. //Tamasā. Tamase ca.//

So this is not life. This is animal life. Therefore Vedic injunction is, "Don't keep in this animal life." //Tamasi mā:// "Don't keep yourself in this darkness." //Jyotir gama:// "Come to the light." So //jyotir gama// means... That is //tapasya.// To come to the platform of light, it requires //tapasya,// austerity. That is required. The human life is meant for //tapasya,// to come to the life platform. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattva// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. Tamasic or //tamas,// or darkness, means just like a person is attacked with tuberculosis, but he doesn't care for it. But intelligent man goes to the physician, asks that "Why I am suffering? What is the medicine?" That is intelligence. So human life begins when one is inquisitive to know, "Why I am suffering?" That is human life. And if he keeps himself in darkness---"Oh, this is... Suffering is suffering. Let me enjoy..." Sometimes they want to forget the suffering by another suffering, drinking or LSD, to forget suffering. That is another suffering, another suffering so much so that one becomes crazy and commits suicide. This is going on, a very precarious life. And human life is the only opportunity to rectify these mistakes and come to his original position, constitutional position, means the spiritual platform.

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

That is wanted. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ.// As soon as one becomes //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// then immediately he becomes //prasannātmā,// jubilant. Just like one is suffering from a disease, and some way or other, when he is relieved from that disease, immediately he becomes jubilant. That is required. That is wanted. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. And when one becomes jubilant, then in that attitude, one can enter into devotional service of the Lord, not in the material condition, which is always suffering. //Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. But we go on suffering just like animal. Animal is being taken to the slaughterhouse; still, he is eating very jubilantly. Next item, he will be killed. So this kind of consciousness is called animal consciousness.

> yasyātma-buddhiḥ kunape tri-dhātuke
> svā-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> ...sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

//Go-kharaḥ.//

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to deliver people from this ignorant..., ignorance platform and bring him to the light platform, or..., and knowledge platform, so that one can understand what is his constitutional position, how he can stop the sufferings of life, and how one can become eternally blissful life of knowledge. [break] ...consciousness. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He has given us the //Śikṣāṣṭaka. Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. By chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra...// [break] ...in the //Bhāgavata// says //tapasā. Tapasā// means by undergoing severe austerities, penances. //Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena vā// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. This is the instruction in the //śāstra.// One has to become perfect by //tapasā,// by austerities. //Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa.// And becoming //brahmacārī,// celibate. What is called? Celibate life? Eh?

**Jagadīśa:**
Celibacy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Celibacy, yes. Life of celibacy, controlling the sex desire. This is //tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena vā// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. These things are education. And what is this nonsense education how to become a big mechanics of motorcar parts? This is not education. This is //śūdra, śūdra// education. It is not education. It is called //śilpa. Śilpa-vidyā, brahma-vidyā. Vidyā// means //brahma-vidyā.// Therefore, in the Vedic society, education was meant for the //brāhmaṇas.// Education was not meant for the //śūdras.// Education was meant for the //brāhmaṇas,// and partially of the //kṣatriyas,// neither of the //vaiśyas// nor of the //śūdras.// What education? //Vaiśya's// livelihood is, or his occupational duty is, how to produce food, how to give protection to the cows, and if there is excess stock, how to trade with it. So anyone can learn by seeing only. It doesn't require any high education. If the father is tilling the field, the son can learn it by seeing it. If the father... Just like in Vṛndāvana, we... Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa was going to tend the cows and calves of Nanda Mahārāja. There was no education. It can be learned simply by seeing others doing that.

So at the present moment education means many Indians are coming to America to learn how to polish motorcar parts or how to create technology. So this is not education. This is not education. But the Europeans and Americans, they are going to India for learning //brahma-vidya.// That is education. The Europeans and Americans, when they go to Vṛndāvana and Māyāpur, they do not go there to see how we have manufactured cycle and machine for sewing. They have seen enough of this. We may be very proud in India: "Now we are manufacturing cycle and sewing machine or some motor parts, advanced." This is not advanced. Education means how to make one //brāhmaṇa,// how to teach him how he become sense controlled, //śama, dama,// mind control, how to become truthful, how to become clean, how to become simple, how to become full of knowledge, how to apply knowledge in practical life, how to know God. This is education. This is education.

So the present situation of the human civilization is very, very dark, //tamasā.// They want to live in the city without working for producing their food. And there are butchers, they kill innocent animals. And in the city they eat the meat, and to digest they drink and work like hogs and dogs whole day and night. This is civilization. This is not civilization. This is darkness, darkness of life. So we are in the darkness of life at the present moment because it is Kali-yuga, and... The system is always there so long the material world is there and the living entities are fallen in this material world. So they are implicated more or less. So in the Satya-yuga, Tretā-yuga, Dvāpara-yuga, they were not so implicated as they are implicated at this moment, Kali-yuga, because the age of misunderstanding... And the duration of age is also very short. //Prāyeṇa alpa āyuṣaḥ.// In this age people are living not very long. Although the limit is hundred years, nobody is living hundred years. It is reduced, reduced, more and more. In the Kali-yuga the memory will be reduced, the duration of life will be reduced, the strength of the body will be reduced, people's sense of mercifulness will be reduced. In this way there are eight items mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// it will be reduced.

So this is the age of Kali, and we are in darkness, and a mode of life just like animals. So this is our position. But the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, He is sympathetic. He comes, therefore. He comes... He came in the Dvāpara-yuga, by the end of Dvāpara-yuga, and He left behind Him this //Bhagavad-gītā,// being merciful upon these conditioned soul, that "You make your life perfect by reading this //Bhagavad-gītā.// I am leaving behind him. Arjuna is My friend." So in the way of questions or answers and in the way of Arjuna's falling in difficulty... Arjuna was not difficulty. He is personal friend of Kṛṣṇa. But in order to derive the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā,// he showed himself as in ignorance. The benefit is our..., that we have got this //Bhagavad-gītā.// But still, we are so fallen. Because Kṛṣṇa said that //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja,// therefore people misunderstood. Again Kṛṣṇa came in this Kali-yuga as Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya nāmne.// The Rūpa Gosvāmī, he prayed to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //namo mahā-vadānyāya.// Kṛṣṇa came. That's all right. But He was not so liberal. He wanted first of all surrender.

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi...
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

Kṛṣṇa made condition. Kṛṣṇa is personal Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself. He came to show His mercy, and therefore He left //Bhagavad-gītā// to be read by common... Any common man can understand. But the rascals are so rigid that they will misinterpret. Kṛṣṇa left it for reading it by everyone. Any common man can understand. //Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]. This is the beginning. Any common man can understand. The Kurukṣetra is still there, and it is //dharma-kṣetra.// Still people go there to take bath in the Brahma-kunda during lunar and solar eclipse. It is a great //dharma-kṣetra.// But they will interpret, "//Dharma-kṣetra, kuru-kṣetra// means this body." Where they get this meaning? Where is the dictionary? No, because he is scholar, he has invented some meaning. This is going on, and people are misled.

So the time is very, very bad, and even there is attempt to deliver them, they are so rigid and so stubborn, dog obstinacy, they want to remain in the doggish condition of life. It is very, very difficult. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu is so kind. Kṛṣṇa said in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

To understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy thing. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu// After many, many millions of persons, one tries to become //siddha. Siddha// means to understand what he is, //jñāna.// That is //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. And //yatatām api siddhānām...// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. Just like there are two classes of transcendentalist: the Māyāvādī and the Vaiṣṇava. That is all over the world. So Māyāvādī, they are supposed to be //siddhas.// They are not //siddha,// but they are trying to become //siddha,// to understand the spiritual position. //Neti neti:// "I am not this; I am not this; I am not this." But they are not //siddhas. Siddhas,// when they will understand that //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]], when they will understand Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa is everything," //sa mahātmā,// that //mahātmā,// not this ordinary //mahātmā,// "//Nārāyaṇa, namo nārāyaṇa...//" He is ordinary. //Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.// Very rare //mahātmā.// Who is? //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]: "Vasudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is everything." That is //siddha. Siddha.// And again, //yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]].

So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu is very kind, that without considering whether he is a //siddha// or //viddha// or anything else, "Let them take //kṛṣṇa-prema.//" Therefore Rūpa Gosvāmī prayed to Caitanya Mahāprabhu,

> namo mahā-vadānyāya
> kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te
> kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-
> nāmne gaura-tviṣe namaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]

He understood that "Here is Kṛṣṇa, but He has come now in the most liberal way. Everyone He is giving //kṛṣṇa-prema.//" How? "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, dance, and become a lover of Kṛṣṇa." So nice. Simply by chanting and dancing, one is becoming... Practical, it is. All these boys and girls, four or five years ago they did not know who is Kṛṣṇa. That is surprising to everyone. The whole world is praising this movement because they see practically that how these European-American boys and girls are so much, I mean, absorbed in the thought of Kṛṣṇa. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's gift. //Namo mahā-vadānyāya kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te, kṛṣṇāya kṛṣṇa-caitanya-nāmne// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]].

So very simple thing. Don't think I have played something wonder. No, it is not my wonder. The process is wonderful, the process itself. You have to simply accept; then your life will be successful. It is not that "Bhaktivedanta Swami has brought this." They say. They give me the credit. That is my good fortune also. But actually I am just like a peon. I have brought, but I am delivering it without any adulteration. That may be my credit. And if you take it without any adulteration and practice it, then your life is successful. This is the secret of success. Chant, dance, take //prasādam,// live very happily and look very brilliant, and next life go to home, back to Godhead.

So kindly... I am very pleased that you are doing nicely. But don't be proud. Always remain humble, meek, that "I am nothing. I cannot..." That will be nice. And if you think, "Now I have become liberated. I can chant and dance," no, don't think like that. Just like even //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// author, he says, //purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha// [[books:cc:adi:5:205|[Cc. Ādi 5.205]]]: "I am lower than the worm in the stool." //Jagāi mādhāi haite muñi se pāpiṣṭha:// "I am more sinner than Jagāi-Mādhāi." In this way... That is not artificial. A Vaiṣṇava must think like that, that "I am rotten. I have no value." Don't be proud. Then the things will go on nicely. And as soon as you become proud, then //māyā//---"Yes, you are God. Come on. I will kick you on your face. Come on." [chuckles] [laughter] These rascals becomes God, and the //māyā// kicks on the face, and they think that they have become God. Don't become like that. Always remain humble servant, and you will be happy.

Thank you very much.
