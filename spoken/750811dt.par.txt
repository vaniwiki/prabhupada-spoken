**Translation:** Vṛtrāsura was very, very powerful by bodily strength and influence. Now he kept his lower part of the chin on the ground and the other part, the upper part, expanded to the sky. In this way his mouth became very, very big, and his tongue just like big serpent, and at the time of his death he was just trying to chew the whole universe by stealth. This way the great demon Vṛtrāsura, assuming a very, very big body, began to chastise even the mountain, and by his legs he began to dismantle the surface of the earth, as if Himalayan mountain is moving this way. He came before Indra, and thus he swallowed up Indra along with his carrier the elephant, exactly like a big python swallows up a big elephant.

> vṛtrasya dehān niṣkrāntam
> ātma-jyotir arindama
> paśyatāṁ sarva-devānām
> alokaṁ samapadyata
> [[books:sb:6:12:35|[SB 6.12.35]]]

//vṛtrasya//---Vṛtrāsura; //dehāt//---from the body; //niṣkrāntam//---by coming out; //ātma-jyotiḥ//---the spirit soul, as brilliant as the effulgence of Brahmā; //arim-dama//---O the King Parīkṣit, who can subdue his enemies; //paśyatām//---as seen by; //sarva-devānām//---all the demigods; //alokam//---the supreme abode, full of Brahman effulgence; //samapadyata//---he achieved.

**Translation:** O the King Parīkṣit, subduer of enemies, at that time from the body of Vṛtrāsura the spark, a living being, came out, and in order to go back to home, back to Godhead by all the demigods seeing, he entered in the transcendental world to become associate of Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa in the spiritual world.

**Purport:**
Śrīla Viśvanātha CakravartīṬhākura in this way gives an explanation that actually Vṛtrāsura was not killed; Indra was killed. He said that while Vṛtrāsura swallowed up King Indra along with his carrier elephant, certainly he thought, "Now Indra is finished. I have killed Indra, so there is no more use of fighting. Now let me go back to home, back to Godhead." In this way he became situated in trance, stopping his all bodily activities. Taking advantage of the silence of the Lord, Indra came out of the belly, piercing through the abdomen. Because Vṛtrāsura was in trance, it was possible for him to come out. Now Vṛtrāsura was in //yoga-samādhi,// therefore his neck became very, very stiff. Although King Indra wanted to cut his throat, it was so stiff that his thunderbolt took complete 360 days to cut into pieces. Actually, it was the body left by Vṛtrāsura that was cut into pieces by Indra; Vṛtrāsura himself was not killed. He, in his original consciousness, went back to home, back to Godhead, to become associate with Lord Saṅkarṣaṇa. Here //alokam// means the transcendental world, or the Vaikuṇṭhaloka, where Saṅkarṣaṇa resides eternally.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta purport of the Twelfth Chapter, Sixth Canto, of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

Next, Thirteenth Chapter. The summary of the thirteenth chapter is as follows:

In this chapter it is described that Indra was very much afraid of killing a //brāhmaṇa.// Vṛtrāsura was a //brāhmaṇa,// thus he fled from the scene, and how he was saved by the grace of Lord Viṣṇu is described in this chapter.

The story is like this. When all the demigods combined together requested Indra to kill Vṛtrāsura, who was a //brāhmaṇa,// he refused to do it. All the demigods, however, encouraged Indra that he should not be afraid of killing a //brāhmaṇa,// because Indra was being protected by Nārāyaṇa-kavaca, or by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Nārāyaṇa. As such, even by a glimpse of chanting the name of Nārāyaṇa, one becomes free from all the sinful reactions of killing woman, cow, //brāhmaṇa.// So he was advised to perform the sacrifice of //aśvamedha-yajña,// by which Nārāyaṇa is pleased, and as such, the performer of such //yajña// kills the whole universe, he is not implicated with the sinful reaction.

Under this instruction of the demigods, King Indra became engaged in fighting with Vṛtrāsura. However, Vṛtrāsura was killed, everyone became satisfied except King Indra, because he knew what was the position of Vṛtrāsura. This is the nature of great personality. A great personality, even though he acquires illegally some opulence of the world, he remains always ashamed and regretful.

Indra could understand that certainly he was entangled by sinful reaction of killing a //brāhmaṇa.// He could see how the sinful reaction personified was following him backward, and as such he fled out of fear here and there. He began to think of how to get rid of the sinful reaction. In this condition he went to Mānasa-sarovara, and there, being protected by the goddess of fortune, he meditated there for thousands of years. During this time, Nahuṣa reigned..., ruled over the heavenly planets as representative of Indra. Unfortunately, he became attracted by the beauty of Indra's wife, Śacīdevī; therefore on account of this sinful desire he had to accept the body of a serpent next life. In this way Indra later on performed a great fire, taking help from big, big //brāhmaṇas,// saintly persons, and in this way he was relieved from the reaction of sinful life on account of killing a //brāhmaṇa.//
