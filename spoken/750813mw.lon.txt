====== Morning Walk [partially recorded] ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//...ratha// car?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Well, we're thinking of trying again for the permission to get the use of it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Then we'll keep it. No, their objection was that it went..., it jumped the curb; it went out of control at one point, and therefore...

**Prabhupāda:**
That we can rectify. We can make such arrangement it will not jump; it will sit down. [Haṁsadūta laughs] [break] ...don't work.

**Haṁsadūta:**
It can work to take the //ratha// car out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Haṁsadūta:**
We...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Haṁsadūta:**
We always take it off to take the //ratha// car out. [//japa//] [end]
