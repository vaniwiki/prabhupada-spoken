//Viparyaya,// in the reverse condition, unfavorable condition... So...

[children making noise] [aside:] Stop.

**Haṁsadūta:**
The children should go out.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Puruṣa. Puruṣa// means enjoyer, and //prakṛti// means enjoyed, or, in simple word, //puruṣa// means male, and //prakṛti// means female. So this material world is called //prakṛti,// and the living entities who are struggling in this material world to enjoy it, they are called //puruṣa.// Of course, //puruṣa// is Kṛṣṇa only. //Puruṣa// means enjoyer. Nobody is enjoyer, therefore nobody is //puruṣa.// And in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// the living entities have been described also as //prakṛti//---//apareyam itas tv bhinnāṁ me prakṛti..., apareyam itas tv bhinnāṁ me prakṛtiṁ parā//---superior //prakṛti,// not //puruṣa.// But because we are conditioned, we are under illusion. Although we are //prakṛti,// we are thinking that we are //puruṣa.// But actually we are not //puruṣa.// We are also //prakṛti.//

So this living entity, on the false understanding of becoming a //puruṣa,// they have come to this material world to enjoy the material nature.

> kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare
> pāsate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

Just like a male and female. That movement is very strong now in America. The female wants to become male, or equal rights. This is //māyā.// How woman can become in equal with man? Of course, we are not going to study the social welfare activities or something like that, but //puruṣa// and //prakṛti,// they are different. //Purusa// means enjoyer, and //prakṛti// means enjoyed. So here the //prakṛti,// this material nature---earth, water, air, fire, sky, mind, intelligence and ego, egotism---these are eight material things. So in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca, bhinnā prakṛtiṁ me aṣṭadhā// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. These are eight kinds of material energy. Material energy is one, //mahat-tattva,// but they have been divided. //Mahat-tattva,// when it is separated... Just like some philosopher says, "There was a chunk, and it became broken, and the creation took place." This can be applicable... The //mahat-tattva,// the total material energy, by..., when the three //guṇas// break them, they become twenty-four elements---five material, and three material, subtle, and the ten senses, and the ten object of senses. In this way twenty-four elements is become.

So we living entities, we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Just like fire and the small fragments of fire, sparks, our position is like that. Or the sun and the small particles of shining elements combined together becomes the sunshine. The sunshine which we daily see, it is not a homogeneous mixture. There is molecules, very small, shining particle. So we are like that, a very small... As there are atoms, material atoms---nobody can count---similarly, we are atomic sparks of God. How many we are, there is no count. //Asaṅkhyā. Asaṅkhyā// means we cannot count. So many living entities. So we are very small particle, and we have come here in this material world. Just like the Europeans especially, they go to other countries for colonizing to use the material resources for their sense gratification. The America was discovered, and the Europeans went there. The idea was to go there and... Now they are trying to go to the moon planet to find out if there is any convenience. This is the tendency of the conditioned soul.

So they have come to this material world. //Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare// [//Prema-vivarta//]. Means //puruṣa// is //bhoktā. Bhoktā.// Kṛṣṇa is actually //bhoktā. Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. So we are imitating Kṛṣṇa. This is our position. Everyone is trying to become Kṛṣṇa. The Māyāvādīs, although they have undergone penances, austerities---very strictly they follow the principles of spiritual life---but because they are under //māyā,// at the end they are thinking that "I am God, //purusa,//" the same disease, //puruṣa. Purusa// means //bhoktā.// That "I am Kṛṣṇa..." //Bhoktāraṁ yajña...// And even after advancing so much by austerities, penances, following regulative principle, the //māyā// is so strong that still, he is under this impression that "I am //puruṣa.//" Not only ordinary //puruṣa,// but the Supreme //puruṣa,// as Kṛṣṇa is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān, puruṣam śāśvata// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]: "You are //puruṣa.//" So //māyā// is so strong that after being kicked so many lives, life after life, still he is thinking, "I am //puruṣa.// I am enjoyer." This is the disease.

Therefore here it is said that //eṣa prakṛti-saṅgena puruṣasya viparyayaḥ.// His material life begun from this conception, that "I am //puruṣa.// I am enjoyer." And because he cannot give up this idea that "I am enjoyer," life after life he is //viparyayaḥ,// reverse condition. Reverse condition means... Because the living entity is part and parcel of God, and God is //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1], so we are also //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ,// a small //sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ,// but our position is //prakṛti,// not //puruṣa.// Both of them... Just like Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, They are of the same quality. //Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktir asmāt// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]]. They are one, but still, Rādhā is //prakṛti// and Kṛṣṇa is //puruṣa.// Similarly, we are, although part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, but we are //prakṛti// and Kṛṣṇa is //puruṣa.// So by falsely, when we think of becoming //puruṣa,// this is called //māyā// or //viparyayaḥ.// That is stated here. //Evaṁ prakṛti-saṅgena puruṣasya viparyayaḥ. Viparyayaḥ// means he is meant for actually enjoying with the //puruṣa.// When the //puruṣa// and //prakṛti,// male and female, enjoy, they enjoy, they get the same pleasure, but one is //puruṣa;// one is //prakṛti.// Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is //puruṣa,// and we are //prakṛti.// If we enjoy with Kṛṣṇa, then the //ānanda, sac-cid-ānanda,// is there. That we have forgotten. We want to be //puruṣa.// So some way or other, this condition has come into existence, a false conception of becoming //puruṣa,// enjoyer. Then what is the result? The result is that we are trying to be enjoyer life after life, but we are being enjoyed; we are not enjoyer. We are simply struggling to become enjoyer. This is our position.

So how you can stop this struggling and come to your original position? That is stated here, //sa eva na cirād īśa-saṅgād vilīyate.// This false conception of life, that "I am //puruṣa,//" it can be vanquished completely. How? //Īśa-saṅga,// by association with God, //īśa. Īśa// means the supreme controller. //Īśa-saṅga.// "So where is //īśa?// I cannot see //īśa.// I cannot see... Even Kṛṣṇa is //īśa,// the Supreme, but I cannot see Him." Now, Kṛṣṇa is there. You are blind. Why don't you see Him? Therefore you cannot see. So you have to open your eyes, not close. That is the business of //guru.// The //guru// opens the eyes.

> ajñāna-timirāndhasya
> jñānāñjana-śalākayā
> cakṣur unmīlitaṁ yena
> tasmai śrī-gurave namaḥ

So how Kṛṣṇa opens the eyes? By //jñānāñjana-śalākayā.// Just like in the darkness we cannot see anything, but if there is matches or candle, if the candle is ignited, then we can see. Similarly, //guru's// business is to open the eyes. To open the eyes means to give him knowledge that "You are not //puruṣa.// You are //prakṛti.// Change your views." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one is in his original position, that "I am not //bhoktā.// Kṛṣṇa is //bhoktā.// We are helping-beings for enjoyment of Kṛṣṇa. This is our actual position," this is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore //īśa-saṅgāt,// "by association with Bhagavān." So in this condition, when I am so much fallen, how I can associate with Kṛṣṇa? So that is //īśa-saṅgāt. Īśa// is absolute. Everything has emanated from //īśa,// God. So in that way everything is //īśa.// There is nothing but //īśa,// but we haven't got the eyes to see. //Antar-bahir-avasthitaḥ// [[books:sb:1:8:18|[SB 1.8.18]]]. Kuntī said, "My dear Kṛṣṇa, You are situated outside and inside. Still, we are so rascal, we cannot see You." We cannot see You. How we can see? //Īśa-saṅgāt,// association. //Saṅgāt sanjāyate kāmaḥ.//

So with whom associate? Now, //īśa.// These are... //Īśa// means His name, His form, His attributes, His..., so many things. You see? //Nāma, rūpa, rasa//---everything is //īśa.// So this temple means to give chance to people for associating with //īśa,// with Kṛṣṇa. So therefore, according to Vedic civilization, everyone is advised to go to the temple. Still people are going to the church, to the temple, to the mosque, to the synagogue. Why? //Īśa-saṅgāt, īśa-saṅgāt,// just to associate with God. That is the purpose. So if you actually search after //īśa,// Kṛṣṇa, or God, you can get it. There is arrangement. Just like this temple. This temple, if you come, if you make association with this temple, immediately you will be benefited by hearing the glories of the Lord, this, every subject matter pertaining to God. We are reading //Bhāgavatam// or //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is also //īśa.// Because these are the words of //īśa,// therefore, //īśa// being absolute, there is no difference between His words and Him. Kṛṣṇa, five thousand years ago, He spoke //Bhagavad-gītā.// That //Bhagavad-gītā// is the same //Bhagavad-gītā// which He spoke five thousand years ago, and it is not different from Kṛṣṇa, because Kṛṣṇa is absolute. Whatever His words, His form, His name, His quality, everything, His temple, His activities, His books---everything //īśa.//

So if we associate with all these things, //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]], hearing and chanting about Viṣṇu, then this misconception of life, that "I am //puruṣa,//" will vanquish. Then you become liberated. //Īśa-saṅgād vilīyate.// So take chance of this //īśa-saṅga// very vigorously. //Tivreṇa bhakti-yogena// [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]. That is recommended. Anyone who is... There are two classes of men. One class of men, they are trying to enjoy this material world. Another class of men, they are rejecting---//brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā//---Māyāvādī. They say, "We have no use for this material world." And the //karmīs...// Those who are rejecting, they are //jñānis.// And those who are //karmīs,// they want more material enjoyment, more money, more money, more assets. The two classes of men. But a devotee is neither this class or that class. A devotee is neither //karmī// nor //jñāni.// Therefore //bhakti// means //jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. If one is involved in //jñāna// and //karma// he cannot become //bhakta.//

//Bhakta// means //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. The //bhakta// has nothing to do with this //jñāna// and //karma. Jñāna// means to understand. So you understand simply that "I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead," then your //jñāna// is full. Your knowledge is full. These two words, that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and I am Kṛṣṇa's part and parcel," if we realize these things only, then our //jñāna,// our knowledge, is perfect. And then, as soon as knowledge is perfect, then next is //vairāgya. Jñāna-vairāgya-yuktayā// [[books:sb:1:2:12|[SB 1.2.12]]]. Two things required. But if you remain in the //jñāna// platform, do not come to the actual spiritual platform, then //śrama eva hi kevalam// [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]. It is simply waste of... //Jñāna// means to have knowledge. What knowledge? This knowledge, that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person, //bhoktā, puruṣa,// and we are just part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa to fulfill the desire of Kṛṣṇa." This is //jñāna.// Just like the hand is part and parcel of my body, so what is the duty of this hand? The duty is to fulfill the desire of the person. Similarly, we are part and parcel of God, or Kṛṣṇa. Our only business is to fulfill the desire of Kṛṣṇa, not to fulfill our desire. That is... That is not //bhakti.// That is //jñāna// or //karma.// But fulfill the desire of Kṛṣṇa, that is //bhakti. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttama// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. This is first-class //bhakti.//

So this philosophy is spoken by the Yamadūta, that one has become conditioned on this false conception of life, that "I am //puruṣa.//" But this misconception can be vanquished. It is not very easy to vanquish, but it can be. How? //Īśa-saṅga.// Associate with Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, and you will be able to give up this false misconception of life. The whole world, material world, is going on. You can see any city, any big town you go, or even in the village in these countries, everyone, from the morning to night, they are simply trying how to enjoy the material world: "How to enjoy? How to enjoy?" This is called //karma-jñāna.// When they are fed up, then "The grapes are sour." They give up: //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.// But that will not stay. If you... Even if you give up for the time being, that //jagat mithyā//---"We have no business with the //jagat//"---it may be sentimentally enduring for some time, but because you are not purified, therefore //Bhāgavata// says, //ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. Simply to understand that "I am not this material body, so I have nothing to do with this body, and I am spirit soul," simply this much knowledge is not perfect.

Therefore sometimes the Māyāvādīs, they think, "Now we have understood that I am not this body. I have nothing to do with the material world. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi:// I am Brahman," but they do not understand the Supreme Brahman, Para-brahman, Kṛṣṇa. They do not understand. Therefore //śāstra// says, //ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ.// Because they have understood what is the difference between spirit and matter, that knowledge is not perfect. //He aravindākṣa. Anye.// They are thinking, "Now we have understood what is spirit and what... Therefore we are liberated. We are the... //Aham. So 'ham:// I have become the same." So for them the //śāstra// says, //ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas tvayy asta-bhāvād// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. //Tvayy// means "unto You, Kṛṣṇa." They have not understood yet what is Kṛṣṇa, the //puruṣa,// the supreme //puruṣa. Tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.// Therefore their intelligence is not yet clear. Simply understanding that "I am not this material body; I am spirit soul," is not sufficient, because unless you come to the point to understand Kṛṣṇa, this will not stand.

Therefore many //sannyāsīs,// they give up the //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.// I mean to... Māyāvādī //sannyāsī.// Again they fall down in this //mithyā jagat.// They come for political work, they come for social work, //daridra-nārāyaṇa-seva// and this and that. That's all. Because they are not pure. If //jagat// is //mithyā,// why you again so much anxious for serving the //jagat?// This misconception is going on. Everyone asks us that "Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, why not serve the suffering humanity?" They say always. And what you can do? You are... Simply like a madman you are thinking that you can serve the humanity. You cannot serve the humanity. You have no such power. What you can do? The example was... I was giving that if you want to give help a suffering in disease man, and bring some nice doctor, medical man to help him and bring some nice medicine, that is good work, but does it mean that it is guaranteed that he will be cured? No. Therefore you cannot do anything. You may think like that. Or you may act like that. But unless the Supreme Person sanctions, you cannot do anything. One is, I mean, sure to suffer the material pangs of life. Nobody can stop it. So therefore we should not try. It will be automatically tried.

Just like we are distributing //prasādam.// Not that because he is poor man and we are giving //prasāda.// No. This is not our idea. To our eyes, the so-called poor man and rich man, they are all suffering, not that the simply poor man suffering and the rich man is not suffering. Therefore we give them //prasādam// or //īśa-saṅga.// That //prasādam// is also //īśa.// The //prasādam// accepted by Kṛṣṇa, offered to Kṛṣṇa, is also Kṛṣṇa. So if we give //prasādam,// then he is getting the opportunity of associating with Kṛṣṇa. This is our idea. But people very much appreciate poor-feeding. So that, you can take it, that. But everyone is poor. Who is rich? Unless one has got knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, he is poor. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. So-called knowledge has no value. Therefore a //jñānavān,// a man of knowledge, after many, many births he comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. So this is the process. //Īśa-saṅgāt.// So this //prasāda// distribution means giving chance to the people, those who are poor in knowledge, to awaken their Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is our policy. Otherwise, we cannot do any good to any others.

//Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sar...// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. Everyone is going on under the stringent laws of material nature. We cannot help. The same example: if a man is diseased, you can try to bring to him nice physician, nice medicine, but that is not guarantee that he will be cured. That depends on Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate, I mean to say, beneficiary, or benevolent. Kṛṣṇa is the ultimate bene... If He likes, He can. So take Kṛṣṇa's shelter, and whatever He likes, accept that. This is full surrender. Just like Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura:

> mānasa deha geha, yo kichu mora,
> arpilūn tuwā pade nanda-kiśora

"Nanda-kiśora, what I have got? I have got this body, and I have got some mental speculation, and maybe I have got some house and family. So everything I surrender unto You." This is called full surrender.

> mānasa deha geha, yo kichu mora,
> arpilūn tuwā pade nanda-kiśora

That is wanted. If we can do that, then we shall be happy. Otherwise there is no question of happiness. //Viparyayaḥ:// always reverse condition, miserable condition.

Thank you very much.
