====== Morning Walk ======

**Brahmānanda:**
...six and 1975 is seventy-nine years?

**Prabhupāda:**
Seventy-nine complete. Now, from first September, eightieth begins. Beginning eightieth. The age is taken... So we are not going to... Where?

**Harikeśa:**
Actually we don't know. [shouting] Get Tejiyas. Where is Tejiyas?

**Devotee (1):**
He's coming now.

**Brahmānanda:**
There's some park near here, he said? Indian gate?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. He said we shall go to Indian Gate?

**Harikeśa:**
Where you usually go?

**Prabhupāda:**
Is there any car?

**Harikeśa:**
Is there a car?

**Brahmānanda:**
There's no car.

**Jayapatāka:**
He said he knew a short walk.

**Harikeśa:**
[shouting] Where is Tejiyas? Tejiyas. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that house?

**Brahmānanda:**
They couldn't contact the man yesterday, so they did not see it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The daughter rises early in the morning? Your daughter?

**Madira:**
Yes. She comes to //maṅgala-ārati// every day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That's nice. Good qualification.

**Harikeśa:**
Is there a fan? A fan? A fan.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Brahmānanda:**
He wanted one fan.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fan? No.

**Harikeśa:**
The reason is flies. They're terrible. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...Śrīla Prabhupāda, the deputy director of tourism of the government of West Bengal came out to visit Māyāpur. He said that many people have been wanting to see Māyāpur and Navadvipa, and the nearest guesthouse they have is Berhampur. They have a guesthouse at Berhampur. So they wanted to know the possibility if a bus of twenty-four people could use our guesthouse. They offered thirty rupees a night per room and said that normally they pay six rupees per meal. People... They wouldn't smoke or break any rules while they go in the building.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. Let them come. So in one room, one person?

**Jayapatāka:**
Two people. Double room.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thirty-two rupees?

**Jayapatāka:**
Thirty rupees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thirty rupees. And meals?

**Jayapatāka:**
Six rupees a meal they are accustomed to pay.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's very nice.

**Jayapatāka:**
Either rice, //ḍāl// and...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Cāpāṭi.//

**Jayapatāka:**
And //sabjī.// Otherwise //purī// and //sabjī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. Why not begin immediately?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes.

**Bhāgavata:**
Also that other man approached, that [indistinct]?

**Jayapatāka:**
Of course, that... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...self-independent, or self-dependent.

**Bhāgavata:**
If we build up enough trade, tourist trade, like that in the guesthouse, then Māyāpur can maintain itself very easily.

**Prabhupāda:**
So do it. [break] ...of the modern civilization, they are thinking that having such nice house, nice motorcar, nice road, nice machine, nice dress, nice woman, they will be happy. This is advancement of civilization. "What is this? Don't drink, don't smoke, no meat, simply denying, denying?" This is civilization. They think "This is practical. And after death who is going to take care?"

//Bhasmī-bhutasya dehasya kutaḥ punar-āgamano bhavet// [Cārvāka Muni]: "When the body is finished, burning into ashes, who is coming and who is responsible?" This is atheistic civilization. [break] //...artha-maninaḥ.// External energy, that is everything. Within the body there is the soul---they deny it. There is no soul, body is everything, and enjoy bodily enjoyment. That's all. And our philosophy immediately condemns, that "Anyone who is in the bodily concept of life, he is //sa eva go-kharaḥ// [SB 10.84.13]; he is animal." So this is a park?

**Indian man:**
A small park.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's a lot of parks of this type.

**Prabhupāda:**
India Gate? No.

**Tejiyas:**
India Gate is this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. You have to go this side or this side?

**Tejiyas:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ravindra Thakur?

**Tejiyas:**
Ravindra Bhavan.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I sold my books here. When I was alone, I was selling books.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You would go to different libraries and colleges?

**Prabhupāda:**
Especially colleges and libraries. Everyone was taking.

**Bhāgavata:**
Even the prime minister, Lal Bahadur Sastri, you gave him book.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. He was good man.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He was very religious. I think if he would have been there today, we would have had no problems.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] He could not solve his own problem. [break] ...court? No.

**Tejiyas:**
This is Mandi House.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Tejiyas:**
Mandi House.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mandi House means?

**Tejiyas:**
Mahārāja of Mandi.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now it's government...

**Tejiyas:**
Now it's a television studio.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rajouri Garden, they are serious about?

**Tejiyas:**
He is serious. This morning I will go there, because I tried to contact them yesterday and was not able to. We will go first thing this morning, after we come back. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
You put forth such new, I think. It was not before. But they have supplied so rotten materials.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Breaking. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...class in the temple?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
At what time?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually the class, the morning class, is over, but we can... Delhi has a different schedule there.

**Brahmānanda:**
Class is at five o'clock.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's a //Bhagavad-gītā// class in the evening.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this building?

**Tejiyas:**
This is Ayana Bhavan. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Balarāma's. So fasting.

**Tejiyas:**
Yes. Till noon?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Then a feast?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [break] [indistinct] Who is he?

**Brahmānanda:**
He's some Italian astronomer. What did he...? Oh, he invented the telescope.

**Prabhupāda:**
Invented telescope?

**Brahmānanda:**
So they could speculate about the stars and planets. [break]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...all the British names out and replaced them with Italian and Indian and other names.

**Tejiyas:**
Many Muslim names they have replaced also. Because they are supposed to be historical figures. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the road. This is the bus. [break]

**Tejiyas:**
Many of the members are reading the books now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. One man, he is coming tonight, he has read your //Bhagavad-gītā// six times now. He is very enthusiastic. Now he is thinking that he has wasted his whole life. That's the way he talks.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. If he comes to that conclusion, then he becomes perfect.

**Tejiyas:**
He told me, "I have read so many //Bhagavad-gītās// previously, but never was the commentation clear. I could not understand the meaning."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They simply jugglery of words.

**Tejiyas:**
He said, "All impersonal."

**Bhāgavata:**
There was one man in Calcutta, you stayed in his house just before you left for America, and later he became a //sannyāsī.// He sings //bhajanas.// He became a //sannyāsī// later. He knew you very well. You had written him a letter. And he just recently became a patron, and he is reading your books now also. I have forgotten his name, but he knew you very, very well. He used to sing //bhajanas.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...dranatha statue? [break] ...some contribution through that... What is that temple? No, no. Chandni Chowk?

**Tejiyas:**
//Ācchā.// Gauri Shankar.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gauri Shankar. I think, that Sita Ram? Sita Ram? He is living or not?

**Tejiyas:**
Which Sita Ram?

**Prabhupāda:**
He is one Mr. Sita Ram. He was secretary. Sita Ram barrister.

**Tejiyas:**
I don't know him.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he introduced me there, and they agreed to pay me 1,500.

**Tejiyas:**
For the books.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. For some paper.

**Tejiyas:**
He is friends with Bim Sen, but he is not like Bim Sen. He's a different bird.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bim Sen? [dogs barking]

**Tejiyas:**
He's associated with Bim Sen in some projects.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is Bim Sen?

**Tejiyas:**
Bim Sen, he comes with the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So sweetmeat market?

**Tejiyas:**
Yes. That sweetmeat market. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...was a Hindu minister, chief minister of Akbar. Emperor Akbar, his chief minister was Todar Mal.

**Tejiyas:**
Babar was also a minister of his?

**Prabhupāda:**
Babar was father of Akbar, Babar.

**Tejiyas:**
These are all Muslim names here.

**Prabhupāda:**
It was Muslim kingdom. Todar Mal is Hindu. The Muslim emperor, they used to employ Hindus as chief of department.

**Tejiyas:**
Like Rūpa Gosvāmī and...

**Prabhupāda:**
They did not believe Muslims to become the chief. They knew it very well that these Muslims are not reliable. They can kill their father even. [end]
