====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So //parikramā// path, this way?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This way. Śrīla Prabhupāda, it's this way, the //parikramā.// [break] ...the best land for our purposes, because the children can just run back and forth.

**Child:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda!

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.//

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...completed in one month. Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's a sign over here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That's nice. //Jaya.// This is also lying vacant?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we are... [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya. Haribol. Jaya.//

**Dhanañjaya:**
This is lying vacant also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whose land it is?

**Dhanañjaya:**
This is a part of the Christian land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Christian land.

**Jayapatāka:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, walk on the right.

**Dhanañjaya:**
So the Christians, they own about... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So what they are doing?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Well, Praṇava, he was investigating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Investigating for life. Whole life, simply investigating.

**Dhanañjaya:**
But now, since the rains have been here, this whole countryside has become very, very green. It seems like the land is very fertile. Grass is growing so profusely like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Arrange a meeting with the D.M.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes. Mr. Bagla, the D.M.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I've heard he wants to see the film very badly. He wants to see our Hare Kṛṣṇa film, the D.M. So we are waiting for it from Delhi, and...

**Dhanañjaya:**
It is coming this morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. D.M. is coming?

**Dhanañjaya:**
No. The film is coming this morning.

**Devotee (1):**
There's a cart.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The D.M. heard that Indira Gandhi saw the film. So now he wants to see it now.

**Brahmānanda:**
So there's so much talk going on now. So now he wants to see the film.

**Prabhupāda:**
So then he will come.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And then we shall give him good refreshment.

**Bhāgavata:**
The assistant chief of police from Mathurā has booked the V.I.P. room for the 29th and 30th of this month.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
For whom?

**Bhāgavata:**
For himself and his family. He wants to stay in the V.I.P. room for two days. He booked about a week ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
For Janmāṣṭamī.

**Bhāgavata:**
Yes, for Janmāṣṭamī he wants to stay.

**Brahmānanda:**
For free?

**Bhāgavata:**
No, no.

**Brahmānanda:**
He'll pay?

**Bhāgavata:**
Yes.

**Gurṇārṇava:**
Of course, he's going to pay.

**Prabhupāda:**
V.I.P. room, our?

**Bhāgavata:**
Yes. Our V.I.P. room.

**Brahmānanda:**
What is the charges for the V.I.P. room?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Twenty rupees. All this land between Chattikara Road and Pagala Baba's //āśrama, mandir,// is very good for cultivation.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who does it belong to? Different farms?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes. And government.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which way we shall go?

**Gurṇārṇava:**
Which way shall we go?

**Prabhupāda:**
This way or that? Which way? Nobody can say?

**Dhanañjaya:**
This is the //parikramā.// [pause] This path is here, better.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let us go this way. [break] ...Bon Mahārāja's land? No.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Not all. This fence...

**Brahmānanda:**
That's his building there?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes. He has 28 acres of land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where? He has altogether 83 acres...

**Dhanañjaya:**
Eighty-three?

**Prabhupāda:**
...so far I know. What is this? [break] ...this way, this way, from back side. Then?

**Gurṇārṇava:**
They're always taking. Should be [indistinct]. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...going on in that Pagala //āśrama?//

**Gurṇārṇava:**
Very slow.

**Dhanañjaya:**
They say another five years before it's finished.

**Prabhupāda:**
By that time he may be finished.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I have heard he's a chain smoker.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Gurṇārṇava:**
Yeah, he is.

**Prabhupāda:**
And the Marwaris are after him, "//avatāra.//" He is called "//līlā-avatāra.//"

**Dhanañjaya:**
//Līlā-avatāra.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever he does, it is //līlā.// Smoking is also //līlā.// [break] ...these cottages?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Some //sādhus// live here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Vṛndāvana resident:**
//Jaya Sītā-Rāma!//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// [break] ...Bon Mahārāja's land?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
This is his land?

**Dhanañjaya:**
This is his building, part of land.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we shall have to go back from this way, or there is another way?

**Harikeśa:**
There's a path up here that goes straight across Bon Mahārāja's land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
...all this has subsided. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...and did he?

**Dhanañjaya:**
We will find out.

**Prabhupāda:**
So much land is vacant here.

**Brahmānanda:**
What are these plants here? Are these farmers? [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
...much more available here.

**Dhanañjaya:**
And the soil is such good quality. Everything is growing. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...land belongs to somebody because it is barbed wire.

**Brahmānanda:**
Very nice fencing here.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] ...this //janglee.//[?]

**Jayapatāka:**
They make oil from this now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Castor seed?

**Jayapatāka:**
//Kusuma// or something like that, I think. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Whose farm this is?

**Dhanañjaya:**
This is Akhandananda Swami. Akhandananda Mahārāja. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...just straight or return back?

**Brahmānanda:**
Where is that path, Harikeśa?

**Gurṇārṇava:**
The path is just ahead.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Just goes around like this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Here all Bon Mahārāja's land? No.

**Woman:**
//Jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Dhanañjaya:**
That we must find out.

**Jayapatāka:**
You go to the settlement office and you ask for information sheet. Then you can find all this. Get a map, and then for each plot ask for information sheet. One rupee for five names. [//kīrtana// in background] [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
Sītā-Rāma.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Sītā-Rāma.

**Dhanañjaya:**
They've been chanting for sixty years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sixty years? Continually?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
We have no worker. That is the... So even if we secure land, if there is no worker, what is the use? All this land is not being worked on. No work prepared. [break] ...Bon Mahārāja's tombs?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...maṭha.//

**Gurṇārṇava:**
What are the inscriptions?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dvaitādvaita,// I think. Nimbārka philosophy.

**Brahmānanda:**
What are these things? Gates or something?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, philosophy. They wanted to make it Vaiṣṇava philosophy anyway. So these are different...

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh. //Sampradāyas?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, of Vaiṣṇava. [break] ...to anyone, neither he will do anything. [break]

**Dhanañjaya:**
...Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody's taking care.

**Harikeśa:**
They make it clear across.

**Prabhupāda:**
In this place it is closed with wall?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes. Formerly there was no wall.

**Harikeśa:**
No, there was no wall.

**Brahmānanda:**
Not a brick wall.

**Dhanañjaya:**
[indistinct] That is no...

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The college is closed?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Summer vacation. Actually, the principal of the college, he has more say in the running of the college than Bon Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Brahmānanda:**
He dictates.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many students are in this college?

**Prabhupāda:**
When he comes, Bon Mahārāja, here?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Well, yesterday we went to see, but he is suffering from bronchitis and a fever. He was lying in his bed.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He looked quite sick.

**Brahmānanda:**
You saw him?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's what they said. [indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...teachers' quarter? No.

**Harikeśa:**
This is that part of Agra University. This belongs to Agra University.

**Prabhupāda:**
Agra U...?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Not belonging. It's affiliated, affiliated to Agra University, but it's belonging to this board of trustees who operate the college. The land is belonging to Bon Mahārāja, but the board of trustees, they control the activities of the Institute. Actually, it's no different from the...

**Prabhupāda:**
So this building for the board of...

**Devotee (1):**
These are for studying science, politics, geography, economics and so on. It's just like any other college. There is no Oriental philosophy being studied. There is only one student who is actually studying philosophy in the whole college, Vaiṣṇava philosophy. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...Fogla //āśrama?//

**Gurṇārṇava:**
Fogla //āśrama// is further down, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this //āśrama?//

**Dhanañjaya:**
This is no //āśrama,// Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's just houses.

**Gurṇārṇava:**
Just houses.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just house? Oh. Nobody is living?

**Gurṇārṇava:**
Yes, they're living.

**Prabhupāda:**
[to a passerby:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [Bengali]

**Jayapatāka:**
It seems that when the schools allow the outside teachers in, then it falls down.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Jayapatāka:**
When the schools allow outside professional teachers into the institutions, then they seem to go down.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, immediately.

**Jayapatāka:**
I was investigating in West Bengal. So long as you have your own teachers and you don't take any aid from them, then all they have to do is see that your grounds are up to the..., buildings are up to the standard. They don't have much say.

**Prabhupāda:**
That we want. //Jaya.// [//kīrtana// in background]

**Brahmānanda:**
There is still fifteen minutes, Prabhupāda, before the curtains open.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we can begin our...

**Dhanañjaya:**
7:30 [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Curtain opens?

**Dhanañjaya:**
The gates open at 7:30.

**Harikeśa:**
7:30?

**Dhanañjaya:**
In forty minutes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So we can have our other function?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Yes, //Bhāgavatam// class.

**Harikeśa:**
//Guru-pūjā?//

**Dhanañjaya:**
//Guru-pūjā.// [break] [end]
