====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...sometimes they do not. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...cows are all becoming devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is preaching.

[to passerby:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [break] ...not like that. On the head. The Sarasvatī's //mandir// will be...

**Brahmānanda:**
Ready?

**Prabhupāda:**
For the last three years I am seeing. [break] //...maṭha// commander. Hmm?

**Brahmānanda:**
Who is the temple commander?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Hari-śauri. His name is Hari-śauri.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is sleeping? He does not see?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. I am considering to become the temple commander myself, because it's not the first time this has happened. So many things have gone wrong. Too many. So I think I will do it myself.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then? You will be everything.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Because I cannot find anyone more suitable, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
And he is the suitable man. [break] [Hindi]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Tell him that we had heard he had come and you are free now, so he can... Tell him what time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? He went there?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, yesterday. No. Saccidānanda went. [break] ...did not know whether he could come or not. [break]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...celebration there. The education minister is also coming. He is going to be the chief guest. So we are going to have this time two big ministers coming to our Janmāṣṭamī //paṇḍāl.//

**Dhanañjaya:**
Should we hold an //abhiṣekha// ceremony for Janmāṣṭamī?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You know what is //abhiṣeka// ceremony?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Bathing ceremony.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Dhanañjaya:**
Should we bathe only the small Kṛṣṇa Deity?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...bathe.

**Brahmānanda:**
How will you bathe?

**Dhanañjaya:**
Well, the ceremony would begin about ten in the evening, and we would bathe with water, //ghee,// honey, yogurt.

**Indian man:**
Mahārāj-jī

**Prabhupāda:**
//Namaskāra.// [Hindi conversation] [break] We shall go. How many? Four? Five?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Four, five. Should we have small //kīrtana// there also?

**Brahmānanda:**
If we have //kīrtana,// we shall have to bring more men.

**Prabhupāda:**
As they will send car.

**Brahmānanda:**
Well they've sent, as far as I know, one car. So besides yourself, then three others could go. Maybe four.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But it's so near that we can [indistinct]. [break] Jayapatāka is taking quotes over there, and he'll... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Offset you can take. It will be very cheap.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, true. And also then next time we want to reprint it, we can just reprint. It doesn't have to be composed again. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
You give me simply hot milk with //miṣṭi.// [break] They're going to foreign country, but once they go, they become disappointed and not second time.

**Brahmānanda:**
Someone has gone?

**Prabhupāda:**
So many.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Even this man has gone to Hong Kong.

**Brahmānanda:**
Really?

**Prabhupāda:**
They generally go to this Middle East, it is called. No?

**Brahmānanda:**
Far East.

**Prabhupāda:**
Far East, yes. Because there are many Indians.

**Dhanañjaya:**
They also go to London.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, not London. In London the //kathā vāca,// they go, //Rāmāyaṇa// of Tulsidas.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Tulsidas's teaching bona fide, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
He is not pure Vaiṣṇava. He has got Māyāvādī touch. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...Swami from Bombay, his program is to go all around the world and to install the //Vedas// in Sanskrit.

**Prabhupāda:**
That he tried, and he failed.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Ninety-four-year-old swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gaṅgeśvarānanda.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Gaṅgeśvara. I've heard he likes us very much. Girirāja told me in Bombay that he likes us.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is very favorable to our movement.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's a Māyāvādī, but he seems to have a lot of followers amongst the Indians.

**Brahmānanda:**
Damodar Chanrai follows him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Damodar?

**Brahmānanda:**
Damodar Chanrai from Nigeria.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He was in Nigeria recently.

**Brahmānanda:**
He follows him.

**Passerby:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa!

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [Hindi] Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that if somebody remembers Kṛṣṇa by seeing somebody, that somebody is Vaiṣṇava. He remembers immediately Kṛṣṇa.

**Brahmānanda:**
That's a test.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the test. [break]

**Akṣayānanda:**
...just now, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was handed some leaflets, Chinmayananda Swami, and the printed advertisement on the leaflet wanted "Young men with graduation degree to come to our institute in Bombay. They will be trained up in Sanskrit..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Akṣayānanda:**
"To be trained in Sanskrit and philosophy. Then they will be selected by Chinmayananda for preaching all over the world. And if they qualify, then all their expenses and food and clothing will be supplied by the Chinmayananda Mission." Advertisement.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This appeared in //Times of India.// It's only in Bombay. It also appeared in //Times of India// in [indistinct]. It was an ad just like a professional company's ad.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody will be attracted.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They are trying to attract people that they'll get a chance to go abroad.

**Prabhupāda:**
That may be allurement.

**Brahmānanda:**
Actually, by placing such an ad, then all the wealthy people read the ad in the newspaper, and they think, "Oh, they are doing such nice work." So then they go and collect, and they say, "Oh, you see? We are placing the ads." So on the basis of the ad alone.

**Akṣayānanda:**
That means there is no work.

**Prabhupāda:**
But no educated man, at least in India, is interested any more with philosophy and preaching. No Indian. [aside:] //Jaya.// [break]

**Akṣayānanda:**
...preach more, then that would help? Because he was previously a principal of a school.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, how he is preaching? Have you heard? No, you cannot understand in Hindi.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Hindi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyone?

**Dhanañjaya:**
We've been told he preaches nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have told him that "You simply read my books and reproduce it. That's all. That will be preaching."

**Akṣayānanda:**
At least when he speaks to me in English, it's always very nice.

**Brahmānanda:**
He can memorize Prabhupāda's books and then just speak it.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Exactly.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is preaching.

**Akṣayānanda:**
As we do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Our process is //anuśṛṇuyāt.// We hear from the superior and reproduce it. That is //śravaṇaṁ-kīrtanam.// Then perfect. If I add something my own imagination, then it will spoil. No addition, alteration; as it is. As it is you hear from your spiritual master, reproduce. That's all. //Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. This //'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa// is coming by //paramparā,// so you reproduce, that's all. Even a child can reproduce what he has heard from his father. It is not at all difficult. [break] ...cheap rate.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. What we can also do is... I think we should have some publication for one rupee twenty-five paisa. We can just print a small ten-page or ten- or fifteen-page.

**Prabhupāda:**
What you'll explain in ten or fifteen page?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Otherwise all these books, they cost us about 1.40 for printing.

**Brahmānanda:**
That Hanuman Prasad Poddar, he was producing big books at cheap rates.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They were all subsidized by Rama..., all his books. And he had no profit.

**Harikeśa:**
Also the paper is given free by Samani.

**Prabhupāda:**
No... Yes. They were receiving contribution. Besides that, he possessed agency of Titagarh paper mill. So mill rate---immediately 33% less.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And I heard all his books were heavily subsidized by Dalmia.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. Dalmia and many big, big Marwaris.

**Harikeśa:**
Maybe they can produce your Hindi lectures in pamphlets.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if... You can make it cheaper. Instead of three rupees, you can make it two rupees.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Like we can have four or five of your lectures for one small book for one rupee, fifty paisa, or one rupee and... If somebody can't afford two rupees... At the present moment we are selling your //Back to Godhead// for two rupees. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...educated, he appreciated it.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He wants to become your disciple.

**Akṣayānanda:**
What if the Hindi //Back to Godhead// was in newspaper form? Would that be lowering the standard?

**Brahmānanda:**
Then they'd throw it away.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You can't have a color picture then.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Akṣayānanda:**
If it was in newspaper form, that would be lowering the standard too much, the Hindi //Back to Godhead.// Then they will throw it away?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Like we have those...

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We don't have a color cover, then...

**Prabhupāda:**
We must have quality. Our Godbrothers, they publish tenth-quality papers. Nobody... Nobody cares.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Madras we are printing a big Tamil //Īśopaniṣad,// and one Sindhi man, he has donated eight thousand towards the cost. The total cost is eleven thousand, and he has donated about eight thousand.

**Prabhupāda:**
In this way...

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If we can get this... One way we can reduce our cost is by getting advertisements.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But that you wish not to do. You'd rather...

**Brahmānanda:**
Just like this other man has agreed to subsidize the Arabic book?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He will pay for the whole thing, not just subsidize.

**Brahmānanda:**
So, so many can be gotten in this way. If they see the books are coming, then they will want to... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...man is convinced, then our printing of books shall be success. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]].

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We will have thousands of people convinced. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācāryopāsanam.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā:// "One should worship //ācārya.//" This is the beginning of spiritual life. //Amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam ācāryopāsanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.8]]]. //Ācāryavān puruṣo veda// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 6.14.2]. These are the injunction. Without taking shelter of //ācārya,// nobody can understand anything. [break] ...wants //prasāda,// it is not given?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes. Given.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not given. [break]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...women's. They try and harass us, they try and cheat us.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?//

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes. Nirnaiyika just wanted to use their scale, and they would try and cheat him. They would ask him for money just to let us use their scale to weigh the vegetables we buy. And so I intervened one day, and then he got so angry that he abused Kṛṣṇa also. These are such big demons, these people. They live in Vṛndāvana, but...

**Prabhupāda:**
So give them //prasāda;// they will be all right. Yes. Give them //prasāda.//

**Harikeśa:**
The perfect solution.

**Brahmānanda:**
We were also demons before we took //prasāda.// [laughter]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// Our preaching means to turn demons into devotees. That is our preaching. If you keep them demon, then your preaching is lacking.

[//Govindam// recording playing in background]

Give them //prasādam// today and tell them, "Whenever you come, take //prasāda.//" [end]
