So this is the beginning of //saṁsāra.// So there is attraction between man and woman, and as soon as the attraction becomes little intimate, they unite. Then they have children. Then they require money, apartment, so many things.

This man became sinful. He gave up his real wife, married wife, coming from very good family, but he became attracted with that //śūdrāṇī,// fourth class. //Śūdra// means fourth class, worker class. //Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// So //śūdra// women, they are not chaste. Some of them are practically professional prostitute. But that is not in higher caste family---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya.// But at the present moment it is very difficult to distinguish who is //brāhmaṇa// and who is //śūdra.// But formerly this is the system of Vedic civilization---ideal character, ideal behavior of the //brāhmaṇa;// less, little less, //kṣatriya;// little less, //vaiśya;// and less than the //vaiśya,// the //śūdra;// and less than the //śūdras// are called //caṇḍālas.// First class, second class, third class, fourth class and then fifth class.

So this man, being attracted with the //śūdrāṇī,// naturally there was children. So he began to maintain them. This is natural affection. Even cats and dogs, they maintain their children. The birds also, they maintain their kiddies. So although children were born of //śūdrāṇī,// natural there was affection. So he required money. But he became sinful; he could not earn money honestly. A sinful man cannot earn money honestly. Just like a thief: because he has adopted the means of earning money by sinful activities, he cannot take to honest work. He can work, but he is accustomed to steal. He knows that "This work is not good." If he is arrested, he will be punished. He has seen that one thief arrested and punished, and he has heard also that if one steals, he will be punished. And he has heard also from the //śāstra,// either law book or Vedic literature, that "Stealing is not good. It is punishable." But still, he does it. That means a sinful man cannot restrain himself from sinful activity. He has to do it. //Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo asya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]. Unless you give up the particular association with the modes of nature, it is not possible for him to restrain himself from committing sinful activities.

So he became sinful because he left his married wife and he became attracted with a //śūdrāṇī// immediately. That has been described in the previous verse, //visasarjācirāt pāpaḥ// [[books:sb:6:1:65|[SB 6.1.65]]]. //Pāpaḥ// means sinful man. He became sinful immediately. Therefore we stress on marriage. They cannot understand why this Association stresses so much for marriage, not to live... They live as friend; that is //śūdra.// There is no legal marriage, //śūdra// and //śūdrāṇī.// Just like he was living with the //śūdrāṇī//---he was not married---as friend. So even //śūdra's// marriage there is. For the //śūdra// there is one //āśrama//---that is //gṛhastha āśrama.// And for the //brāhmaṇas,// four //āśramas: brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.// This is for the //brāhmaṇas.// For the //kṣatriyas: brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha.// For the //vaiśya: brahmacārī// and //gṛhastha.// And for the //śūdras:// no //brahmacārī,// only family life, and that also sometimes without marriage. This is the low grade, first grade, second grade.

So now to live as friend, as //śūdra,// that is now current all over the world. Now marriage is being forgotten. That is also written the //śāstra,// that "There will be no more marriage. One man and woman should live together by agreement." That is going on now in Kali-yuga. //Svikāram eva hy udvāhe,// it is stated. Simply agree: "Yes, you become my bedfellow; I become your bedfellow." That's all. //Svikāram eva hy udvāhe.// That is marriage. No more that ceremonial marriage. That is being forgotten. This is Kali-yuga now. //Dāmpatyam eva hi... Ratim eva hi dāmpatye:// "And their so-called unity, man and woman, means sex." There is no other meaning. //Dāmpatye,// union of man and woman, means sex. There is no other religious system, I mean, that husband, wife live together; they should cooperate for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These things are being forgotten.

So Kali-yuga, these things are very common, but in the previous //yuga,// Satya-yuga, they were not very common, but rare. This combination of the //brāhmaṇa// and the //śūdrāṇī,// this is accidental. It is not common. So anyway, accidental or organized, it doesn't matter. One who violates the rules and regulation, immediately he comes to the category of such classification. So he became a //śūdra.// Although he was born in a //brāhmaṇa// family, he was being trained up, but on account of the association of a //śūdrāṇī,// prostitute, he fell down and he became a //pāpaḥ,// most sinful man. So as a //pāpaḥ,// he did not know how to earn money honestly. He is neither //brāhmaṇa,// nor //kṣatriya,// nor //vaiśya.// He is now not even //śūdra;// less than that. Therefore it is said, //yatas tataś ca upaninye:// "somehow or other." According to classification, a //brāhmaṇa// has got specific function for earning his livelihood, a //kṣatriya// has got a specific action for livelihood, a //vaiśya// has got specific action for livelihood and a //śūdra// has got a specific action for livelihood. But he became less than //śūdra.// Therefore //yatas tataś ca//---"Somehow or other, bring money, bring money." This is called //yatas tataś ca,// no fixed up.

A //brāhmaṇa...// Everyone has to earn livelihood. That is a fact. Without working, you cannot live. So there are specific... Just like //brāhmaṇa---yajan yājan paṭhan pāṭhan dānaḥ pratigrahaḥ.// He must be very good worshiper of the Lord, and he must induce his //yajamāna,// his dependent. //Brāhmaṇa// is the head, and the //kṣatriya, vaiśya,// they are //yajamāna.// So they should induce, just like we are inducing all over the world, "Open temple. Worship Kṛṣṇa." This is //brāhmaṇa's// business.

> śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā
> śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārjanādau
> yuktasya bhaktāṁś ca niyuñjato 'pi
> vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam

This is the duty of the //guru.// He worships himself. Unless he knows how to worship, how he will teach them? So he acts himself as //brāhmaṇa,// and he teaches the disciple how to work as a //brāhmaṇa. Śrī-vigraha.// This is called //yajana yājana. Paṭhana pāṭhana:// he must be a learned //brāhmaṇa,// and he must teach others how to become learned //brāhmaṇa, paṇḍita. Paṭhana pāṭhana yajana yājana dāna pratigraha:// he can accept charity from others, and he will distribute it by temple worship, distribute. All that you have collected, worship the Deity and distribute //prasādam,// distribute this, distribute... //Dānaḥ pratigrahaḥ.// This is //brāhmaṇa's// business. //Paṭhana pāṭhana yajana yājana.// And //kṣatriya,// they will be governor of certain villages or little extended, and they will give protection. //Kṣatriya// means giving protection. If somebody is coming outside to attack you, the //kṣatriya// kings will immediately come out, and with sword they will give you protection. And because the //kṣatriya// gives you protection, therefore you give him some tax. Unless the governor or the government does not give you protection, they have no place to tax. That is not... That is illegal.

Therefore //kṣatriya// can levy tax because he gives protection. And a //brāhmaṇa,// he elevates the society to spiritual standard. Then simply protection and advancing in spiritual life will not do. We must have food also. So that is //vaiśya's// business. //Kṛṣi-gorakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:44|[Bg. 18.44]]]. The //vaiśyas// should produce food. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. Unless people eat, how they will live? Simply becoming king for levying tax and simply becoming //brāhmaṇa// to teach how to worship, but if you have no food, then what you will do? There must be arrangement for food. That is entrusted to the //vaiśyas.// In this way this is classification. Not by birth one becomes //brāhmaṇa,// and working less than a //śūdra,// and he is still //brāhmaṇa.// This is not... This is nonsense. One must be //guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. The society is divided according to the quality he is working, accordingly.

So this is the Vedic society. Now it is all lost. But if you revive it, people will be happy, if you can revive it. There is no difficulty. But unfortunately, in this age everyone has become //śūdra,// so it is little difficult to raise them again. But if everyone is engaged in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// then everything is possible. Without chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// they are all fallen. Artificially you cannot raise them to the standard of living. That is not possible. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. They must be cleansed of the dirty things within the heart, and then it will. That is the instruction we are going... This man is falling down, and how he will be elevated by chanting the holy name of Nārāyaṇa, that is the narration we are going to have. Now, how he is fallen down, that is now being described. And how he'll be raised, that will be also described.

So now it is falling down. His business... He has got family, wife, children, and he requires money, because the economic development, economic impetus, begins from this family affection. It is fact. Nobody would earn money. Therefore, if one is not married, he does not like to earn money. This is natural. And if he has got family, wife and children, then he will try to earn money. So this man is a rogue, he is sinful, but because still he has got children and wife, therefore he has to earn money. But because he is sinful, he cannot earn money honestly. //Yatas tataś ca upaninye. Yena tena prakāreṇa:// "Bring money. Somehow or other, bring money." //Yatas tataś ca upaninye nyāyataḥ anyāyataḥ. Nyāyataḥ// means legally, lawfully. //Nyāya// means law. //Anyāyataḥ,// "without legal." Just like we can earn money by stealing, but that is //anyāyataḥ.// You cannot touch others' property. //Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. This is Vedic instruction. Whatever you are allotted, you can... "A //brāhmaṇa,// you can earn like this. A //kṣatriya,// you can earn like this. A //vaiśya,// you can earn like this." But don't encroach upon others' property. But he became sinful, //yena tena prakāreṇa. Nyāyataḥ anyāyataḥ. Nyāyataḥ// is finished because he was a //brāhmaṇa.// No more he is //brāhmaṇa.// So //anyāyataḥ,// simply unlawfully. //Anyāya.// Why? //Babhāra,// maintaining; //asyāḥ kuṭumbinyāḥ,// the family members, wife and children. //Kuṭumbaṁ manda-dhīr ayam. Manda-dhīḥ. Manda// means very bad, very bad intelligence. In this way he began to earn his money and gradually he degraded, and that will be described, how he became degraded.

So beginning his degradation is the association. He was a //brāhmaṇa,// but by chance he became associated with a prostitute. So this association is very, very important. By association... //Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ// [[books:bg:2:62|[Bg. 2.62]]]. If you associate with good association, then you become good, and if you associate with bad association, then you become bad. Therefore we are establishing Kṛṣṇa conscious Society. A Kṛṣṇa conscious man cannot be bad. Therefore, if people are given chance to associate with this Society, automatically he'll become good. Otherwise there is no need of opening so many centers all over the world. But the idea is that to give the chance of good association.

Therefore, those who are members of this Society, they should be ideal. Simply by their association people will become good. Very good responsibility. And if they become bad themselves, there is no possibility, because we are giving instruction, we are behaving like that, still one becomes bad---oḥ, that is very great misfortune. Therefore all our members, the members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness Society, should be ideal. At least people may see that "Here is a class of men---ideal character, ideal behavior, spiritual advanced, and very frugal and very nice." That is... //Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]]. That is natural. If one becomes a devotee... That is the certificate, that how one has achieved good qualities. That is the test of becoming a devotee. //Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ.// A devotee means he has, what is called, awakened all the good qualities.

The good qualities are there. Because we are part and parcel of God, there is no bad quality in our constitutional position. We are godly. We may be small, but the same quality. So there cannot be originally. //Asaṅgo 'yaṁ puruṣaḥ.// This is Vedic instruction. A living entity means spiritually part and parcel of God. There cannot be any bad quality. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. Arjuna said to Kṛṣṇa that //pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān:// "You are the most pure." So how His part and parcel can be impure? Gold may be a small particle gold, but it is gold. It cannot be otherwise. Similarly, we, being //mamaivāṁśaḥ...// Kṛṣṇa says that "They are My living beings. They are My part and parcel." So there cannot be any bad thing. The bad thing is because we have accepted this material body.

So in order to come back to our original position---completely good; no bad thing---we must come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise we are gone; we are condemned. This is the purpose of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement: to bring him again to the platform of complete goodness.

Thank you very much.
