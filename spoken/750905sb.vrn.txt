**Nitāi:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

So two parties, Yamadūta and the Bhagavad-dūtā. So this human life is the junction, which way to go: to the Yamadūtas or to the Bhagavad-dūtās. There is no three. Two alternative. In the Bible also it is said, "Either you go to hell or go to heaven." Is it not? This is right. Yamadūta means go to hell, and Bhagavad-dūtā means go to Vaikuṇṭha. This is the junction.

Now make your selection. So long we are in the lower, animal life, nature is giving chance. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. Then nature brings you in the platform of human life, developed consciousness, and you can take advantage of the //śāstra. Anādi bahirmukha kṛṣṇa bhuli gela, ataeva kṛṣṇa veda purāṇa karilā// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]]. //Veda-Purāṇa,// why they have been made? It is made for the human being. This is the chance. //Veda-Purāṇa// is not made for the cats and dogs. They are not supposed to read //Veda// and //Purāṇas.// Similarly, if the human being does not take care of the //Veda-Purāṇa,// then he is no better than the cats and dogs. //Ataeva kṛṣṇa veda purāṇa karilā:// to revive our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Uttiṣṭhata jāgrata prāpta-varān nibodhata.// This is the Vedic injunction.

So long you were in the lower grade of life it was not possible for you to take the path of //Vedas// and //Purāṇas.// That was not possible. But now, even if getting the human form of life, if you sleep for sense gratification like cats and dogs, then the Yamadūta... Yamadūta. //Kṛṣṇa nāma kara bhāi āra saba miche, palaye barā kathā naya yo māche piche.//[?] These are very easily understandable. You cannot avoid Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is not possible. If you avoid, then //yo māche piche//---the Yamadūta will carry you. You can say, "I can do whatever I like. Why you are forcing me to become Kṛṣṇa conscious? I can do whatever I like. There is no need of your preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I am independent. I don't believe in the next life." That is the general statement of the rascals and fools. But the fact is different. If you don't take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then Yamadūtas. Then you'll be punished. You cannot avoid. You are completely dependent on Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme, and you are the servant. You have declined to serve Kṛṣṇa; therefore you must be punished. This is the nature's way. //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. You cannot escape. You cannot escape the mundane, man-made laws, but you cannot the God-made laws. That is not possible.

So Yamadūtas, they came to take him. Now the Viṣṇudūta... //Evaṁ te bhagavad-dūtā.// So Bhagavad-dūtā... Bhagavān is not alone, without any followers. In the Vaikuṇṭhaloka Bhagavān is there in His innumerable forms. There are innumerable Vaikuṇṭhalokas, and in each and every planet there is innumerable devotees. He is not alone. //Advaitam acyutam anantam ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca// [Bs. 5.33]. So Yamadūtas... As the Yamarāja has got his adherent order carriers, similarly, in the Vaikuṇṭhaloka there are so many order carriers. In the Vaikuṇṭhaloka there is not a single person who is not a devotee. That is Vaikuṇṭha. Vaikuṇṭha means... //Kuṇṭha// means anxiety, and //vigata-kuṇṭha iti vaikuṇṭha.// There is no anxiety. And the material world means anxiety: "What will happen? What will happen?" Even the sparrow, you will see, you give them some grain, they are eating, but they are looking this way, that way: "If somebody is not coming to kill me?" Everyone---full of anxiety. That we are forgetting, that we are trying to remain in this material world very happy, but that is not possible. Anxiety, full of anxiety.

Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja said, //hitvātma-ghātaṁ gṛhaṁ andha-kūpaṁ vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśyrayeta.// He was asked by his father what was the best thing he had learned. So he said, "I have learned this best thing." What is that? //Hitvātma-ghātaṁ gṛham andha-kūpaṁ vanaṁ gato yad dharim āśrayeta// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]. "This is the first-class thing." What is that? "Now, giving up this //gṛha andha-kūpaṁ, gṛhastha// life." They are thinking very happy, husband, wife, living together, enjoying. But that is //grha andha-kūpam. Andha-kūpam// means if you are thrown into the dark well, it is like that. Of course, those who are Kṛṣṇa conscious, that is different thing. But ordinarily, the so-called household life means to be in the darkness, in the dark well. //Gṛhānda-kū..., hitva:// "One should give up." Therefore, according to Vedic civilization, when one is fifty years old, above that, he must give up family life. No more. Then //sannyāsa.// Not that up to the point of death one should remain a //gṛhastha.// No. If he wants to become free from anxiety, that is... Otherwise, anxiety. //Tat sādhu manye asura-varya dehināṁ sadā samudvigna-dhiyām// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]. //Dehinām,// one who has accepted this material body, he must be always restless with anxiety. This is the... //Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. You cannot avoid it.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, you can take it as a religious movement, //bhāgavata-dharma.// This is the only //dharma, bhāgavata-dharma.// Except //bhāgavata-dharma,// any other //dharma,// so-called //dharma,// is cheating. That is not //dharma. Dharmāṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat pranītaṁ// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. //Bhagavat-pranītam,// therefore called //Bhāgavatam.// The word //Bhāgavatam// comes from the word //bhagavat. Bhavārthe sipan[?//]. //Bhagavad-bhāva iti bhāgavata.// So religion means what is given by God. //Dharmāṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-pranītam.// You cannot manufacture religion, nonsense, give this //dharma,// that //dharma,// that //dharma.// No. //Dharma// is only one. That is //bhāgavata-dharma.// Otherwise there is no //dharma.// They are all cheating. //Ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. The fight between different religious principles, religious followers---"I am Hindu," "You are Muslim," "I am Christian," "I am Buddha," "My religion is better," "Your religion is bad"---these are all not religion. Real religion is //bhāgavata-dharma.// In any other religion there is //para-hiṁsa. Para-hiṁsa.// In the history you will find many instances. In our country I have seen fight between Hindus and Muslims, and in the history you will find Europe, the Protestants and the Roman Catholics, and the Crusade.

So this kind of religion has no value. Religion means when one understands Kṛṣṇa, or God, he understands automatically that all living entities are Kṛṣṇa's part and parcel. Some way or other, they have been put into this //māyā. Anādi bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]]. They have forgotten. Therefore a devotee tries to bring them back to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, back to home, back to Godhead. This is vision. He has no discrimination that "Here is a Hindu," "Here is a Muslim," "Here is a Christian," "Here is an African," "Here is a white," "Here is a black." No. "Everyone is Kṛṣṇa's part and parcel. Let them revive their Kṛṣṇa consciousness and be happy." That is religion. All others cheating.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we are pushing on. We have no such distinction. //Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.// Not that "They are Europeans. They cannot take to this religion." This is in the //andha-kūpa, andha. Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantrya uru-dāmni baddhāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. Such class of men are subjected to the punishment by the Yamadūta. Otherwise, //paṇḍitaḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. //Paṇḍita,// they should be equal. Kṛṣṇa says,

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striya śūdrās tatra vaiśyās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]

Everyone has got the right to go back to home, back to Godhead. Kṛṣṇa says, //ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ:// "Never mind he is born in the sinful family. That's all right. But he has got the right to go back to home, back to Godhead." And who will take up the work? If everyone has got the right to go back to home, back to Godhead, and by taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya...// Kṛṣṇa says, "Everyone has got the right." Then who will teach them how to go back to home, back to Godhead? Who is the man? If you say, "No, no, they are untouchable, //pāpa-yoni.// They are untouchable. They cannot," so that is not the duty.

The duty is, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila jāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

Anyone who has taken birth in India, if he's a man... If he's a dog, if he's a cat, that is another. If he's a man... //Manuṣya janma haila jāra.// So what is his duty? //Janma sārthaka kari.// First of all awaken your own Kṛṣṇa consciousness---you understand Kṛṣṇa---and then go out, //kara para upakāra.// Because people are in darkness. People are in darkness. They have forgotten Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness meant, not that "I have understood Kṛṣṇa. Now pack it up in the box and see sometimes: 'Oh, I have become Kṛṣṇa conscious.' " My Guru Mahārāja condemned this. He said, //mana tumi kisera vaiṣṇava:// "My dear mind, you are thinking that you have become a very good Vaiṣṇava and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and smoking //bīḍī.//" This imitation has no value. My Guru Mahārāja condemned it. He said, //mana tumi kisera vaiṣṇava:// "What a rascal you are. You are thinking that you are Vaiṣṇava." //Nirjanera ghare...// What is that? I forget now. //Tava hari-nāma kevala kaitava. Pratiṣṭhāra tare, nirjanera ghare, tava hari-nāma kevala kaitava:// "My dear mind, you are very much proud of becoming Vaiṣṇava. In a solitary place you are imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura." //Nirjanera ghare, pratiṣṭhāra tare:// "Your this solitary chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa means that you want cheap popularity---'Oh, he is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.' " That is not possible. You cannot imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura.

So by imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura, keeping connection with woman and doing all nonsense... You cannot imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura. You must work. You must go out for chanting, for preaching. This is the real chanting. //Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa' upadeśa.// This is wanted, Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has never said that "You may imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura, and in a solitary place, 'Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... //Bīḍī bīḍī, bīḍī.//' " Not like that. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Go out."

> yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> āmāra ājñāya guru haya tāra' ei deśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

So our request is, you all foreigners, so you have learned something about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order. Although He expected that every Indian should go out for //parupakāra,// but anyway, some of the Indians, at least one... But you take this mission and go everywhere, in every corner. I am thankful to you. You are already doing that, in Europe and America, [people are] deep asleep. Because people are sleeping under misguidance, and they are becoming candidate for being carried away by the Yamadūta. This is the position of the whole world, Yamadūta. //Palaye barā kathā naya yo māche piche.// Yamāduta will not excuse you, however you may be very proud of becoming independent. This is not possible. To save the human civilization, the rascal civilization, that "There is no life after death, and you go on enjoying as much as you like," this wrong civilization is killing civilization. So you save them. You save them. Otherwise, the Yamadūta is there.

//Evaṁ te bhagavad-dūtā yamadūtābhibhāṣitam, upadhārya.// They listened to the words of Yamadūta very carefully, //upadhārya,// not that haphazardously they heard. No. Their reason, their everything, that "This man was like this, and he must be carried to Yamarāja for punishment..." Why punishment? No, to make him purified, it is said. Punishment required. This is nature's law. Just like if you have infected some disease, the punishment is you must suffer for it. The punishment is good. If you have infected some disease, and when you suffer, that means you become purified from the disease. Suffering is not bad; to become purified. Therefore when a devotee suffers, he does not take it ill-ly. He thinks that "I am being purified. I am being purified."

> tat te 'nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇo
> bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam
> hṛd-vāg-vapurbhir vidadhan namas te
> jīveta yo mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk
> [SB 10.14.8]

A devotee, when he is in troubled condition, he thinks, "My Lord is so kind that He is purifying me. I am suffering from my past misdeeds. So Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He is purifying me, giving me little suffering. That's all right. Therefore I must be obliged to Him." And he offers more respectful obeisances to the Lord: "My Lord, You are purifying me." If one lives like this, //mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk,// his liberation is guaranteed.

//Dāya-bhāk. Dāya-bhāk// means just like the son inherits the father's property without any check. Nobody can check. Law is there---"The father's property must be inherited by the son." Similarly, those who are strictly, I mean to say, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, despite all kinds of hindrances, his liberation is guaranteed. His liberation is guaranteed. And if he becomes little..., immediately disturbed with little inconvenience, and "What is this nonsense, Kṛṣṇa con...? Give it up. Let me enjoy," then he is again in the clutches of //māyā.// But if one sticks to Kṛṣṇa consciousness in spite of all difficulties, then his liberation, going back to home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. //Mukti-pade sa dāya-bhāk// [SB 10.14.8]. This is the statement of the //śāstra. Dāya-bhāk// means nobody can check it.

So we should be very careful to stick to Kṛṣṇa consciousness without being agitated or deviated in any circumstances of life. Then we will not be liable to the punishment of Yamadāta. That is the incident happening here. Slightly he became Kṛṣṇa conscious at the end of life and chanted "Nārāyaṇa"---immediately the Viṣṇu, Bhagavad-dūta came: "Oh, he has chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// That's all right. Let him take back home, back to Godhead."

Thank you very much.
