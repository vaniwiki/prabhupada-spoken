Very important verse. Ideal class of men therefore needed in the society. Therefore Vedic society is divided, ideal men: the //brāhmaṇas. Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.// The //brāhmaṇa,// the saintly person, the //sannyāsī,// the //rājarṣi,// this is required. //Imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said that the //Bhagavad-gītā// was taught to the //rājarṣi,// not to the third-class men. //Rājarṣi: rāja// and //ṛṣi// at the same time. Although king, but they were saintly king, just like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, the ideal king. Bhagavān, Rāmacandra, the ideal king. Ideal king, so ideal that because some citizen criticized that "Lord Rāmacandara, King Rāmacandra, has accepted His wife who was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa," and he was a low-class man, washerman, and still, the King, Lord Rāmacandra, thought that "My citizens are criticizing Me." Immediately He separated, Lakṣmī-devi, Sītā. This is ideal king, no criticism from the citizen, even Lord Rāmacandra. This is called //rājarṣi.//

Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Mahārāja Parīkṣit... Parīkṣit Mahārāja was going on his tour. These Pāṇḍavas, they were the emperor of the whole world. So he saw that a black man was trying to kill a cow. So immediately he took action: "Who is this man trying to kill cow?" So he chastised him, punished him. He was going to kill him, but he saved himself, that "This is my time. I am Kali-yuga. I am the representative. So this is my business, to kill cow. So what can I do?" Then he said that "You better get out. Otherwise I shall kill you." "So where shall I go?" "Now, out of my kingdom." "Then where is not your kingdom? The whole world is your kingdom. Where shall I go? I am also your subject. You must give me a place." Then he gave him the places---//striyaḥ sūnā pānaṁ dyūtaṁ yatra pāpas catur-vidhaḥ:// "You can remain in four places: where illicit sex is indulged, prostitution, you can remain there; and //sūnā,//" means unnecessary killing animals, slaughterhouse, "you can remain there. And brothel and liquor house," //striyaḥ sūnā pāna,// "where intoxication is indulged, you can remain there. And gambling," //pāna dyūta// [[books:sb:1:17:38|[SB 1.17.38]]]. //Dyūta// means gambling. "You can remain in these places."

So it was very difficult for Kali to find out such place, because Mahārāja Parīkṣit's time the kingdom was so nice that there was no brothel, no slaughterhouse, no liquor shop and no gambling club. This is //rājarṣi.// So you could not find. Therefore Kali made a conspiracy how to get out Mahārāja Parīkṣit so that he could spread his influence. So long Mahārāja Parīkṣit was there, there was no influence of Kali-yuga. So after all, the age has come. It is ordained. So Parīkṣit Mahārāja was cursed by a //brāhmaṇa// to die within seven days, and after his death the Kali-yuga spreaded its influence. And now, by the advancement of ages, you will find these four places in every home. This is... Illicit sex and intoxication, gambling and meat-eating---this is Kali-yuga.

So the king was very strict not to allow these things. The people were following. //Yad yad ācarati śreyān.// The king was strict; the government was strict. Therefore people were following. So these sinful activities of the whole world can be stopped immediately if the government is strong. But the government members, they are themself, they are victims of Kali-yuga, so how they can stop it? Some big, big politician, when they enjoy, they bring naked girls and drinking, and this is their standard of enjoyment. So how you can expect good government? It is not possible. Why they should be bothering about people's happiness? They want to occupy big, big ministerial post to enjoy their life. Therefore the position of the whole world is so deteriorated because there is no ideal man. All rogues, thieves, I mean to say, very fallen condition. Therefore people are deteriorating.

//Dāmpatye ratim eva hi.// These will be the signs of Kali-yuga. //Dāmpata// means husband and wife. Their relation will stand so long they satisfy one another by sex, //rati. Rati// means sex. //Dāmpate ratim eva hi.// And as soon as there is sex disturbance, divorce: "I don't want you." //Vipratve sūtram eva hi:// "A //brāhmaṇa// means one two-//paisa// thread." That's all. "A //sannyāsī// means a rod." These are the explanations. And a very expert man means //kuṭumba, dākṣyaṁ kuṭumba-bharaṇam.// If anyone can maintain a family---family means one wife and one or two children---then he is to be considered very expert, successful, because... Therefore you will find in these days no wife, no children, no family. In Western countries they take dog as the best friend, and television. That's all. Because this is Kali-yuga, no family. But he must have some companion, but he doesn't want family, the botheration of family. Then dog is the best friend. What can be done? This is going on, and it will increase more and more, more and more.

Therefore, at the present moment it is a great necessity to have some ideal men. //Yad yad ācarati śreyān.// Therefore we are endeavoring to create some ideal men, Kṛṣṇa conscious men, their character, their behavior, their ideal aim of life. So those who have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness seriously, they should be ideal men. The society will be benefited at least by seeing their behavior. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taught us, //āpani ācari prabhu jīveri śikṣāya:// if you don't behave yourself as an ideal man, you cannot preach. Your preaching will not be successful. //Āpani ācari prabhu jīveri śikṣāya.// Because the nature's law is that ordinary men, they follow the ideal. If there is //rājarṣi, kṣatriya,// ruler, king, just like saintly person, like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Parīkṣit, Lord Rāmacandra---there are many---Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, then people will be happy. Just like it is described, during the reign of Mahārāja Parīkṣit there was no trouble at all of the citizens. They were free from even ordinary minor diseases. It is said there, in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// And so far production is concerned, it is said that the land was producing all the necessities. //Sarva-dughāṁ mahī. Sarva-kāma-dughāṁ mahī.// Actually we get everything from the earth, all supplies. We are getting these flowers from earth. We are getting these fruits from earth. We are getting foodstuff from the earth. We are getting minerals from the earth---everything. //Sarva-dughāṁ mahī.// So nature will supply you sufficiently, provided you follow ideal life. Otherwise nature will punish you. There will be no supply.

These are all described in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The nature was not supplying sufficiently, and then Mahārāja Pṛthu, the personified Pṛthvī, he was going to kill her, punish her. King's business is, if somebody is doing wrong, then the king must punish. So he was prepared to punish Pṛthvī. She submitted that "King, why you are trying to punish me? It is my business when people become demons, I restrict my supply." So this is nature's law. As soon as you become demons, godless, nature will restrict supply. There will be no rain, no production. There will be scarcity, everything. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. Everything is being carried by //prakṛti.// And //prakṛti// is working under the direction of Kṛṣṇa. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. Without //prakṛti's// cooperation you cannot get anything. You may have big, big mills and factories---useless. You cannot manufacture, I mean to say, rice, grains. Even if you eat meat, the cows and the animals, they must eat vegetables. There will be no vegetables. How you will be able to eat meat even? So nature has got the restricting power. As you become more and more demons and sinful, nature will restrict supply and you'll suffer. This is the law.

> mama māyā duratyayā
> mām eva ye prapadyante
> māyām etāṁ taranti
> [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]

Therefore our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is just to teach people how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, surrender unto Him. Then they will be happy. This is the way of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We want to create some ideal men. People will see them, and at least they will understand that "Here are the ideal men." They will be ashamed. So those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, they should be //śreyān//---//yad yad ācarati śreyān//---the best men in the society. Otherwise useless. If you waste your time to make a free hotel and sleep---useless. That will not make our mission successful, if you take advantage of free hotel and no work. That will not be successful. We must be //śreyān,// first-class men. That is wanted, because there is no first-class men. All fourth class, fifth class, //śūdra. Kalau śūdrā-sambhavāḥ. Śūdra// means fourth-class men, and //caṇḍāla// means fifth-class men.

So nowadays they are mainly //caṇḍālas. Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. //Yavana// and //caṇḍālas.// By the grace of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, this movement is able to pick up even //caṇḍālas// and //yavanās// to become //brāhmaṇas.//

> māṁ ca 'vyabhicāriṇī
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

"One who is engaged in devotional service, he becomes immediately transcendental to these," I mean to say, "infection of the three qualities of material nature." //Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.// That is actually happening. This powerful Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so strong that we can pick up from the lowest stage of life and bring him to the highest stage of life if we follow the rules and regulation. It is possible. And practically we are seeing. So that is required, //yad yad ācarati śreyān,// a class of men. Maybe minority; it doesn't matter. But their ideal behavior, character, will lead other people to appreciate: "Yes. We should be like this." Now, who was telling this night? I think Praṇava was telling that some friend has told that in the Western countries they are appreciating this movement because I have stopped amongst my members this intoxication. There are. Are you not telling?

**Praṇava:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They are gradually appreciating that "Oh." Yes, Professor Judah also, he says that. They are appreciating now, that "How is this, nice movement, that our students, they were habituated to all these, and they have now become God conscious? They are mad after God." And one priest in Boston, he also agreed. One priest came to see me. He said, "Swāmījī, how is that? Your disciples look so bright." They are appreciating. This is wanted: everyone //śreyān.// So this movement is very important movement because it is creating first-class men so that others will see and follow. So this is required. //Yad yad ācarati śreyān tad tad itaraḥ īhate.// It is natural. A father may be drunkard, but he doesn't like to see his son has become drunkard. This is natural. Everyone appreciates good quality. So similarly, if we can create an ideal class of men, then others, who are fallen, he will try to become like us. So don't take this movement very insignificantly. Very serious. And those who are members, they should become ideal. We have got very easy method to become ideal. Avoid these four principles of sinful life and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa sixteen times---you become ideal.

> paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam
> [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]

So in the very beginning, the first thing is //ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.// We are all suffering on account of ignorance. There are so many nasty, dirty things within our heart. It will be cleansed. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.//

> tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ

> bhagavaty uttama-śloke
> bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī
> [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]

These are the formulas. If we hear //Bhāgavatam// from //Bhāgavatam,// not from the professional men who have made business for reciting //Bhāgavata...// No. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.// There are two //bhāgavatas: grantha-bhāgavata// and the man //bhāgavata.// So therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu's secretary, Svarūpa Dāmodara, he recommended a //brāhmaṇa...// He came to see him, writing something that was full of mistakes. Then he chastised him, that "You do not know what is what. You have tried to explain //Bhāgavatam.//" But when the //brāhmaṇa// was submissively hearing and tolerated the chastisement, then he gave the advice, //bhāgavata porā giyā bhāgavata-sthāne:// "Go. Hear //Bhāgavata// from a person whose life is //Bhāgavata.//" //Bhāgavata parā giyā bhāgavata-sthāne.// Not the professional //bhāgavata.// They are aiming... Therefore they immediately open the //rāsa-līlā// chapter and explain it very nicely. People will like: "Oh, Kṛṣṇa and myself, the same. He is also embracing young girl. I shall now try to find out young girl." This is going on. They are going to hell by hearing //Bhāgavatam// from these rascal professionals.

//Bhāgavata// is meant from the very beginning... First of all try to understand what is God. //Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itaraḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Nine cantos to explain what is God. Then Tenth Chapter..., Canto, God, Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is there. Not Tenth Canto immediately. So everything is misused, only for "Money, money, money. Bring money." This is Kali-yuga. Everything will be judged by money. And as soon as there is money there will be //hiṁsa.// Therefore this //bhāgavata-dharma// is not for this class of men. //Dharma-projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇām// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. Those who are above enviousness, those who are above after hankering after money, for them. This //bhāgavata-dharma// is not for them. //Paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ. Paramhaṁsāya.//

So we have taken this //Bhāgavatam.// We should be very, very careful to become first-class men so that others will follow. //Sa yat pramāṇaṁ kurute// [[books:bg:3:21|[Bg. 3.21]]]. If you become a first-class man, //sa yat pramāṇam,// whatever you will do, //lokas tad anuvartate,// people will follow, naturally. //Lokas tad anuvartate.// Unfortunately, nowadays first-class man means kill Kṛṣṇa. This is first-class man. All these so-called rascal scholars of //Bhagavad-gītā,// their only business is how to kill Kṛṣṇa---Kaṁsa, as Kaṁsa was planning how to kill Kṛṣṇa. That was his plan, demon. He was also thinking of Kṛṣṇa, but he was thinking Kṛṣṇa, how to kill Him. So that is not //bhakti.// Kṛṣṇa consciousness... He was also Kṛṣṇa conscious. He was thinking always, twenty-four hours, Kṛṣṇa, "How to kill Kṛṣṇa." So that is not //bhakti. Bhakti// means how to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is //bhakti. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ, na tu pratikūlyena// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. //Pratikūla// means adverse. Yes. If you think of Kṛṣṇa adversely, how to kill this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement... Of course, Kṛṣṇa is so nice that even if you think of Kṛṣṇa adversely, because you'll chant "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa," you will get benefit. Kṛṣṇa is so nice. Because you are chanting unconsciously... Just like there were so many propaganda in Germany: "The Hare Kṛṣṇa people are so bad." But every paper chanted Hare Kṛṣṇa. "Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is bad," but in the beginning, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." So therefore, in spite of their propaganda, we are existing there. We are existing. We have come out triumphant. They could not do anything.

So the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is so strong, and indirectly, directly, or some way or other if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, you become benefited. It is so. So if you neglectfully chant Hare Kṛṣṇa you become so benefited, then how much you will be benefited if you carefully chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That should be the ideal. Therefore, //sa yat pramāṇaṁ kurute lokas tad anuvartate.// Unfortunately, those decrying this Kṛṣṇa movement or Kṛṣṇa... They directly making propaganda. When Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], the so-called scholars, they say, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa." They're misleading. //Lokas tad anuvartate.// The people are becoming against Kṛṣṇa: "Why Kṛṣṇa should be God? I have got another God, manufactured. Here is God." Kṛṣṇa was so beautiful, and I am God, so ugly God? No. There are so many ugly Gods nowadays, that ferocious face and he is God. We worship God, so nice face, people come and become enchanted. And they bring a God, a ferocious head, and he becomes God. This is going on. The whole propaganda is like that. Even big, big political leaders, they'll say, "We don't believe in Kṛṣṇa, there was a person as Kṛṣṇa living ever."

So people are being misled. //Lokas tad anuvartate.// He has taken the position of //śreyān,// big leader, big scholar, and he is decrying Kṛṣṇa. So what people will do? They are helpless. They will give, "Oh, Mr. Such-and-such said it is fiction. Kṛṣṇa is imagination." This is going on. In Vṛndāvana you'll find so many big, big Māyāvādīs, they're explaining that this Kṛṣṇa concept is an imagination, and people are thronged together to hear him, in Vṛndāvana, and what to speak of other places.

So this is the position of the world, and they are suffering and they will continue to suffer. Nature will punish them. Yamarāja will take them. That is their next life. So you try to save them. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
