====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] Do you know this? [break] ...go somewhere, better go, at least four men. And when you read some knowledge, at least two men. But when you eat, one man. Don't bring four men and two men. Then he will be hungry; you will be hungry. [laughter] So for advancement of knowledge, two men at least required, discussion---not that I am reading and sleeping also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Just before coming here we were in Laguṇa Beach, and Gurukṛpā Mahārāja, Yaśodānandana Mahārāja, Paramahaṁsa Mahārāja, Viṣṇujana Mahārāja and myself, we got your new books, //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// So we were reading constantly from early in the morning. We found it was very enlivening, the fact that we were reading amongst a number of devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Therefore it is called //iṣṭagoṣṭhī,// or discussion. Discussion does not take place alone. There must be at least two.

**Indian man (1):**
//Dvabhyaṁ pathanaṁ pathī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Dvabhyaṁ patanam.// [Hindi] ...instruction... [Hindi] Either you speak in Bengali or in Sanskrit. [break] Then that is an asset. One day they will come to help us. It is called //ajñāta-sukṛtī,// devotional advancement without knowledge. Even Māyāvādīs have actually appreciated. In Hyderabad, these Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs// were challenged by the people that "Bhaktivedanta Swami has gone to foreign countries, and he established so many Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple. What did you do? If you say that you disagree with Bhaktivedanta Swami---you worship demigods---so how many demigods' temple you have established?" They challenge like that. "If you say that you are worshiper of Lord Śiva, why don't you go and establish a Śiva temple? You are sitting idly here."

**Indian man (2):**
And Śiva always worshiped Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another thing. That is another thing. They, "If you believe that Lord Śiva is the Supreme, why don't you go and establish? Why you are sitting here and declaring //jagad-guru?//" Their purpose was that "Either you worship Śiva or Kṛṣṇa, it doesn't matter, but if you would have done something, that would have spread the Hindu conception of... But you are not doing there anything. Why do you call yourself //jagad-guru?//" [Hindi] "A jackal is the king in the forest." And they do not go outside.

**Indian man (2):**
They do not go outside because even the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Even Gaṅgeśvarānanda went; he came back, disappointed. What they will do? Chinmayananda goes so many times. What does he do? [Hindi] [break] He is so big, what does he have? What he has done? This thing going on. //Phalena paricīyate.// One has to be studied by the result, not by talking. It is not that Caitanya Mahāprabhu entrusted the subject of preaching only unto me. Why they do not go, the //gosvāmīs, svāmīs,// big, big //sannyāsīs,// and stalwart? Why they are rotting within this area?

**Indian man (2):**
They know only how to criticize for nothing.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, what is the meaning of that criticize? First of all you come to the stage.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Enviousness.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now Bon Mahārāja, our Godbrother, went. What did he bring? He brought some HMD. HMD. You know HMD? You do not know?

**Indian man (3):**
Hindustan Machine Tools.

**Indian man (2):**
//Ācchā.// When Bon Mahārāja came I asked him many things, many questions. He was praising, and he said that more than fifty percent people are liking our organization in USA. Only due to that, their children got saved from intoxication. And they are happy that their lives are also... That's what he told me. I told him, "What is your impression about our organization there, and how have you heard?" Then he told me everything. He also told me that one or two places [indistinct] he just... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...official said, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." When we went to...

**Prabhupāda:**
They have been forced to forget Hare Kṛṣṇa by the so-called rascal leaders. Otherwise India is meant for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, the whole India. [break] ...scandalous these Māyāvādīs, and next the politician, killing the spirit of India. These Māyāvādīs teaching, "Why you are after God? You are God." That's all. And he says, "Yes, I am God. Why shall I worship God?" This is the... And becoming God..., when they do not get any relish of becoming God, then the politician says, "It is all useless. Come to the political field. Take //daridra-nārāyaṇa-seva.// That's all, finished." The Māyāvādī creates the field of atheism, and later on, the politician make them perfect atheist.

**Indian man (2):**
I am also building a small temple in my place here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...kuṭumba-bharaṇena vā. Nidrāya hṛiyate naktaṁ vyāvayena ca vā vayaḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:3|[SB 2.1.3]]]. //Vayaḥ// means age. They are wasting their this human form of life, duration of life, at night either by sleeping or by sex. //Nidrāya hṛiyate naktraṁ vyāvayena ca vā vayaḥ.// And in daytime... //Divā cārthehaya rājan...// In daytime---"Where is money? Where is money? Where is money?" [aside:] //Jaya.// And when he gets money, how to spend it for //kuṭumbha,// not for Kṛṣṇa. They get money sufficiently, and as soon as he is asked to spare some money for Kṛṣṇa, "No, the law is that I should give money to my sons. The law is." Even our devotees are saying like that. "The law is that I must give to my son, not to Kṛṣṇa."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Our devotees are saying that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [Hindi] "You just see my face, beautiful face. And whatever I had, that I have left with my sons and wife." Mostly they come...

**Indian man (2):**
And at the same time, they all are earning.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is for their sons.

**Indian man (2):**
They are earning themselves, their son, sufficiently.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] ...in the //Back to Godhead// that those who are come to Vṛndāvana for sense gratification, their next birth is monkey and dog in Vṛndāvana; then next birth liberated. So they became angry. Vṛndāvana is not for sense gratification. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore says,

> rūpa raghunātha pade haibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhabo se yugala pīriti

The //rasa-līlā// of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, a person like Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, "I could not understand it because I have not yet studied the instruction of Rūpa Gosvāmī and Raghunātha Gosvāmī, six Gosvāmīs. How can I understand?" So these people, they think by seeing //rasa-līlā// by professional men they will understand the //līlā// of Kṛṣṇa. Rūpa-Raghunātha instruction not cared for. But without going through the literature, //Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,// nobody can understand what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

> rūpa raghunātha pade haibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhabo se yugala pīriti

[Hindi] ...Goddess Kālī.

**Indian man (2):**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda? You mention in your book that recently they have begun some demigod worship in Vṛndāvana.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Not recently. Since very long time. These //gosvāmīs.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Caste //gosvāmīs.// But originally this was not the fact.

**Prabhupāda:**
Originally there was Rūpa Gosvāmī. Now they are imitation. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [end]
