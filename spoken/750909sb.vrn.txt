Just like a child is sleeping on the lap of his mother, feeling secure, completely secure, that "I am on the lap of my mother..." Naturally a child, when it is on the lap of its mother, he is quite comfortable, silent, feeling very secure. So in that position if the mother kills the child... It is like that, that //prajā// and the king... The //prajās... Prajā// means the citizens, subjects. They should be feeling so much secure, that "We are under good government. There is no disturbance." Just like during the government of Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, they were so secure that even they had no very much anxieties. "Our king is there." The world is full of anxieties, miseries and difficulties. So the good government means when the subjects, citizens, feel secure from all such things.

So here, //yasyāṅke śira ādhāya.// Suppose I am sleeping very comfortably, feeling secure by keeping my head on your lap, //yasyāṅke śira ādhāya lokaḥ svapiti,// and dreaming very happily. //Svaya dharmam adharmaṁ vā na he veda yathā paśuḥ.// You cannot expect all men to understand what is religion and what is not religion, general mass of people. So what is the position of a person or any being who does not know to make distinction what is //dharma// and //adharma?// So they have been described. He is described as //yathā paśuḥ. Paśuḥ. Paśuḥ// means animal. An animal cannot make distinction what is right or what is wrong. That is not possible. Therefore it is said, //dharmeṇa hīnā paśubhiḥ samānāḥ:// "One who is ignorant of //dharma-adharma,// he is no better than //paśu.//" //Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca sāmānyam etat paśubhiḥ narāṇām// [//Hitopadeśa// 25]. //Āhāra,// eating. I eat, the dog eats, the cat eats. I sleep, the dog sleeps and the cat sleeps. I have sex desire, I satisfy it; the cats and dogs also satisfy it. And I am also afraid of my enemy; the cats and dogs are also afraid of enemy. Then where is the difference between cats and dogs? The difference is that I can be trained up to become religious; the cats and dogs cannot be trained. That is the difference. //Dharmeṇa hīnā paśubhiḥ samānāḥ.// So if I don't take education and enlightenment how to become religious, I do not know how to distinguish between right and wrong, then //yathā paśu//---then I am as good as animal.

That is the position at the present moment, that people are not educated to distinguish or to become pious. They are not educated. They are being... Now, at the present moment, education means you learn technology and learn how to earn money, and then, after earning money, you spend it for sense gratification: eating meat, eating wine, going to the brothel, prostitutes. This is modern civilization. So therefore it is the civilization of //paśu,// animal civilization, polished animals. It is not civilization. It is the duty of the guardian, father, //guru,// government or elderly relative---everyone should be compassionate with the dependent. The father should be compassionate to the children, that "My children, they have come to me. They are now innocent. If I do not train them nicely..." What kind of training? //Na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.// That is the duty of the father, of the //guru,// how to save the dependent from the clutches of death. This is the duty. The government also. Because death is sure. As soon as we get this material body, the death is sure.

So we are eternal spiritual spark. Kṛṣṇa says that the living entity is eternal: //nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. This is the information we get from the authority, that "The living entity is eternal," //nitya, śāśvata,// "and ever-existing, and does not die on the death or annihilation of the body." Then what is the duty of the father? What is the duty of the government, duty of the //guru?// Now, how to save him from this repetition of birth and death. And that is the duty. Otherwise to give some food... That also, people cannot give now. Rather, killing their children in the womb. This is Kali-yuga. Whereas it is the duty of the parents how to save the child or the son from the clutches of death, they are now killing. This is advanced civilization. This is going on all over the world. They are going to the medical man and taking help and killing the child within the womb. This is Kali-yuga.

So here it is, the same thing said, that //yasyāṅke śira ādhāya lokaḥ svapiti nirvṛtaḥ.// The child is sleeping in the womb of the mother, and the mother is killing. Then where to take shelter? Similarly, this example is that "This Ajāmila, he might have committed some sins without knowledge. Now he is no more sinful because he has chanted the holy name of Nārāyaṇa, and he is not to be punished." That is the purpose of the Viṣṇudūta. "So why you are dragging him, trying to take him to Yamarāja to punish him? You do not know that he is innocent. We have to..." The real purpose is that everyone, we commit sinful activities on account of ignorance. Therefore the best humanitarian work is to give knowledge to the humanity, not that one is suffering for want of food and... If I give some food, that is good work, but that is not sufficient. I may give food; that's all right. You give. We also give //prasādam// free. But that does not mean simply by giving //prasādam// we are silent. We give knowledge also. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Food, automatically you have to give. That is... There is no prohibition. But at the same time: knowledge. Without knowledge-giving, if he remains ignorant... Just like the same example: if you have got some children, if you don't give them education, simply feed them, that is not your proper duty. You must give knowledge.

Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore giving them knowledge. The first knowledge is that we are trying to convince everyone, following the footprints of Lord Kṛṣṇa, as He wanted to convince in the very beginning, that //dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. This is the first knowledge. One should know that he is not this body. He is spirit soul, different from this body. He is living within this body. This is called knowledge. And at the same time, he should be supplied the necessities of the body. //Yāvād artha-prayojanaṁ. Nirbandhe kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yukta-vairāgyam ucyate. Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ// [Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu 1.2.255]. //Viṣayā. Viṣayā// means we need something for our sense gratification. That is allowed. We don't say that "You don't eat." No, you eat, but you eat //kṛṣṇa-prasādam.// Don't eat anything else. Then gradually your senses will be conquered. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [Brs. 1.2.234].

If you want to realize God, first of all you should engage your tongue in the service of the Lord. It is very astonishing that "Engaging the tongue I become perfect?" Yes. The beginning is the tongue, because tongue is the greatest enemy. People are going to hell on account of being unable to control the tongue. Therefore one has to control the tongue. And controlling tongue means you engage the tongue in the service of the Lord. How? Tongue means you can speak with your tongue and you can eat with your tongue. So engage the tongue chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is service. And tongue wants to taste. Give him //kṛṣṇa-prasādam,// very nice. So as soon as you engage your tongue in these two business, then naturally you become purified and your senses become also purified. Then you come to the real platform.

> sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ
> tat-paratvena nirmalaṁ
> hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-
> sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]

This is the //bhakti,// to engage the purified senses in the service of the master of senses, Hṛṣīkeśa. Hṛṣīkeśa means master. //Hṛṣika// means the senses, and //īśa// means master. Hṛṣīkeśa. Kṛṣṇa's another name is Hṛṣīkeśa.

So we have to engage our senses. It is not our senses; it is Kṛṣṇa's. We have forgotten it. I am seeing with my eyes. I am very much proud I can see. But why you cannot see when you are blind? The eyes are there. Because the master has withdrawn the sight power. You can be happy with your decoration of the eyes, but you cannot see. So actually I do not see. Just like I have got this spectacle. The spectacle does not see; I am seeing. Similarly, with my eyes I am not seeing; Kṛṣṇa is seeing. Because Kṛṣṇa is seeing, therefore I am seeing. This is the Vedic version, I will find in //Upaniṣad.// Because the Supreme Brahman is seeing, therefore we are seeing. Because the Brahman is walking... There are many evidences. Just like this ear. Now I am hearing with this ear. You are also hearing. But when I am unconscious, this ear is there, and you call me, "Mr. Mo..., Mr. Sir, Mr. Sir," but I cannot hear. The machine is there. Why you cannot hear? Therefore the Brahman is withdrawn.

So //sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahman// [Chāndogya Upaniṣad 3.14.1]. Everything is working because the Brahman is there. Otherwise it will not work; simply machine. This body, because the Brahman, the soul, is there, it is working. And as soon as the soul is out of this body, it is lump of matter. They are thinking the brain is working. The brain is not working. Brain is a machine. Just like typing. You are typing. The machine is not typing; you are typing. Unless there is touch of Brahman, nothing can work. So when we realize this, that is called //brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]], when we understand that "I am simply instrumental." That is also explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Bhramāyan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. Actually, we are under the direction of Kṛṣṇa, and He has given us this machine, this body, and we are wandering throughout the whole universe. //Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva.// This is our position. We have got this machine, and we are wandering throughout the universe in different planets and different forms of life, and we do not know what is the aim of life.

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva
> guru kṛṣṇa kṛpa pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

In this wandering, wandering, wandering, when we come in contact with a bona fide //guru,// we get the seed of devotional service. That is the aim of life, how to get that. Therefore the Vedic injunction is, //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. You must go. Otherwise your life is useless.

So it is the duty of //guru,// it is the duty of father, it is the duty of the government, it is duty of the elderly relative to educate everyone. This is human life, not that simply eating like dog and dancing like dog. This is not human civilization. So //sa kathaṁ nyarpitātmānaṁ kṛta-maitram acetanam.// If I think that "My spiritual master is here. He will save me," and if I do not train him how to save them, then what is the use of having such spiritual master? What is the use of having such father? And what is the use of such government? There is a Bengali poetry by a Bengali Vaiṣṇava: //janame janame sabe pitā mātā paya, kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhajaha e aya.//[?] As soon as you take birth, there is father. Either you take birth as a snake or you take birth as a human being, without father and mother there is no question of birth. So father and mother you will get in every birth. But //kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhajaha e aya//[?]: Kṛṣṇa and //guru// will not be available in every birth. That is very important thing. You cannot get Kṛṣṇa in the form of a snake or a cat and a dog, but you can get Kṛṣṇa in the form as a human being.

Therefore human being, this form of human being... //Labdhvā sudurlabham idaṁ bahu-sambhavānte// [SB 11.9.29]. After many, many millions of years we have got this human form of body. It should not be misused simply like cats and dogs. This is not success of life. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja, although he was five-years-old boy, he advised his class friend that //kaumāraṁ ācaret prājñaḥ.// He was instructing. He was a devotee. He was preaching, "My dear friend, you just become devotee of Kṛṣṇa." The children protested, "Eh! We shall now play or we shall become Kṛṣṇa conscious? No, no, we shall play." So Prahlāda Mahārāja repeatedly said, "No, no, no. Even we are children, we should not play. We should become Kṛṣṇa conscious." //Kaumāraṁ ācaret prājñaḥ.// If you are intelligent... //Kaumāraṁ. Kaumāram// means from the childhood, from five years. //Kaumāraṁ ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha.// "Why? All right, if you say that I shall become Kṛṣṇa conscious, I shall become. Let us grow now." No. //Durlabhaṁ mānuṣyaṁ janma tad api adhruvam arthadam// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. "No, no, no. Don't spoil your life in that way. It is... Although we have got this body, human form, but it is also //adhruvam.// It will not stay."

So before your next death you finish your Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the real gain of life. Don't wait, that "I shall become old, and when I shall become feeble---there is no more energy---then I shall become Kṛṣṇa conscious." Of course, Kṛṣṇa conscious, one can become in a moment perfect. But that is rarely done. Everyone should be taught Kṛṣṇa consciousness from the very childhood. This is human civilization.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
