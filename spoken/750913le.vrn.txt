//Vabhānu.// All the Vaiavas, and the Vrindavana residents are enthusiastic, to see Radharani on her appearance day. You have come from far and beyond for this. On this occasion we are trying to move forward a bit, today we are trying to do the foundation stone laying ceremony for the Gurukul. We will be very happy if you all participate in this. So Radharani’ service is "//bahu namau//"[?] Srimati Radharani was proficient in sixty-four arts, on how to make Krishna happy, this is Radharani. //rādhe jaya jaya mādhava-dayite.// That is why Krishna also is attracted by Radharani. The word Krishna means, one who attracts everybody, Krishna, and Krishna is attracted by Srimati Radharani. Krishna is known as Madana Mohana. Those who take shelter of Krishna, they are protected from the hands of Cupid. Sripad Yamunācārya has said in a //sloka,//

> yad-avadhi mama ceta ka-padāravinde
> nava-nava-rasa-dhāmany udyata rantum āsit
> tad-avadhi bata nāri-sagame smaryamāne
> bhavati mukha-vikāra suhu nihivana ca

Sripad Yamunācārya has said, "Since my mind has been engaged at the lotus feet of Lord Krishna, from that day onwards whenever I think of sex life, I spit at the thought." 

> tad-avadhi bata nāri-sagame smaryamāne
> bhavati mukha-vikāra

So the world is engrossed in sex life only, man and woman.

> yan maithunādi-ghamedhi-sukha hi tuccha
> kayanena karayor iva dukha-dukham
> tpyanti neha kpa bahu-dukha-bhāja

(Srila Prabhupada repeats: //bahu-dukha-bhāja//)

> kativan manasija viaheta dhira

The aim of human life is samyam[?], //sama, dama, satyam, saucam, jṣānam,// vijṣānam, //āstikya//---To control the senses. //Tapasya!// abhadeva says

> nāya deho deha-bhājā? n-loke
> ka?ān kāmān arhate vi-bhajā ye

He was imparting knowledge to His son, He says, "Son, this human life, this should not be like a hog’s life." What does a hog do? He works hard the whole day to eat stool and when his body is fat and juicy he enjoys sex with the opposite sex without any discrimination. The human life is not meant to be like this. What is it for? //Tapo,// to do //tapasya// and why the austerities? //Divyam,// to get connected with the Lord. Otherwise, Hirayakasipu, performed a lot of austerities, Rāvaa performed a lot of austerities, for sense gratification. Not that kind of austerity. //tapo divya, yena suddhyet sattvam//---austerity should be performed for the Lord in such a way that our existence is purified. Are we impure now, I have had a bath now! No this bath is not purifying. It will be purified when we are freed from the entanglement of birth, death, old age and disease. That is purity! This contamination, //bhûtvā bhûtvā praliyate,// we take birth, that ends and then we have to take birth again. This, what is the reason? Impure! Otherwise the living entity is part and parcel of the Supersoul, //na hanyate hanyamāne sarire.// Just like the Lord says, //ajo 'pi,// "I am unborn." Similarly the living entity because he is part and parcel of Krishna should also be unborn. But why is he born? Impure! Existence is not pure. To purify the existence, our Vedic civilization is only for purifying the existence, nothing else! Nowadays everything is topsy turvy. But our attempt is, this Krishna consciousness movement, //kiṣcit// (a little) attempt, how the human beings can accept Vedic culture. There is no attempt to take advantage of anyone. So I am trying to advance slowly. In Vrindavana, today we are inaugurating, the opening of the Gurukul, attempting to. We are not sure where the funds will come from and what will happen. But the foundation ceremony has been done. The aim of the Gurukul is that the children are taught the devotional service from the beginning. 

> kaumāra ācaret prājṣo dharmān bhāgavatān iha
> durlabha mānua janma tad apy adhruvam arthadam

Prahlāda Mahārāja would talk to the demon classmates of his, about the pastimes of the Lord, whenever he would get opportunity in between in his school. They were all children, they would say, "Prahlāda, come let us play and jump around. This is not the time to listen to the pastimes of the Lord." But he would say, "No! No! No!" Friends, //kaumāra ācaret prājṣo,// right from the childhood that is when one is four or five years old, he should learn //bhāgavata-dharma.// Why so quickly? //durlabha mānua janma,// this human life is rarely obtained and is //adhruvam,// this will not last long, also //Arthadam. Arthadam// means to get some riches or wealth. What is that wealth? To get connected with the Lord! This cannot be achieved in any other form of birth. The lion is very strong and powerful but he will never get the Lord. But a human being however weak he may be, if he is taught from the very beginning then he can get the Lord. //durlabha janma,// one should be taught from the beginning. There is no school or college in this whole world that teaches that "we are not this body." Everywhere it is taught that ‘you are this body, you are American, you are Indian, you are Hindu, you are Muslim.’ Just bodily identifications. 

> yasyātma-buddhi kupe tri-dhātuke
> sva-dhi kalatrādiu bhauma idyadhi
> sa eva gokhara.

//go// means cow and //khara// means ass, so this is a ass and cow civilization. Everyone is unhappy with this. Everyone is unhappy because of this //gokhara// civilization. No one is happy. That is why these people make one party, someone else makes another and so on but what work will get done? The real disease is bodily identification, that remains. This does not benefit anyone. Real welfare is done when they understand that, ‘we are not this body.’ 

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe 
> kaumāra yauvana jarā
> tathā dehāntara-prāptir

we have to accept another body, they don’t believe that once we leave this body we will get another body and till we accept a body we will have to suffer, whether we are rich or poor. To get a body means to suffer. This education is not imparted. 

So I will not take much of your time. One more attempt, ISKCON, International Society for Krishna, we have already opened a Gurukul in Dallas, Texas. There is much progress in that. Even the Education Member of the Government has come and given a certificate that " The happiness that I see in these children here, I have not seen in any other school and college." Why won’t they be happy! Krishna consciousness is such a thing! Lots of Christian priests, one priest, I was traveling from Los Angeles to Hawaii, one priest gentleman came up to me and said, "Swamiji, can I talk with you?" "Yes!" "Why I see your students so bright faced?" He was surprised by this. In the western countries everyone is full of anxiety. Western country, eastern or western, wherever it may be, all those in the material world are full of anxiety. There is a verse, a //sloka// of Prahlāda Mahārāja,

> tat sādhu manye ’sura-varya dehinā
> sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt

Those who have accepted the bodily designations, //asato mā sad gama,// it is a Vedic enjoin, do not remain in this temporary bodily designations. Go to the platform of eternity. //O tat sat.// So Prahlāda Mahārāja, has said, //asad-grahāt,// this material body which we have accepted and we are trying to engage in sense gratification, this will only increase our anxiety, there will be no benefit, //asad-grahāt.// Because we have accepted the false designations, how will the anxiety go? That is why Prahlāda Mahārāja has advised,

> hitvātma-pāta gham andha-kûpa vana gato yad dharim āúrayeta

So all these teachings are there in the scriptures but we do not adhere to them, this is the sad situation. So the Gurukul we have started in Texas the pictures are there, those who wish to see them can do so. It has progressed very much. So we wanted to have a Gurukul in Vrindavana also and the subject matter of Gurukul has been explained in the scriptures, our priest Pundarikji, please read it out to them. You read it out. Give him this microphone. Give him. You please come here. I am sending this priest to Texas. He is a very nice teacher, so we have organized a permit and passport for him. Just give him! [end]
