====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] ...parks here?

**Kartikeya:**
There are many small parks, but biggest park is here. One is at Kankariya, near the lake. That old lake is... A five-hundred-old lake is there.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is supposed to be the biggest.

**Kartikeya:**
Because here people are only after money, so they are not care to give charity for any park when it is [indistinct]. There is no private charity.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is the duty of the municipal. [break] ...program?

**Madhudviṣa:**
The whole thing was completely packed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who spoke?

**Devotee (1):**
Acyutānanda Mahārāja.

**Kartikeya:**
In Hindi.

**Prabhupāda:**
In Hindi?

**Kartikeya:**
For more than one hour.

**Harikeśa:**
In Hindi?

**Kartikeya:**
Yes. One hour he spoke. About ten percent English words, twenty-five percent Sanskrit, and rest in Hindi.

**Devotee (1):**
He spoke very nice.

**Kartikeya:**
People were very happy, and they could understand.

**Prabhupāda:**
Philosophy was presented nice?

**Madhudviṣa:**
Yes. Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
You spoke? No.

**Madhudviṣa:**
I spoke also, ten, fifteen minutes in the beginning.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [break] //...kīrtana viṣṇoḥ,// about Viṣṇu, not nonsense. [break] ...speak in Hindi, they will hear more.

**Kartikeya:**
Yes, they like it.

**Prabhupāda:**
You cannot speak Hindi?

**Girirāja:**
I can't give discourses.

**Kartikeya:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] "Yes, no, very good." You know this story, "Yes, no, very good"? No? There was one //kansakar.// So he was to go home, so he asked his friend that "So long I am not here, you serve European master." So he said, "I do not know English. How can I serve him?" "No, no, no. These three words will do: 'yes,' 'no,' 'very good.' " Then he was engaged. [laughs] One day from the master's room something was missing. So he asked the new servant, "You have taken it?" "Yes." [laughter] Then he asked him, "Return it." "No." [laughter] "Oh, then I shall hand you over to the police." "Very good." [laughter] Then when the police came, he was won..., "Sir, what is this? You have...?" "No, I do not know this." Then he was explained, that "I understand these three words only: 'yes, no, very good.' That's all." Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Kartikeya:**
[indistinct]

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
No, we have this place.

**Devotee (2):**
It's very wet. Very wet.

**Kartikeya:**
All wet in there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let us walk little more. Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// Oh, yes, it is very wet. We chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, everything will come out very good. But the rascals will not do that. That is the difficulty. They will make plan. [aside:] Which way? Kṛṣṇa's plan they will not take. That is the difficulty.

**Kartikeya:**
Is it because of the leaders are not following, therefore the population is not following?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Kartikeya:**
The wrong example is given?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ// [[books:bg:3:21|[Bg. 3.21]]]. If the leaders are rascals, therefore they are rascals. If father is rascal, the son is rascal. Therefore //Bhāgavata// says that "If you are a rascal, don't become a father." //Pita na sa syāt, na mocayed ya samupeta-mṛtyum// [[books:sb:5:5:18|[SB 5.5.18]]]. "If you are a rascal, don't become a mother." Stop population. They have therefore invented, "Yes, we shall become 'bachelor father,' 'bachelor daddy,' " not actual father but "bachelor father." Here woman at least think nowadays that she must have a husband. In the Western countries they don't think. "No, there is no need of husband." Am I right? Huh?

**Girirāja:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They don't think there is need of husband. Eh? But they feel. That I know. I have seen one girl, she saw another friend, "Oh, she has got a husband," whispering. So I can understand that everyone aspires after husband, but there is no hope. Hopelessness. This is the position. Every woman wants a good husband, good home, good children, little ornaments, nice food. That is the ambition of every woman. But they are hopeless. Although they are well qualified, European, American girls, they are hopeless, not to get any husband, not to get any home. This is their position. I have studied thoroughly. Is it not?

**Girirāja:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Hopelessness. When we see in our association all these girls, they are so nicely, well qualified. Whatever they are taught, they immediately pick up.

**Kartikeya:**
In America they were asking my wife how Indian women are able to keep such devotion for their husbands. So they are actually very much interested and envious of this situation in India.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is the nature. That is... They want to be a faithful wife, but there is no husband. Where to become faithful?

**Harikeśa:**
So then they want to become liberated.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Being hopeless repeatedly, now they want liberation. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.// [break] //Jaya.// [break] ...samājīs?

**Kartikeya:**
There are many. They fight with us. Even in the office, when they come, they speak quite ill words about many of our religious leaders and God. They are so much brainwashed, completely brainwashed. They call themselves Hindus, but they do not want to follow any God, only //brahma-tattva// or Brahman. They believe in the //Vedas...//

**Madhudviṣa:**
[indistinct]

**Kartikeya:**
...they follow the religious leader only.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Actually they are atheists.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nāstika.//

**Madhudviṣa:**
Like Vivekananda.

**Kartikeya:**
No, that man said they have muscular body and they have got muscularmind. That man was very much correct, absolutely. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Indian man (3):**

So we wish that this year also, if you spare some time, which time can be suitable to you. You are already booked for Rajasthan? After that are you staying here?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. What time? Seven to ten.

**Indian man (3):**
Seven to ten you are at Rajasthan's house.

**Prabhupāda:**
So before that, we can go?

**Indian man (3):**
Before that, our merchants, they generally return from market at about 8:30 or 8. Tomorrow is Sunday. You are not free... You are leaving tomorrow.

**Kartikeya:**
He is leaving by 8:30.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tomorrow morning?

**Indian man (3):**
Tomorrow morning you are leaving.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, so tomorrow morning, if you arrange, we can leave some other time. Tomorrow morning.

**Indian man (3):**
So you can postpone your going tomorrow?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Tomorrow morning, if you can, then we can go in the evening. No?

**Girirāja:**
There's a flight at 4:30, but I think some of the... We informed the devotees you were coming, and I think many important people might be coming Sunday evening to meet you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. All right. Then what can be done?

**Indian man (3):**
[Hindi]

**Harikeśa:**
Maybe they can come to the //paṇḍāl.//

**Indian man (5):**
It may be impossible. Impossible.

**Girirāja:**
So next time.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, next.

**Indian man (6):**
Next time. When next you hope to come?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, after a month.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
We will be here. Some of our disciples will be here, so you can...

**Indian man (6):**
Where we can find them?

**Kartikeya:**
We'll be there, at Ideal House. You can write down. They are residing there. All of them can come afterwards.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Only Guru Mahārāja and two, three other disciples are going.

**Kartikeya:**
Two people are going. We are continuing the program even at Rajana-samithi for three more days. At that time you can come in the afternoon, or we can give any other....

**Indian man (6):**
So they are staying for one month.

**Kartikeya:**
Not one month, but I hope to be at least one more week.

**Girirāja:**
I think tomorrow would be the best day for a group of devotees to come. [break]

[in car]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā, amāninā mānadena kīrtanīya sadā hariḥ.// This is the process to become very humble.

**Kartikeya:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā.// [Hindi]

> tṛṇād api sunīcena
> taror api sahiṣṇunā
> amāninā mānadena
> kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ
> [[books:cc:adi:17:31|[Cc. Ādi 17.31]]]

[Hindi] To become humble, this is a qualification. [Hindi] This humbleness is a good qualification. [Hindi conversation] //...crores// of..., millions of dollars spent... [Hindi conversation] Detroit, I saw that bridge? There is barrier?

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, yes. Er...

**Prabhupāda:**
San Diego.

**Brahmānanda:**
San Diego.

**Prabhupāda:**
San Diego. [Hindi] Or I saw the Berkeley also, that tower?

**Brahmānanda:**
Glass is there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Glass there. So [Hindi] suicide... [Hindi conversation] You want immediately to become like America. [Hindi]

**Indian man (7):**
Should we go back to the bullock cart age?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Certainly. Then you will be //sukhī.// [Hindi]

> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij

[Hindi] This is the first instruction: //dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. [Hindi] This is the first instruction. [Hindi] This is the first instruction. [Hindi] This is the first to be given up in order to understand spiritual knowledge. [Hindi] So how you can expect tranquility and peacefulness if the society is conducted by //go-khara?// This is the defect. [Hindi] This is the rule, nature's law. And if it is a fact... It is a fact. You believe or not believe; that is a different thing. [Hindi] Professor Kotovsky... [break] "Swāmījī, after death, everything is finished." He said like that. And he is a big professor of Indology. [Hindi] //...sa eva go-kharaḥ// [SB 10.84.13]. He is a professor. [long Hindi conversation] Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda.

[break] [on walk again]

**Prabhupāda:**

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

[Hindi conversation] You cannot do anything. You cannot be educated at home. You must go to the teacher. [Hindi] And they are being eulogized. [Hindi]

**Kartikeya:**
Now their own president is not free from danger. Every day shooting is going on. [indistinct] [passerby chanting //ślokas//]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa [end]
