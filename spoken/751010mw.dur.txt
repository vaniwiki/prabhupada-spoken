====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
You are scientist? Ask them, "Don't come here." What is the use of scientist? Hmm? If they cannot stop... Stop it. Not only stop it; if the sea likes, it can overflow the whole thing.

**Devotee:**
//Haribol.// [laughter]

**Prahupada:**
But it came up to here. [heavy waves coming in] Like this or...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
No. It is very bad weather last few days. A storm must be in the neighborhood.

**Dhīrāṅga:**
There was one powerful king of England, he felt that just by his command he could hold back the tide. So he went and sat on the beach on his throne, and he commanded the sea not to come in. But of course the sea came in and washed him away. He was very embarrassed. King Canute. He became so puffed-up.

**Devotee:**
There's some steps here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It might be very soft.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this "adventure"?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
This is an ice cream advertisement. [break] Very respected person. //Unkulunkulu// means the most respected amongst all respected persons. This is how they address God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. [end]
