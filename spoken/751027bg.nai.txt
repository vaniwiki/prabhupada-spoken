====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.1 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> śrī bhagavān uvāca
> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

Kṛṣṇa, Bhagavān, the Supreme... Bhagavān means... //Bhaga// means opulence. Just like we use the word //bhāgyavān.// From this //bhāgya,// "fortune," comes from the word //bhaga.// So personally the Supreme Bhāgyavān, or Bhagavān... Bhagavān is never unfortunate. If somebody claims that he is Bhagavān, but Bhagavān is never unfortunate. He is always fortunate. //Saṇṇām iti bhaga iṅganā// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. There are six kinds of opulences. Which one possesses in full, He is called Bhagavān. There is meaning.

So we have several times explained: //aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, because He is the proprietor of all wealth, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram,// He is the proprietor of all the planets, all the universes, so who can be fortunate than Him? //Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. If you have got one //lakh// shillings or one ten //lakh// shillings, we think we have become very rich. But Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram:// "I am the proprietor of all the planets." So who can become richer than Him? Therefore He is Bhagavān. The highest rich man, the richest person, is called Bhagavān. Nobody can claim that he is the richest. That is not possible. So one who claims that "I am the richest. Nobody is equal to Me, and nobody is greater than Me," He is Bhagavān. //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "Nobody is greater than Me." That is Bhagavān. Bhagavān cannot be so cheap that anyone can claim that "I am God. I am Bhagavān." That is cheating. He must prove first of all that he is the richest of everyone. Not only richest, //aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya,// in strength also. //Vīryasya. Vīryasya yaśasaḥ,// also reputation.

Now, Kṛṣṇa is, at least in this material world, in this planet, everyone knows Kṛṣṇa. Who is such a person who is so famous all over the world? Especially since we have started this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, anywhere we go, they chant "Hare Kṛṣṇa." As soon as they us..., see us, our men, jokingly or seriously they chant "Hare Kṛṣṇa." When I was first coming to Nairobi from London, the plane stopped at Athens at twelve o'clock at night. So we got down and was in the public room, and some young men, immediately they began to chant "Hare Kṛṣṇa," at twelve o'clock. [laughter] So Kṛṣṇa is so famous at twelve o'clock in Athens even. Who is such a person within this world? This is Bhagavān. //Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ. Yaśaḥ// mean reputation. He is so reputed. Anywhere Kṛṣṇa is known.

So //yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ. Śriya,// beauty. Kṛṣṇa is so beautiful, nobody can surpass Him. //Kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobham// [Bs. 5.30]. Although He is blackish, but He is so beautiful He enchants the most beautiful, Rādhārāṇī. So //aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. //Śrī// means beauty. He is so beautiful; therefore His name is Kṛṣṇa. On account of His beauty, He attracts everyone. Beauty attracts. So nobody can be more beautiful than Kṛṣṇa. //Aiśvaryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ,// and //jñāna.// Not only He is beautiful... Just like a flower, very beautiful to see but no good smell, no aroma---useless. So Kṛṣṇa is not only beautiful but He is the most wise. He spoke //Bhagavad-gītā.// Five thousand years ago He spoke. Still big, big scholars, religionists, philosophers, they are studying. This is called //jñāna. Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ, jñāna// and //vairāgya. Vairāgya// means renouncement.

So Kṛṣṇa claims that He is the proprietor of all the planet, but if you think, "Where is Kṛṣṇa? Let me find out. He is the proprietor," oh, that you cannot find out. //Vairāgya.// Although He is the proprietor of all the planets, you won't find Him within this material world, although His authority is going on. Just like the president of your country is not to be seen everywhere, but his authority is going on. //Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. Everything is situated on Kṛṣṇa's opulence, but not that you will find Kṛṣṇa there. You will find Kṛṣṇa there when you are advanced. Otherwise you will not find. //Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa is situated in everything, but still, you cannot see in Kṛṣṇa unless you have got eyes to see. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement: to give you the eyes to see Kṛṣṇa everywhere. So how this thing can be done?

So if you are serious, then you can see Kṛṣṇa. So that Kṛṣṇa is advising in this verse in the Seventh Chapter, or throughout the whole //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa is instructing us how to understand Him. That is our only business. This human form of life is meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa, because we are very thickly related with Kṛṣṇa, just like father and the son. This relation cannot be broken. Maybe son is out of home, son may have forgotten, but Kṛṣṇa, the supreme father, He does not forget. He comes. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. So Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He has come to explain Himself, what He is. We should take advantage of it, because this human form of life is meant for understanding Kṛṣṇa. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// That is the //Vedānta-sūtra.// "Now you should inquire of the Absolute Truth." In the //Bhāgavata// also it is said, //jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā yaś ceha karmabhiḥ// [[books:sb:1:2:10|[SB 1.2.10]]]. //Jīvasya,// all living entities, especially the human being, his only business is inquire about the absolute knowledge, Kṛṣṇa.

But we are missing the opportunity. Nature has given us the opportunity, possessing this human form of body after evolution, 8,300,000 [sic] different types of bodies, but there is no cultivation of this knowledge how this evolution is taking place, how many different species of life there are. We can see, but we don't see very seriously. I see there is a tree in front of my house and it is also a living entity; I am also living entity. I have got very nice house, apartment, living very comfortably, and the other living being, the tree, a few yards from me, he cannot move an inch. He has to stand up in scorching heat, in cold. He cannot protest. If you cut, he cannot cry. Of course, he feels, but he cannot do anything. This is also life and I am also life, so why these differences? But they do not consider, "How he has got this life, and how I have got this life?" There is no university education wherefrom they are coming. No knowledge. Still, they are passing on as great scientist, great philosopher. This is the position.

So our real business is to understand Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa is explaining Himself. Then there is no difficulty. If you want to know me, you can imagine so many things: "Swāmījī may be this. Swāmījī may be that, like that, like this, like that." They are all imperfect. But if I tell you about myself openly, that "I am like this," then your knowledge is perfect. Everyone says, "There is no God." Somebody says, "God is there, but He has no form," and somebody says, "He has any form you like. Imagine any form." In this way speculation is going on all over the world. Actually they are not interested in God. That is the plain simple thing. They do not want to know God, and they think there is no need of understanding. But that is the only need---to understand God. That they do not know. Therefore they are called fools and rascals, //mūḍha. Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.// So Kṛṣṇa therefore left His instruction behind Him that "These //mūḍhas,// rascals, after studying //Bhagavad-gītā// they may understand Me. I am keeping behind Me."

So we should take advantage of //Bhagavad-gītā.// And even though we take advantage, we interpret in a different way. The same business is going on, how to kill Kṛṣṇa. Instead of understanding Kṛṣṇa, the endeavor is going on to kill Kṛṣṇa. //Asura.// Just like Kaṁsa. He was always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. His sister was pregnant, and it is foretold that "The eighth child of your sister will kill you." So he was thinking of Kṛṣṇa, that "The eighth child...," but with a purpose to kill Him. That is the business of the //asuras,// how to wipe out Kṛṣṇa, Kaṁsa philosophy. So we haven't got to follow Kaṁsa philosophy. We have to follow Kṛṣṇa philosophy. Then our life will be successful. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. //Ānukūlyena,// favorably, favorably to think of Kṛṣṇa. As Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. This is favorable. Kṛṣṇa never said that "Like My uncle Kaṁsa, you think of Me, how to kill Me." Kṛṣṇa does not say that. Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru.// That will make your life successful.

So here also Kṛṣṇa says,

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

"My dear Arjuna, I have already explained in the Sixth Chapter that to become first-class //yogī...//" When Arjuna was advised by Kṛṣṇa to become //yogī, haṭha-yogī... Haṭha-yogī// means to train the mind how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. The mind is disturbed always. This way, that way, mind is going, //cañcala,// restless. So the //haṭha-yoga// system is meant for persons who are too much under the bodily conception of life, that "I am this body." For them the //haṭha-yoga// is there so that by practicing several sitting posture, controlling the mind, controlling the senses, they can concentrate on Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord. This is //yoga// system. This is real //yoga// system. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. Who is the //yogī?// He is //yogī// who in meditation, //dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā,// always thinking of Kṛṣṇa by the mind. And gradually, when he is perfect in //samādhi,// trance, he can see Kṛṣṇa.

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.38]

Śyāmasundara. You have come to this temple. Here is Śyāmasundara's form. You see always. Come as many times as you like. See the //ārati.// Hear the //kīrtana.// See the Deity nicely dressed. In this way the impression of God will be within your mind. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena.// And when you have got this impression, if you always meditate upon Kṛṣṇa as Kṛṣṇa advises, //man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ, man-manāḥ,// "Always think of Me," that is the perfect //yoga// system.

Therefore, at the end of the Sixth Chapter Kṛṣṇa says, //yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā:// "Of all the //yogīs...//" The Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna was talking. Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna to become a //yogī,// but Arjuna said that "Kṛṣṇa, it is not possible for me. Because I am a politician, I am a soldier, I cannot sit down to practice //yoga// superficially. My mind will be disturbed in political affairs, in state affairs." So, //cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa pramāthi balavad dṛḍham// [[books:bg:6:34|[Bg. 6.34]]]: "My mind is so restless, it is not possible." Then Kṛṣṇa, to encourage him, said,

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

"Anyone who is thinking of Me always," //mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā śraddhāvān sa me yuktatamaḥ,// "he is the first-class //yogī.//"

So we are trying to make our students the first-class //yogī,// always think of Kṛṣṇa. This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And Kṛṣṇa is also saying the same thing, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogam.// How you can think of Kṛṣṇa always? That is not possible unless you become too much addicted. Just like if you love somebody, then you can think of him always. Artificially, if I say, "You think of Mr. John always," how you'll be possible? Artificially it is not possible. If you have got some love for Mr. John as a friend, as a lover or as somebody, or son or master or something, then you can think of Mr. John always. Otherwise it is not possible. So that thinking you can revive.

There is relationship with you, with Kṛṣṇa. So you have to revive that relationship. It is not artificial. Just like these European, American boys, Kṛṣṇa was unknown to them. They are coming from Christian, Jews. So what they had to do with the Kṛṣṇa? They had nothing to do, but why they are mad after Kṛṣṇa? They are no longer mad after anything. They have given up everything. Simply for preaching in your country they have come here. They have not come as a businessman to exploit African resources like other Europeans. They have come to distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why? Why the responsibility they have taken? Because they have learned to love Kṛṣṇa. This is the basic principle. Anyone can understand. Otherwise, do you think they are poor men? They have come here to earn some money? They are not poor men. The Americans are the richest country. Any third-class man, he earns there 400,000's rupees, any third-class man, and what to speak of the first-class man. This is America. The lowest pay to a person, whatever qualification, he has, must be at least four thousand dollars. This is their law. So how they can be poor? There is no question of poverty in America. Nobody thinks, "What shall I do next? I have no money." Money is there on the street. Go and take it and spend. So why they have come here, taking so much troubles? Because they love Kṛṣṇa, therefore they have come. This is the... //Mayy āsakta. Āsakta,// attached.

So we have to increase the attachment. Kṛṣṇa is already attractive, but we are trying to go away from Kṛṣṇa. This is our business. "Kṛṣṇa may not touch me." We are so clever that "Kṛṣṇa may not touch me." This is //māyā.// Big, big scholars, big, big politicians, they are writing comments on Kṛṣṇa's book, //Bhagavad-gītā,// but their aim is very acute, that "Kṛṣṇa may not touch me." This is going on. And then why they are writing on Kṛṣṇa's book? Now, that is their business. Because this book, //Gītā,// is very famous, so if they can distribute their nonsense philosophy through //Gītā,// it will be taken very easily. Otherwise they do not know Kṛṣṇa; they do not know what is //Bhagavad-gītā.// But they take advantage of the popularity of //Bhagavad-gītā// and push their nonsense philosophy through //Bhagavad-gītā.// The purpose is to kill Kṛṣṇa, Kaṁsa philosophy. So then, that way, they'll never get Kṛṣṇa. They'll never understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says that "If you want to know Me," //asaṁśayaṁ samagram,// "if you want to know Me in full, completely, without any doubt, then you have to follow this //yoga// system," //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// Otherwise it is not possible.

So all these nonsense speculators... We use purposefully "nonsense," because they have no sense, simply speculating. God is unlimited. How you...? Your mind is limited. What you can speculate? "May be like this, may be like that," that's all. "Perhaps it is like this." All simply theoretical. It is never possible to know Kṛṣṇa, God, perfectly and completely by the speculating method. It is not possible. If you want to know Kṛṣṇa, or God---when we speak of Kṛṣṇa: God---so then Kṛṣṇa's formula must be followed, as it is said here, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// The principal factor is to become attached to Kṛṣṇa. Attached means become a lover of Kṛṣṇa. Then you can understand //asaṁśayam,// without any doubt. Without any doubt. Otherwise you will find there are so many hundreds of religious system all over the world. Ask anyone who are their follower, "Do you know what is God?" They'll never be able to answer clearly, because they do not know God. And if you do not know God, then what is the meaning of your religion?

Religion means to know God. //Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. One must know God, and one must know what God desires. That is religion. Just like you must know your government, and you must know what government wants, expects from you. If you do that, then you are a good citizen. And if you don't know what is government, if you do not know what government desires, expects from you, then what is the meaning of your good citizenship? There is no meaning. Similarly, to become religious without any clear understanding of God is bogus, is cheating. That is cheating. That is not religion. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said that "If you want to know Me," //asaṁśayam,// "without any doubt..." God may be personal, impersonal, or this, that, but you must know it perfectly well. Don't say, "Perhaps it may be like this. Perhaps may be like this." That is imperfect knowledge. That is no knowledge. So therefore Kṛṣṇa personally says, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan.// This is a //yogī.// This is the first-class //yogī.// Kṛṣṇa has explained that //yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ sa me yukta...// [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]. So //śraddhāvān bhajate yo mām,// one who is worshiping Kṛṣṇa with //śraddhā,// with faith, complete faith, //bhajate,// and serving Him... So who is that person? A devotee. Without being a devotee, how with faith and adherence and reverence and obedience you can serve Kṛṣṇa unless you love Kṛṣṇa?

So //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha.// We have got attraction for so many things in this material world. Somebody has got attraction for his family, somebody has got attraction for his wife, children, or somebody has got attraction for some sporting, or somebody has attraction for his country, so on, so on. We have got attraction. That is not a new thing. We have got attraction, but we have got attraction in different subject matter, material. So this //yoga// system, //bhakti-yoga// system, means you should be only attracted by Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. Attraction is there. Nobody can say that "I have no attraction for anything." That is false. Everyone has got attraction. If you have nothing to be attracted, then you keep a cat and a dog to be attracted. That is the nature. Especially in the Western countries we see. He has no family, but he keeps one pet dog or pet cat because he wants to be attracted by somebody. This is nature.

So here Kṛṣṇa says that "You have got already attraction, but in false things which will not exist. You turn that attraction unto Me. Then you'll get pleasure." You are attracted to something for getting some pleasure. So that pleasure is interrupted because we have posed our attraction in some false things. You have to change that attraction to the real thing, Kṛṣṇa. Then you'll be happy. //Mayy āsakta. Mayy āsakta. Mayi:// "Unto Me," Kṛṣṇa says personally. If you... Attraction means you have to engage your mind. //Mayy āsakta-manāḥ.// Attraction does not come in the air. The mind, mind fully engaged in something, is called attraction. So this is //yoga, bhakti-yoga.// And this //yoga// has to be executed... Kṛṣṇa says, //mad-āśrayaḥ:// "You have to execute this //yoga// system, taking shelter of Me." "Me" means either Kṛṣṇa Himself or His representative. Just like Kṛṣṇa says in the Fourth Chapter, //evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. So you have to learn this //bhakti-yoga// directly under Kṛṣṇa or under the direction of Kṛṣṇa's representative. So if you do this, then //asaṁśaya,// without any doubt, and //samagram,// in completeness, //mayy āsakta, asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. So Kṛṣṇa will explain, item by item, how you can increase your attraction for Kṛṣṇa. Then you will be able to execute the //bhakti-yoga// system under the guidance of Kṛṣṇa directly or directed by His representative. Then it will be successful.

So one of the Kṛṣṇa's representatives, Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī, he has defined how this attachment can be increased. He has explained, //ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]. //Ādau śraddhā.// Just like you have come here with some //śraddhā,// some faith. This is required. And you have to increase this //śraddhā,// this faith, more and more. How it can be increased? //Sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]], to intermingle with the persons who are engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ. Sādhu// means who is a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise he is not //sādhu.// Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, api cet su-durācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. That is //sādhu.// You cannot create //sādhu// unless he is devotee of Kṛṣṇa. //Bhajate mām ananya-bhāk.// He is //sādhu.// So if you want to increase your advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you have to intermingle with the person who is //sādhu,// who are //sādhu,// mean devotees. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ.// But //sādhu-saṅgaḥ...// Then gradually you will be inclined to execute devotional service as the //sādhus// are doing---chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// offering //ārati,// offering foodstuff, dressing, so many things. //Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyam...// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]].

The nine different types of methods, that is called //bhajana-kriyā.// And //ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā tato 'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]. Then //anartha,// all unwanted things which you have learned unfortunately, that will be finished. If you mix with, intermingle with //sādhu,// then you will be purified, and things which are not required at all---artificially you have learned by bad association---that will be... //Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.// Nobody learns to smoke from the very birth. He has to eat something. He drinks milk, the child. He doesn't say, "Give me a cigarette," but you have learned it by bad association. This is called //anartha.// You have learned it, drinking tea, coffee, not from the beginning of your life but by bad association. Then this is //anartha.// So if you engage yourself in devotional service, then these things will disappear automatically. You'll find in our temple, we are cooking so many nice preparations. Perhaps you have tasted some of them. But we are not preparing tea or coffee or meat---nothing. These are //anarthas.// What is the necessity?

So //anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.// Then you become purified. Then you become... When //anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt,// when you are free from all these unwanted nonsense things---illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating... This is //anartha.// Then you, being purified, then your faith in Kṛṣṇa becomes confirmed. //Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt. Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'thato bhajana-kriyā anartha-nivṛttiḥ..., tato niṣṭhā.// Then you become firmly fixed up: "Yes, I shall continue, Kṛṣṇa." //Niṣṭhā.// How this //niṣṭhā,// artificial? No. //Ruci,// taste. You cannot do without Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is called //tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ bhāvaḥ,// "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is so exalted." //sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]. This is the step-by-step increasing perfection of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And when you are on the perfectional stage of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then your human life is perfect. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Reduce sex. Because material life means sex. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. In the material world, not only in the human society but also in the birds, beast, animal, insect, everywhere the sex impulse is very strong. And if you indulge in sex life, then you'll be complicated more and more in this material body. This is the law of nature. Therefore whole Vedic civilization is meant for curtailing sex life. First of all //brahmacārī,// no sex life. First of all training is //brahmacārī,// how to train him to remain without sex. That is //brahmacārī. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. //Tapasya// means to remain //brahmacārī.// This is //tapasya.// It is very difficult. Therefore it is called //tapasya,// because the whole world is attracted by sex life, //puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]], whole world---not only in this planet, every planet, even in the demigods' planet.

So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means not bodily consciousness. The material world means bodily consciousness: how to keep the body in comfortable. But that is not possible. Body means misery. You cannot keep it comfortable. That is //māyā.// It will never be comfortable, but they are all trying to make it comfortable. This is called //māyā. Kleśada āsa dehaḥ.// So long you'll have a material body you'll have to suffer. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not on the bodily platform. It is on the spiritual platform. To come to the spiritual platform, it is necessary that you reduce or make nil sex life. So if one remains //brahmacārī// throughout the whole life it becomes very easy for him to go back to home, back to Godhead. This is the secret. Therefore the whole Vedic civilization is based on first of all //brahmacārī,// no sex life. //Gṛhastha,// that is also very regulated. Only for begetting child one can have sex life, father, mother, man and woman. So //dharmāviruddho kāmo 'smi.// In the //Bhagavad-gītā// you will find Kṛṣṇa says that "Sex life which is prescribed by the religious system, that is, I am." Otherwise it is illicit sex. So illicit sex, there is punishment. These things are there.

So //tapasya// means //tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena vā// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. You have to control. The more one controls, he becomes advanced in spiritual culture. The //yoga// system means //yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ. Yoga// means how to control the senses. This is //yoga// system. And therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha.// So sex indulgence is against spiritual advancement of life. Therefore you have seen that the //brahmacārīs,// they go; there it becomes very easy to enter into the spiritual kingdom. So that you can do here also. If you increase your attraction for Kṛṣṇa, then naturally you lose attraction for sex. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's name is Madana-mohana. //Madana// means sex life. He can enchant even //madana.//

So these are things which the devotee will learn by studying the literature. But even without studying, if you sincerely chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// under regulation, everything---all good qualification---will come.

**Devotee (1):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that if we asked the other religious sects what is God... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Nothing to do with any physiological, anatomical. We have to see that we are advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we have to eat something. We have to eat the remnants of foodstuff taken by Kṛṣṇa. //Prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hānir asyopajāyate// [[books:bg:2:65|[Bg. 2.65]]]. That is our policy. We do not see to the physiological, anatomical condition. That is not our business. That is automatically done.

**Devotee (2):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, Brahmā is mentioned in Kṛṣṇa consciousness as the first living entity. And in the Bible we say the same thing, that Adam and Eve [indistinct]. Now, my question is that in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is there any part where they mention Adam and Eve in Kṛṣṇa consciousness?

**Brahmānanda:**
He says that according to Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy, the first living being was Brahmā, and in the Christian Bible it says Adam was the first man. So he wants to know if in Kṛṣṇa consciousness scriptures there is any mention of Adam.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why you want to tally with Bible and Kṛṣṇa conscious literature? Do you think that Kṛṣṇa conscious literature has to tally with Bible? There is, that "There is first living being, Brahmā," and Brahmā was also married couple. So you can take it as Adam and Eve. That's all. [laughter] Why do you want cent percent tally? But this nonsense theory, that there was a monkey first of all, [laughter] in Darwin's theory, and from monkey, human being has come, this is nonsense. So any other question?

**Indian man (1):**
Swāmījī, some religions, the //guru,// if someone wants to be his disciple, he is being given a sort of beads by the //guru// himself. Is it possible to get beads through Your Worship?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is our process. When we accept a disciple we give him beads, we give him direction.

**Indian man (2):**
This //mantra// we chant for Kṛṣṇa and Rāma both, but this movement glorifies the Kṛṣṇa's pastimes and not much of Rāma.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, there is... Vaiṣṇavas... //Rāmāyaṇa// is also approved. //Rāmāyaṇa// is also Vedic literature, Vālmīki //Rāmāyaṇa,// not any other. So we discuss Vālmīki //Rāmāyaṇa.// In the //Bhāgavata// there is discussion about Rāmacandra's activities. So we are giving //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// There is Rāmacandra's activities there. Where is Rāmacandra, which planet He is now, that is also described in the //Bhāgavatam.// So it is not that we are without Rāma. And our direct worshipable Rāma is Balarāma, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. We have opened the temple of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma in Vṛndāvana. So Rāma is there.

//Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu// [Bs. 5.39]. Kṛṣṇa has got many, many incarnation. Rāma is also one of them. So when we speak of Kṛṣṇa, it means including all the incarnation---Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha---everything. //Rāmādi...// Therefore //rāmādi,// "taking Rāma as the original," //mūrtiṣu,// "in such forms," //rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan,// "He is existing." Kṛṣṇa is not alone. He is always existing with His different incarnations---Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, Matsya, Kūrma---so many. So either you worship Kṛṣṇa or Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, Matsya, Kūrma, anyone you can worship. We don't say that don't worship Rāma. We never say, because Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, the same. We shall... In future we have got a hope we shall start a Rāma-Lakṣmaṇa //mūrti,// yes, in some temple. That is our worshipable Deity. We have got in my room Lord Rāmacandra's //mūrti,// Sītā-Rāma. So it is not that we are neglecting worship of Rāmacandra. There is. Yes? Somebody else?

**Guest (3):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is controller of everything, whole universe, everything. So why He is having these demigods to help Him? Because He's controller, He has got power to control whole universe, and why there are all these demigods [indistinct]? Why He can't control over this universe?

**Prabhupāda:**
He can control everyone, but He has given little freedom that He does not interfere the freedom given to you. Otherwise, He can control. Just like in //Bhagavad-gītā// you will find, after explaining //Bhagavad-gītā// to Arjuna, He is giving the freedom to Arjuna, //yathecchasi tathā kuru// [[books:bg:18:63|[Bg. 18.63]]]: "Whatever you like, you do." He is supreme controller, He can force him to do it, but He doesn't do that. The little independence you have got, you have to utilize it favorably. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You do this." He can forcibly make me to do that, but He doesn't do that, because He has given little independence, and He wants that voluntarily we surrender, not by force. That is wanted. Otherwise it is not that He cannot control you. He can control everyone.

**Devotee (4):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we are preaching to Christian people or to Muslim people, is there advantage in being familiar with their scriptures, or simply //Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?//

**Prabhupāda:**
We are not preaching to Christian or Hindu or Muslim. We are preaching to human being. We do not see, "Here is a Christian. Here is a Muslim. Here is a Hindu. Here is a white man. Here is a black man." No. Every living being, his duty is to understand God. This is our preaching. This is our preaching, that "You are living being. You are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. This designation, that 'You are Hindu,' 'You are Muslim,' 'You are Christian,' 'You are this'---these are all designations. Actually you are living being, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore your main duty is to understand Kṛṣṇa." This is our preaching. We are not going to convert Hindu into Muslim, Muslim into Christian. No, that is not our... That is not our business. He may think that he is Christian, he is Hindu, he is Muslim, but we think that he is a spirit soul, part and parcel of God. That is stated in the //Bha...//:

> vidyā-vinaya-sampanne
> brāhmaṇe gavi hastini
> śuni caiva śva-pāke ca
> paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]

If one is learned //paṇḍita,// he does not see Hindu, Muslim, Christian. I went to America. I did not go there to turn the Christian to become Hindu. No, I never said that. Did I say, any, anyone, that "You are Christian. You become a Hindu"? No, never I said. That is not my business.

**Indian man (4):**
Just now you said we are all part and parcel of God. What would you say is God?

**Prabhupāda:**
That we have explained, what is God. //Asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. You have to become God conscious. Then you will understand what is God. It is not a so trifle thing you ask me and, one minute, you understand God. That is foolishness. You have to study the science of God. God is not so cheap.

> manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu
> kaścid yatati siddhaye
> yatatām api siddhānāṁ
> kaścin vetti māṁ tattvataḥ
> [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]

Out of many thousands of men, one wants to become perfect, and out of many millions of perfect men, one can understand God. So God is not so cheap thing. Therefore Kṛṣṇa recommends,

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

If you want to know God without any doubt, completely, then you have to adopt this //yoga.// So first of all come to the //yoga.// Then speak of God understanding. It is not so cheap thing.

**Guest (5):**
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the oldest teaching of God, or Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is //mayy āsakta-manāḥ.// That is explained.

**Guest (5):**
But the //Gītā// was written about five thousand years ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. You have not read //Bhagavad-gītā.// Did you read? Did you read //Bhagavad-gītā?//

**Guest (5):**
Yes, I read some portion.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why do you say like that, five thousand years?

**Guest (5):**
All the scriptures were written five thousands ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? What does he say?

**Guest (5):**
Then how come in the locational[?], archaeological and ontological records, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not mentioned like other religions?

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa consciousness is always there. You are calculating with reference to your age, but Kṛṣṇa consciousness is there. In the Fourth Chapter you read, //imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]: "I spoke this Kṛṣṇa consciousness science first of all to the sun-god." Then how do you say five thousand years? And there is reference to the Manu. And if we take the, all these advanced calculation, then it becomes that forty millions of years ago //Bhagavad-gītā// was spoken by Kṛṣṇa to the sun-god. Have you got forty millions' history? [laughter] You haven't got even five thousand years' even history. Your history is so imperfect. So don't bring it into historical reference. It is eternal. [end]
