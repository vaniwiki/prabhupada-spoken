====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...not whimsically. That will not. That is a bad example.

**Dr. Patel:**
Oh, yes. Otherwise it will become a hotel.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dr. Patel:**
Otherwise it will become a hotel.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Hotel we are preparing also, transcendental hotel. But they must pay for it.

**Dr. Patel:**
That's right. I think it is perfectly right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise what will be the impression of the //sādhus,// that one treatment to one and one treatment to others? [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...require, everything is there by God's arrangement. [break] ...heavy load, there is elephant, truck. Elephant is truck, horse is carriage. Everything is there by nature's... And for small load, the bulls, the asses. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Where he is? He has gone back? In the kitchen they are preparing tea?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I beg your pardon?

**Prabhupāda:**
They are preparing tea in the kitchen?

**Brahmānanda:**
Tea. Was he making tea in his kitchen?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I didn't know that. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So Nanda-kumāra, you see me. I shall talk with you at half past eleven. [break] ...from this side. [break] ...flies. So do the modern botanists, er, biologists know all these things? In our //śāstra// it is, //jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthavarā lakṣa-viṁśati, kṛmayo rudra-śaṅkhyakaḥ// [//Padma Purāna//]. [break]

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
They cannot understand one species of life. How can they understand 8,400,000?

**Prabhupāda:**
And //śāstra// has described so many things. It has no value. And whatever nonsense they'll talk, that is right.

**Harikeśa:**
That's because the //śāstra// is not very practical.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Harikeśa:**
It's not very practical.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not practical?

**Harikeśa:**
Because you can't do anything with it. You just read it and...

**Prabhupāda:**
He can press your throat and kill you immediately. [laughter] He can do this. Do you admit or not?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Then? That is the practical thing for the demons. //Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham// [[books:bg:10:34|[Bg. 10.34]]]. When Hiraṇyakaśipu met with Nṛsiṁha-deva, "Yes, sir. Yes. You are here."

**Harikeśa:**
But that's all mythology. That kind of thing never really happens.

**Prabhupāda:**
When it happens, you will see. Wait for few years. Do you think death will not happen to you? You are so fool to think like that?

**Harikeśa:**
It's still going to happen to me even if I read these books.

**Prabhupāda:**
The books are there, what is happening actually, that's all. Books... Therefore it is practical, because what is written in the //śāstra,// that is happening. Therefore it is practical. [break] Throughout this age, the symptoms of Kali-yuga, they are happening practically. [break]

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
...all the Māyāvādīs, transcendentalists, they also don't believe in //śāstras.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
This one man, he is a great devotee of one so-called //swāmī,// and he was quoting //Bhagavad-gītā// inside and out. And then...

**Prabhupāda:**
He doesn't believe in.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
No. He doesn't believe in Kṛṣṇa. He comes to the words that "You surrender everything to Kṛṣṇa." Then he says, "Well, actually this //Bhagavad-gītā// is written by some man, unknown man." So I said, "What is the value of it then? Why are you quoting //Bhagavad-gītā?// Why are you learning it?" "It is knowledge, very nice knowledge." "So any knowledge imparted by any mundane man, what value does it have?"

**Prabhupāda:**
So why don't you accept it? What is the use of quoting?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Yes. That they will not do, because they know they can make money by quoting //Bhagavad-gītā.// People will not accept anybody if they openly say that they don't believe in //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That was going on. It is the first time. We are pressing: "You must take it seriously." It is the first time. Otherwise this was going on, at least for the last two hundred years.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
And then when we say about that a devotee goes to Vaikuṇṭha, this and that, "Oh, Vaikuṇṭha and all those things are just myth, just baloney."

**Prabhupāda:**
You are authority, you rascal. You are authority. Everything is myth; you are simply truth. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

**Harikeśa:**
Well, reality and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Where everything is myth, then why you are truth? You are also myth. Everything is myth, so you are also myth. So what is the use of talking nonsense?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
They believe in whatever is existing now. Whatever is existing now, or whatever they...

**Prabhupāda:**
And what is not existing which is mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā? Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam// [[books:bg:4:13|[Bg. 4.13]]]. Still people say, "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //kṣatriya,//" "I am this," "I am that." It is existing.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
They would even believe the mundane historians more than the //śāstras.// Like the historians have very funny stories. The Āryans came from the northeast Asia or something.

**Indian man (1):**
Central Asia.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Central Asia and inhabited in India. Then the Indian civilization sprang. Everybody thinks that India was not originally inhabited. It was all inhabited by the Dravidians, and then the Dravidians were pushed into the South and then Āryans dominated them. Whatever they learn in the schools. And because they have this theory, therefore they have to date all the //śāstras// after..., either after Christ or just a few centuries before Christ. [break] //...bhārata,// they say, it must have been a small family feud and some poet's imagination made it a big war.

**Prabhupāda:**
"May be; may not be." [laughter] We say "may not be."

**Brahmānanda:**
They say the //Mahābhārata// was written 1400 B.C., and that date correlates with dates of the Egyptian and Greek empire.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, so many dates have been quoted there. Now which is correct? That is our question. So many dates they have discussed. And which one is correct? Either everyone is correct or everyone is incorrect. This is the... There cannot be many dates; that is not possible. Date must be one. So which one is correct? Who will answer this?

**Brahmānanda:**
Everyone has a different opinion.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it.

**Devotee (2):**
Recently they had a big questioning in the [indistinct] newspapers what the outcome would be.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Devotee (2):**
And your Godbrother Swāmī Bon? He became...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I know that. He is also one of them.

**Devotee (2):**
He established... [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Others, they do not accept. So...

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Funny thing is that some of the historians, they say, "There was no war like //Mahābhārata.// It's all fictitious. There's nothing like Kurukṣetra." Some historians say that there is Kurukṣetra and there is evidences of war of //Mahābhārata.// But none of them completely agree with the scriptures. They all have their own fantastic theories, even those who say that...

**Prabhupāda:**
So why shall I accept them?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
How can we prove the infallibility...

**Prabhupāda:**
They cannot prove. Our proof is already there. They cannot prove. Why don't you take that point, that these rascals, they are contradictory to one another, so they cannot prove. Our proof is already there.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
That is what we should aim at. We should aim at "You cannot prove your..."

**Prabhupāda:**
You cannot prove. You are contradictory. So why shall I accept you or he? We accept our own proof. That's all. First of all you agree amongst yourselves; then question us. You cannot agree. Why shall I believe you? One says that "He is wrong," and the other says, "He is wrong." Now we say, "You are both wrong. We reject you." [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
But how can we impress the masses that we are right, the innocent people?

**Prabhupāda:**
They are not historians, rascals. They will believe //Mahābhārata.// They are not so-called historians, scientists. They still believe in the Vedic standard.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
People in general.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. They're actually doing that. They may believe or not believe; our belief is going on all over the world. Is it not?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all. //Phalena pariciyate.// [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. We don't make any compromise. What we believe, we are preaching that. People are accepting. So you believe or not believe; it doesn't matter for us. [break]

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
...just institutions, they also say "Indian mythology."

**Prabhupāda:**
They have been taught like that.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
And they put out books on //Mahābhārata// or Rāmacandra, "Indian mythology."

**Prabhupāda:**
But who cares for them?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Ninety-nine percent of the people are completely misled.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, not ninety-nine percent. Maybe nine percent. [break]

**Dr. Patel:**
As a matter of fact, science is not revealing itself now. Science is also realizing that it is not the way to realize God. I mean the... Science is, when you were a student at college, was much different than what it is today, sir, to tell the truth. The scientists have realized that they are nothing before..., before all that they observe and the director of all that action, themselves and everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

**Passerby:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Svarūpa Dāmodara is real scientist. He is admitting. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// What is that? //Yad uttama śloka-guṇanuvarṇanam.//

> idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā
> sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ
> avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito
> yad uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam
> [[books:sb:1:5:22|[SB 1.5.22]]]

//Puṁsa,// "of the human society"; //sviṣṭasya,// "education." //Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya, sviṣṭasya, ca buddhi-dattayoḥ.// Whatever big, big activities are there---education, charity, //tapasya...// Why these things are required? What is the meaning of becoming advanced in such things? //Avicyuto 'rthaḥ. Avicyuto 'rthaḥ:// "Without any doubt, the //artha,// the conclusion, is that they should describe the wonderful activities of the Supreme Person." Then it is perfect education. And these rascals, they are saying, "Now we don't require God."

**Dr. Patel:**
No, sir, but these great scientists like Huxley were all...

**Prabhupāda:**
No...

**Dr. Patel:**
They have realized the working of God in every atom, to tell the truth. It was so some fifty years back that the scientists did not believe in the existence and working of God, but they have much changed now.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means they were foolish; now they are coming to be wise.

**Dr. Patel:**
But they have died out, the previous generation. Now the new generation.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, still there are, so many rascals.

**Dr. Patel:**
There cannot be uniformity of...

**Prabhupāda:**
So many rascals. That one scientist came to talk with me in California. And he: "God? What is God? We have now solved everything." And you are rascal, demon.

**Dr. Patel:**
He should be asked to "Make a single living cell yourself. We'll give you all the ingredients, all the chemicals, and make us a living cell. If you can make it?" That should be the answer to that.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are so foolish. I very strongly talk with them. Still, stubborn, doggish. [chuckles] That scientist, I told him in his..., that "You are a demon." I told him, "You are a demon." So he tolerated. [laughs]

**Dr. Patel:**
They are serving the Mammon and not God.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, so many psychologists, psychiatrists, scientists, they come there in Los Angeles.

**Dr. Patel:**
I mean, the psychologists are the real science which can lead a man to the higher understanding of life, psychologists. The abstract sciences of biology and psychics, chemistry are little lower sciences. The psychology is much higher.

**Prabhupāda:**
No science is perfect. //Āsato dhāvato bahiḥ// [[books:sb:5:18:12|[SB 5.18.12]]].

**Dr. Patel:**
In imperfection also there may be gradations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gradations, that I give the example: stool, this side and that side, the dry side and the moist side. Somebody says, "Oh, this side is very good. It is dry stool." [laughter] Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
You have to examine in a different way.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, this is very good example. Stool is stool, but they are thinking, "This side is very good because it is dried up.

**Dr. Patel:**
We see a thing from any angle, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, this is also one of the angle.

**Dr. Patel:**
And we scientists have got different angle.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, there is no different angle. It is foolishness. Stool is stool, this side or... If you say, "This angle is very..." The same thing.

**Dr. Patel:**
The human stool is a stool for the human being. Does it not become a food for a stray dog?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is human stool.

**Dr. Patel:**
That you see. Does it not become the food for a stray dog, sir? That you see.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, therefore we say...

**Dr. Patel:**
When I was a small boy I was very much wondering how this filth that is cast away from human body can nourish the dog's body. But that is the bountifulness of God, sir.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Just like that...

**Dr. Patel:**
[to Yaśomatīnandana] Now don't talk. [laughter] I was a professor in the college, so I am very sorry. This particular habit is lurking me as yet.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
//Māyā// is killing the scientists.

**Dr. Patel:**
[Gujarati] But that is what it is, sir. Really, it set me thinking when I was a small baby boy, how this could maintain the body of a dog if there was no something in it. It is a very important thing to understand. Think about it.

**Prabhupāda:**
...good substance, very good substance. Stool is full of hypophosphates.

**Dr. Patel:**
Whatever it is, but there it is...

**Prabhupāda:**
That was analyzed by a big doctor. You know that Dr. Ghosh who came? Dr. Ghosh from Allahabad?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Last year he came, you were here.

**Prabhupāda:**
So one day I went to his house, and I saw in a plate something yellow is kept. And "What is this, doctor?" "Oh, that is stool to be examined." [laughs]

**Dr. Patel:**
The stool, so long it is in your body, it is you, a part of you, because we are all, majority of us are body conscious. There are very few people like you, who are soul conscious.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Māyāvāda philosophy.

**Dr. Patel:**
We are in the process of making soul consciousness.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, that is Māyāvāda philosophy.

**Dr. Patel:**
But still, every moment we are body conscious.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that's it. But that is Māyāvāda philosophy, "Everything one. Everything one."

**Dr. Patel:**
Māyāvāda or no //vāda,// this is a fact, that we are body conscious. We look to the facts, sir, we scientists.

**Brahmānanda:**
Ramakrishna ate stool because he said, "Stool and //prasādam// are one."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? He ate stool?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
Where does he say so?

**Brahmānanda:**
His disciple... One of his disciples told us.

**Dr. Patel:**
Disciple has said, but...

**Brahmānanda:**
As an experiment to show that it was all one, he said that he ate stool.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, of course, I do not know about stool, but he wanted to eat beef.

**Dr. Patel:**
Meat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Beef.

**Dr. Patel:**
Because he tried to worship God in the form of Muslims.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So he wanted permission from the proprietor of the temple: "Now I am going to experiment Muhammadan religion, so I want to eat beef." So he said frankly that "Now you have to go away, sir. I cannot allow this." Then he stopped.

**Dr. Patel:**
But he did not eat beef. He did not eat beef. He saw it and that's all.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, when the permission was not given by the proprietor he had no other way to stop.

**Dr. Patel:**
Rasamaṇi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rasamaṇi. Rasamaṇi's husband.

**Dr. Patel:**
She was a widow.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, husband, no. Yes. His son-in-law.

**Dr. Patel:**
The son-in-law, Mathura.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Ah, yes.

**Dr. Patel:**
But he experimented as a Christian, as a Muslim and all, and he said he came to the same truth.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is rascaldom. That is rascaldom. He experimented mean he was a fool. And a fool makes experiment, one who is fool. One who knows, why he should make experiment?

**Dr. Patel:**
Scientists do make experiments.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore they are fools. [laughter]

**Dr. Patel:**
You say so.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We don't make any experiment. We don't make any. We say, "Kṛṣṇa is God." That's all. No experiment.

**Dr. Patel:**
If, sir, Edison had not made experiment...

**Prabhupāda:**
Edison, Fedison, all these are rascals. All these... Edison...

**Dr. Patel:**
You would not have electricity today in the streets.

**Prabhupāda:**
We don't make any experiments.

**Dr. Patel:**
This is a matter of worshiping. He experimented with the method of worshiping.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, experiment means one who is making experiment, he is a fool.

**Dr. Patel:**
I mean the experiment of making..., method of worshiping, sir. You worship this way, other...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no method. Only method---//bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. That is method. All rascals. All rascals. Yes, all rascals.

**Dr. Patel:**
No, sir. The Christians, they go to the temple to worship God in the same way.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I don't say Christian and Hindus, Muslims. Anyone who is not a //bhakta,// he is a rascal. That's all. That is our conclusion. Therefore we say all rascals. //Mūḍha.// Kṛṣṇa says, //bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. Why should we experiment other than that?

**Dr. Patel:**
But that is the way of //bhakti,// sir. My contention is this, with all my...

**Prabhupāda:**
You cannot make.

**Dr. Patel:**
I submit myself meekly, that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Truth is truth. There is no experiment. Truth is truth. You cannot make experiment: "All right, let us see. The sun may rise this side." Can you do that?

**Dr. Patel:**
I think I am not explicit to you, sir. What I mean to say is way of worshiping...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no other way of worshiping except //bhakti.//

**Dr. Patel:**
No, but that is also a //bhakti,// sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, but... Only way. //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. God is one, and to understand God is one. That is it. Now...

**Dr. Patel:**
He has saints in the same God by all the ways. If I...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no other way. That is foolishness. That is explained. //Ye 'py anya-devatā bhaktā yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ, mām eva te 'pi bhajanty avidhi-pūrvakam// [[books:bg:9:23|[Bg. 9.23]]]. That is //avidhi.// That is not //vidhi.//

**Dr. Patel:**
They are //bhajanti,// aren't they? Still they are //bhajanti,// sir. They are not non-//bhajanti// like so-called //mūḍha// scientists and like Hoffer.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Bhajanti...// It is, I think, //yajanti,// not //bhajanti. Yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam.// That is not the way.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhajanty avidhi-pūrvakam. Bhajanty aviddhi-purvakam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yajanti.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhajanti,// sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Yajanti.//

**Dr. Patel:**
I think I am not wrong. //Bhajanty avidhi-pūrvakam.// They are...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, //ye 'py anya-devatāḥ...// That is another. //Śraddhayān... Te'pi mām eva...//

**Dr. Patel:**
I have still, I mean...

**Prabhupāda:**
I think //yajanti.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Bhajanti avidhi-pūrvakam. Parasmaipada,// not //atmānepada. Bhajanti avidhi-pūrvakam//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, it is //avidhi-pūrvakam.//

**Dr. Patel:**
//Avidhi-pūrvakam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not //vidhi.//

**Dr. Patel:**
"Those who worship //devas,// they go to //devas,// and those who worship Me, they come to Me."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Dr. Patel:**
//Devāṇī yanti deva-yaja bhūtāni yanti bhūtejya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
But these Ramakrishna men say...

**Dr. Patel:**
//Mām eva...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ramakrishna men say, "You worship any demigod, you go to God." Kṛṣṇa does not say. They say, "There are as many ways." And Kṛṣṇa says, //mām ekam.// They're all against //śāstra.// All against //śāstra.// [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

**Dr. Patel:**
Did you know this //bhūteṣu tiṣṭhantaṁ parameśvaram// [[books:bg:13:28|[Bg. 13.28]]]? //Na hināsty ātmāna ātmānam tathāpy ātmā...// How shall you explain that, sir? //Samaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu tiṣṭhantaṁ parameśvaram.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sarvaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu// [[books:bg:13:28|[Bg. 13.28]]], that I have explained so many times. If you see materially either dog or a big //brāhmaṇa,// the body is the same material.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Śuni caiva śva-pāke ca.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Body, when you dissect the body you find the same blood, same muscle, same bone. That's all. That is material. And spiritually they are //ātman.// Therefore //sama-darśinaḥ.// From that point of view, from basic point of view. Not that he is seeing a //brāhmaṇa// and dog equal. No. Not that. He is seeing the outward and inward. Inward is spirit. That is one. And outward, matter, that is one.

**Dr. Patel:**
Another is //śuni caiva śva-pāke ca paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is the same thing, because he does not see the form; he sees the ingredients. Just like there are so many earthen pots, dolls. So any sane man knows that these are all made of earth. That's all. That vision is wanted, but these rascals, they are thinking, "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am //kṣatriya,//" "I am fat," "I am this," "I am that." Therefore they are imperfect.

**Dr. Patel:**
Oh, we are prepared to think we are Americans, but they don't take us, unfortunately. [laughs]

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dr. Patel:**
You see? I may, little digressing from this point. You see, before the India became freed we had an extremely high opinion about American race, American people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Still I have got.

**Dr. Patel:**
Because... No, not people like us.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is correct. Still I have got.

**Dr. Patel:**
I have got also. Because then it was American president who supported the freedom movement of India. But unfortunately Dulles spoiled the speech.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I am not speaking from that point of view. I see that the Americans, they have helped me in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

**Dr. Patel:**
You, but the whole India they helped. It is not only you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I feel obliged to them. Nobody helped me. These boys helped me.

**Dr. Patel:**
It was your President Roosevelt, by whose action, I mean, Mr. Churchill began to lose his grip on India.

**Prabhupāda:**
And this American government even, they never put any hindrance in my movement. They have, rather, appreciated. And many American old gentlemen came to congratulate me.

**Dr. Patel:**
Because you are helping them, salvaging the boys from the [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever it may be, but they have helped me.

**Dr. Patel:**
They are not smoking that.

**Indian man (3):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, in 1962 in Geneva only they helped, America. [Hindi]

**Dr. Patel:**
Because that is a democracy. India...

**Prabhupāda:**
And another thing, from material point of view... I am touring all over the world so many times. Materially nobody is as opulent as America. Nobody. Not even...

**Dr. Patel:**
Because the best brains of the world are drained there. That is the real cause.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever it may be...

**Dr. Patel:**
Best brains of the world, they are attracted to America.

**Prabhupāda:**
Money, everyone is trying to get money in Bombay. But why there are [indistinct]? It is... Unless one is destined to get money, he cannot get. It is not that, so cheap thing, that I want money, money will come. It is //janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrībhir// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]]. Unless one is pious he cannot get money, he cannot get education.

**Dr. Patel:**
//Yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇo yatra pārtho dhanur-dharaḥ// [[books:bg:18:78|[Bg. 18.78]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So in that sense of materially, //janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī,// these four thing...

**Dr. Patel:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
So... [break] ...taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the greatest fortune. Thousands of young men joining, but here in India nobody is coming.

**Dr. Patel:**
Because they have already joined.

**Prabhupāda:**
All unfortunate, now they are. They have been so much trained badly. They say frankly, "Oh, this Hare Kṛṣṇa we have seen." In America when they chant... The Americans are chanting on the street, and the Indian students, "Oh, this we have done much. We have nothing to..." Here also they are thinking like that: "What is this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement? Eh? A beggars' movement." //Śāstra// says, //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]], and these rascals are thinking, "Oh, Hare Kṛṣṇa we have seen." You see? They have become so greatly intelligent, these rascals. They do not believe in //śāstra,// in //sādhu,// in God. All these "incarnations" and big, big men, they say, "Oh, what is the use of //śāstra?//" Even this Anandamaya says that "In higher advancement there is no need of //śāstra.//" He is above //śāstra.// He..., she says like that. And Kṛṣṇa said, //yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na sa siddhim avāpnoti// [[books:bg:16:23|[Bg. 16.23]]]. Immediately condemned: "If you don't believe in //śāstra,// you are rascal." Kṛṣṇa said. And they say, "Oh, there is no need of..." And he's an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. This Balayogi rascal is doing that: "There is no need of //śāstra.//" This is going on. Now he's finished, of course. His activity is finished. [end]
