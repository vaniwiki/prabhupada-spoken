====== Sannyāsa Initiation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sannyāsa// means that finishing all material desires. The //sannyāsa// means, real //sannyāsa,// means no more material desires. It is the beginning of spiritual life. //Etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhā.// Parātmā, Bhagavān... To completely devote one's life for service of the Lord. There are //āśramas,// four //āśramas: brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha// and //sannyāsa.// So //sannyāsa// means everything sacrificed for Kṛṣṇa's sake. //Anāśrita-karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī// [[books:bg:6:1|[Bg. 6.1]]]: anyone who is working without any aspiration for resultant action. Our //sannyāsīs,// they work very hard, preach, they collect money---but not a single farthing for himself. The first of all, the //brahmacārī// is trained up. //Brahmacārī guru-kule vasan dānto guror hitam// [[books:sb:7:12:1|[SB 7.12.1]]]. //Brahmacārī// is trained up to live at the place of //guru// for the benefit of //guru.// The same principle, when it is matured and when one dedicates his life for the benefit of Kṛṣṇa...

Benefit of Kṛṣṇa means benefit of the whole world. Kṛṣṇa wants //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. A //sannyāsī// should go door to door. //Mahad-vicalanaṁ nṛṇāṁ grhiṇāṁ dīna-cetasām// [[books:sb:10:8:4|[SB 10.8.4]]]. A //sannyāsī// is called //mahātmā.// Why he is //mahātmā?// Because his //ātmā// is now broader. //Gṛhiṇāṁ dīna-cetasām. Mahad-vicalanam. Mahātmā// travels or wanders country to country, door to door---//mahad-vicalanaṁ nṛṇāṁ gṛhiṇām//---especially for the householders, //dīna-cetasām,// whose consciousness or mind is very crippled. They are //dīna-cetasām.// All these materialistic person, they are simply interested how to enjoy senses; therefore they are called //dīna-cetasām,// cripple-minded. They have no other idea. So to enlighten them it is the duty of the //sannyāsī// to go from door to door, country to country, just to teach them about the aim of life. That is still going on in India. Still, if a //sannyāsī// goes in a village, people will come to invite him, try to hear from him.

So you are taking this pledge for serving in front of Kṛṣṇa, Vaiṣṇava, //guru// and fire. So you shall be very much cautious not to forget your duty. You have got good opportunity. You are going to Africa to deliver these persons. Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, //kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ, ye 'nye ca pāpā// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. These groups of men are considered very fallen, //kirāta,// the black men. They are called //niṣāda.// Niṣāda was born of Vena, King Vena. So they are habituated to steal; therefore they have been given a separate place, African jungles. That is there in the //Bhāgavatam.// So..., but everyone can be delivered. //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ ye 'nye ca pāpā.// These are known as sinful life. But Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, "There may be others which is not mentioned here." //Ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ:// "If they take shelter of a Vaiṣṇava," //śudhyanti,// "they become purified."

So you have to become very rigid Vaiṣṇava; then you will be able to deliver them. //Śudhyanti.// How they can be purified without taking another birth? Yes. //Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// Because Vaiṣṇava is going to deliver them, by the power of Viṣṇu they become empowered. So practically we have seen last time when I went to Nairobi, so many, these Africans, they are making progress very nicely. They are making nice questions. They are following rules and regulation. So African people, they are not so much sophisticated or so-called civilized to forget God. But if you work sincerely and if you can deliver one person only by your endeavor, then immediately you become recognized by Kṛṣṇa. //Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. This is the quickest way to become recognized by Kṛṣṇa, by preaching work.

So be seriously..., you take. This business is very nice, and there is good prospect. Prospect is there for everywhere. It is not that... //Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu said there are as many villages and as many towns on the surface of the globe. So His word is not a trifle thing. Yes. There is potency in all the parts of the world to become Vaiṣṇava.

> pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grama
> sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma
> [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]

So with Caitanya Mahāprabhu's blessing and spiritual strength, and with the good wishes of Vaiṣṇavas, just proceed and preach and always think of Kṛṣṇa. He will help. //Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. If you sincerely work... Kṛṣṇa is within yourself. He will give you strength, instruction. Simply you have to become... But we should always remember that //sannyāsa// means material activities finished. This is //sannyāsa:// no more material activities. Only for the service of Kṛṣṇa to live, that's all. [aside:] Give the //daṇḍa.// So this //daṇḍa,// there are four //daṇḍas. Daṇḍas// mean rods. One rod is body, one rod is mind, and one rod is speaking. //Kāya mana vākya.// And the fourth rod is the self. So you should always remember that taking this //daṇḍa// means that "My mind, my body and my words---everything is dedicated to Kṛṣṇa. It will be used only for Kṛṣṇa and for no other purpose." This is called //tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa.// Come on.
