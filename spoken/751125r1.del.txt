====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...this society. Only the important men, they can live as a //gṛhastha.// Not that "Now I am in love with this girl and get me married, and //yajña,// and then sleep." These things should be stopped. That, that what is his name, the rascal's name, that, whom you have driven away?

**Tejiyas:**
Śrīnati.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sringhadi?

**Tejiyas:**
Śrīnati.

**Prabhupāda:**
Śrīnati. From his face it appears that he's woman-hunter. Did he talk with you?

**Tejiyas:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So in every center they must rise early in the morning. They must follow the regulative principles. They must attend class. Otherwise let them go out. We don't want. And if anyone wants to marry, first of all he must show that he has some earning capacity. Not that "Because there are so many girls, and I marry one to satisfy my senses..." I thought that boy was nice, and I heard all these stories.

That is also another defect, that we have got young boys and young girls open for lovemaking. And //brahmacārī// means strictly prohibited to see the face of woman. But we cannot stop it. That is also another defect. Fire is good and butter is good, but when they come together everything become bad. Is it not? Fire is good, just like heat. And butter is good, healthy. But when they come together the butter melts and the fire extinguished. This is //māyā's// arrangement. Hmm?

//Puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etam// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This whole world is going on by the sex attraction, and when they come together, the both of them become spoiled. Therefore it has to be dealt with very, very carefully, so many rules, regulation. [break] ...used, Nitāi?

**Nitāi:**
Whenever there is necessity.

**Prabhupāda:**
Compulsory.

**Nitāi:**
Compulsory. When there's rule, //vidhi.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore it is said, //vrajet,// "must." //Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta// [SB 11.3.21]. At least let us inform the whole world that the process of civilization, education, everything rotten. That we have to say. [pause] [end]
