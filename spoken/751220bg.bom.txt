====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.1 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> śrī bhagavān uvāca
> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

The //yoga// system which is known as //bhakti-yoga...// [children making noise]

**Devotee:**
[indistinct] take the children outside.

**Girirāja:**
The children won't understand the lecture.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone is trying... Not everyone; at the present moment, practically nobody wants to understand what is God. Everyone is busy to fulfill the desires and necessities of the body.

> yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke
> sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijya-dhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

//Go-kharaḥ. Go// means cow and //kharaḥ// means ass. So according to Vedic culture, one who has accepted this material body as self... //Ātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke.// This body is a combination of matter, and the living force within this body is not this combination of matter; it is the spirit soul. That one has to understand before coming to the platform of spiritual life. So long one is attached with this material body it is not possible to understand what is spiritual life. If one continues to be attached to this material body, he is no better than //go-kharaḥ,// cows and asses, animals.

So our Vedic culture... Vedic culture means that human culture, not animal culture. Animal culture means to satisfy the needs of the body, and Vedic culture or human culture means to satisfy the needs of the soul. That is the beginning of //Bhagavad-gītā.// One who is reading //Bhagavad-gītā...// In India practically everyone reads, but because one does not take the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā// as it was instructed by Kṛṣṇa, he cannot take the benefit of //Bhagavad-gītā's// instruction. One tries to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// by erudite scholarship, or good position in the society---political, social, economical---but that is not the way to understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// The way to understand //Bhagavad-gītā// is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> updekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

Unless you approach a person who is representative of Kṛṣṇa and //tattva-darśī,// who has seen the truth, //jñānī,// and full of knowledge, from him you can understand what is //Bhagavad-gītā,// what is Bhagavān. Otherwise you cannot understand. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. If you remain covered by the material energy, then you cannot understand //Bhagavad-gītā.// The purpose of //Bhagavad-gītā// is to understand real religious life. Religion means the order which is given by God to carry out. That is religion. Those who are unknown of this fact, they are not religious. They may be some faith or blind belief, but religion means //dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇitam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. Religion means the order, or the law, given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is religion.

So to know God, the God, He is personally giving instruction how to know God. Kṛṣṇa says, //bhagavān uvāca.// Here it is not... Vyāsadeva is not speaking; Kṛṣṇa said. Because sometimes Kṛṣṇa is misunderstood; therefore Vyāsadeva writes or says in this connection, //bhagavān uvāca.// Bhagavān means the fully opulent, //samagrasya. Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]: He is the most powerful, the supreme rich, supreme wise, supreme beautiful and at the same time supremely renounced. These qualification makes one Bhagavān. So //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. That is the verdict of Vedic literature. So //īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. Bhagavān is also sometimes called Parameśvara. //Īśvara// means the ruling power or the personality who controls. So every one of us, we have got some controlling power either in the society or family or community or government or international. Everyone has got some capacity to control, but nobody is supreme controller. Supreme controller means that He is no more controlled by anyone. Other controller, they are controllers, but they are controlled by somebody else. But Kṛṣṇa is not that kind of controller. He is the supreme controller means He controls everyone but nobody has above Him to control. Therefore He is called Parameśvara. //Īśvaraḥ// means controller.

//Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. He is not //nirākāra; vigraha. Vigraha// means form, but His form is different from our form. Therefore He is described as //sac-cid-ānanda. Sat// means eternal, //cit// means full of knowledge, and //ānanda// means full of transcendental bliss, eternal bliss. The beginning is eternal, so eternal life, eternal complete, full knowledge and eternal bliss; this is the composition of Kṛṣṇa's body. But //mūḍhas,// rascals, they think Kṛṣṇa as ordinary human being. //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. Fools and rascals, //mūḍhāḥ---mūḍhāḥ// means fools and rascals---because they see that Kṛṣṇa is incarnation just like ordinary human being, cousin of Arjuna or nephew of Kuntī, like that. //Paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa comes just like ordinary human being, but that does not mean He is ordinary human being. Therefore Vyāsadeva says //bhagavān uvāca.// If you consider Kṛṣṇa as ordinary human being, then you are missing the point.

And I have already given the definition of Bhagavān. One of the qualification of Bhagavān is //aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. //Jñāna.// He has got full knowledge. He hasn't got to take knowledge from anyone else. //Svābhāvikī jñāna.// Bhagavān means //svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca. Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇam...,// this is Vedic injunction.

> na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate
> na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate
> parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate
> svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca
> [[books:cc:madhya:13:65|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]

//Svābhāvikī,// all full knowledge He has got. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]: He is the creator of everything. So how He got this knowledge to float these big, big planets in the air? That... There is knowledge. There is art. Just like when you float a big aeroplane in the sky, it requires knowledge, it requires technology, art. It is not flying automatically; that is a mistake. So if to float an ordinary airship it requires so much knowledge, so much technology, how much knowledge is there when you see that the biggest planet, the sun, is floating in the air, and it is lying in one corner of the sky and exactly in time it is rotating, //yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ?// There is knowledge; there is art, who has fixed it. Therefore in the //Vedas// it is said, //yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ// [Bs. 5.52]. He is also rotating in the orbit by the order of Govinda. //Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.//

So there are so many things to learn and to understand what is God and what is Kṛṣṇa. God means Kṛṣṇa. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. //Na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]. God means nobody is equal to Him and nobody is greater than Him. That is God. There is no competition that in this quarter there is one God and another neighborhood there is another God, just like it has become a fashion, so many Gods, competition is going on. No. There is no competition. God is one. //Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate, na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate.// That is God. So because God is complete in knowledge, therefore we have to take knowledge from Him, not from the persons who has got incomplete knowledge. That knowledge is not perfect. We must take knowledge from the person..., we have to take knowledge from the person:

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

We have to approach. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. We have to approach a superior person, //guru,// and take knowledge from him. The most superior person is Kṛṣṇa. You may doubt others, that may be, but when you come to Kṛṣṇa, that is perfect knowledge. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1].

So Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He comes in, once in... We were calculating yesterday, what is, how many years after? You were there? Ah, some billions of years after. We can calculate from the //śāstra// because He comes once in the day of Brahmā. The Brahmā's duration of life is there in the //Bhagavad-gītā, sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ// [[books:bg:8:17|[Bg. 8.17]]]. Forty-three //lakhs// of years multiplied by thousand becomes twelve hours of Brahmā, and similarly twelve hours at night, that is one day and night. Such thirty times makes a month, such twelve times makes a year, and similarly hundred years is the duration of life of Brahmā. So according to //śāstra// we understand once in the day of Brahmā Kṛṣṇa appears.

Why does He appear? //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati..., tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. //Dharmasya glāniḥ.// What is that //dharmasya glāniḥ?// Disobedience to Kṛṣṇa's order. That is //dharmasya glāniḥ. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya. Dharma// is one. As God is one, similarly //dharma// is also one. There cannot be many //dharmas.// There are many //dharmas// practically we see: Hindu //dharma,// Muslim //dharma,// Christian //dharma,// Buddha //dharma,// this //dharma,// so many //dharma.// But real //dharma// is one. That is explained in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ. Para// means transcendental. These are material //dharma:// "I am Hindu," "You are Muslim," "You are Christian," "You are this," "You are that." These are..., means an attempt to raise oneself to the platform of real //dharma.// But real //dharma// is one for everyone. What is that? //Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ.// That is transcendental //dharma. Yato bhaktir adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:2:6|[SB 1.2.6]]]. The //dharma// by following which one becomes a Kṛṣṇa conscious person or godly person, one who understands God, his relationship with Him and acting according to that relation, that is real //dharma.// So our, everyone's, all living entities' //dharma// means to know that we are eternal servant of God. That is explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. And in the //Bhagavad-gītā// also Kṛṣṇa instructs the same //dharma,// that "You are, the living entities, you are all My part and parcel, and it is your duty to cooperate with Me without any reservation." That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].

So the //Bhagavad-gītā// was spoken by Kṛṣṇa personally when He was present for the benefit of the human society, for all nations. It is not for the Hindus or the Indians; it is for everyone. God is for everyone. Kṛṣṇa also says, //sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ, ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]], every living entity is part and parcel, and He is the supreme father of everyone. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to re-establish the real //dharma,// not fictitious //dharma.// That is //bhāgavata-dharma.// In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// also the same thing is spoken where Kṛṣṇa ends //Bhagavad-gītā: sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.// From the same point Vyāsadeva begins //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]], and he describes about //dharma: dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. All cheating type of religious system are //projjhita. Projjhita// means to throw away, kick out.

So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is //bhāgavata-dharma:// to teach throughout the whole world that God is great and we are small particle, part and parcel of God, our duty is to serve God. That is //bhakti. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]], when you favorably serve Kṛṣṇa, be ready to get orders from Kṛṣṇa and serve Him, that is perfection of life. That is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.// And if we daily manufacture a kind of //dharma// according to my concoction or we accept everything as real //dharma,// that is a mistake. //Dharma// means the order given by God, and if you follow that, or execute that order as Arjuna did, then you are //dharmika,// you are religious. Just like Arjuna, he followed Kṛṣṇa's order. Kṛṣṇa wanted him to fight. Of course, he was a //kṣatriya,// his duty was to fight, and Kṛṣṇa wanted him to fight. But he was hesitating because the other party with whom he had to fight, they happened to be his family member, most dear kith and kin, some of them are nephews, some of them //gurus,// teacher, grandfather. So all of them---it was a family fight---so Arjuna was not willing to fight, but Kṛṣṇa wanted to fight. And after learning from Him the essence of //Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]], he agreed to fight. That is //bhakti-yoga.// Even by fighting, you can become a devotee. You have to carry out the order of Kṛṣṇa. That is //bhakti-yoga.//

So you must be qualified to know Kṛṣṇa, then you must be qualified, or automatically you become qualified how to receive His order. This is the way. So unless you understand from where the order is coming, how the order-giver is speaking, if you do not know the science, how you can talk with Kṛṣṇa and receive His order? That is also not very difficult. Kṛṣṇa says, //teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam// [[books:bg:10:10|[Bg. 10.10]]]. Anyone who is twenty-four hours engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, //satata-yuktānām,// not sporadic, that two minutes I meditate upon Kṛṣṇa and then twenty-three hours sixty-eight minutes, ah, fifty-eight minutes, I remain to satisfy my senses. That is not //kṛṣṇa-bhakti. Kṛṣṇa-bhakti// means //satata-yuktānām,// twenty-four hours engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like these boys are being trained up. They have not come to me for some monetary benefit. What monetary benefit I can give to them? They are, rather, bringing money, and I am constructing big, big temples---their money. So still they are engaged in carrying out my order. There is no payment, no monetary benefit, because they have understood me, that "He is representative of Kṛṣṇa."

That we have to find out, the representative of Kṛṣṇa. That is also not very difficult, who is representative of Kṛṣṇa. Representative of Kṛṣṇa is he who simply repeats the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, does not say anything nonsense. He is representative of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. He does not say any big, big, bombastic thing. Very simple thing, that "Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer obeisances." It doesn't require M.A., Ph.D. education to learn these four things. Anyone, even a child, can do it. It is very easy. If you daily see the Deity in the temple, or if you have got Deity at home, even a child will be practiced to think of Kṛṣṇa. It is not at all difficult. And if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, that is also thinking of Kṛṣṇa.

So //man-manāḥ,// and if you continue this, then //mad-bhakta,// you become His devotee. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ. Mad-yājī,// then if you can, you can offer to Kṛṣṇa. Is it very expensive? No. //Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. You can offer Kṛṣṇa a little water or a //tulasī// leaf. Or if //tulasī// leaf is not available, any leaf. He does not say //tulasī// leaf. So what is the difficulty to secure a little water, a leaf or a small flower? //Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam.// The real thing is //bhakti. Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam.// So, //mad-bhakta,// if you are poorest of the poor you can become a devotee. //Ahaituky apratihatā yenātmā samprasīdati.// If you want to become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, there is no impediment throughout the three worlds within the universe. You can become a devotee, it is so easy. If you want to be a rich man it requires so much trouble. Rather, so long you do not desire to become a rich man, you are peaceful. And as soon as you desire to become a rich man, it will be all activities begin: how to acquire money this way or that way, this way... So, everyone tries to become rich man because generally one thinks that at old age I'll get some income and I shall sit down very peacefully. So you are already sitting down peacefully. Why you take another means?

Of course, these things we are not going to discuss, but //bhakti// means no desire. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. Then //bhakti// is very easy. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. People are very busy for knowledge and fruitive activities. Everyone in Bombay is working so hard day and night to get some result, and the //jñānīs,// when they are disgusted, they try to become //jñānī. Jñānī// generally means one who wants liberation, //mukti,// by merging into the existence. //Bhakti// is above this, //jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. If you want to become a //bhakta// then you have to disregard the process of fruitive activities and the speculative method of understanding God, //jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam.// Then what I have to do? //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā.// Simply you have to be ready to execute the order of Kṛṣṇa, Bhagavān. //Ānukūlyena,// what Kṛṣṇa says, you have to do that, just like a servant. Servant faithfulness is, as soon as the master orders something, he is ready. You have to become like that.

So to become ready to serve Kṛṣṇa does not require much knowledge or very advanced in fruitive activities. These are material things. Spiritually, when you understand that you are eternal servant of God, Kṛṣṇa, and if you become fully convinced and do the needful, then you are liberated immediately. //Mukti// means, it is described in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, muktir hitvānyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. If you understand that you are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, that is //mukti.// And so long you are thinking that you are master of something, that is bondage. This is the difference between //mukti// and bondage. Bondage means to think of becoming master. "I am the lord of this universe," or "I am trying to become a lord or master," this is bondage. And when you fully understand Kṛṣṇa and become engaged in His service, that is //mukti.//

So for a devotee, there is no question of //mukti.// A devotee is already //mukta.// Why? Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "Immediately, as soon as you surrender to Me, immediately I give you protection." You are awaiting some fruitive result of your past //karma,// that is bondage. You have to take birth and you have to serve according to that //karma.// Then from that position you are immediately liberated. //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi...// Then you are //mukta.// So if you remain in the position to serve Kṛṣṇa, then you are always //mukta. Muktiḥ mukulitāñjali sevate asmān.// A great devotee, Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura, he said this //muktiḥ mukulitāñjali,// "With folded hands she is standing at my door, 'What can I do for you?' " Maidservant. So devotee is not after //mukti,// because they are already //muktas. Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. He is already //nirmala,// without a tinge of material motive. Therefore he is able to serve Kṛṣṇa. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]].

So Kṛṣṇa personally instructing //Bhagavad-gītā// to understand Him, so we should take advantage of this, otherwise we are missing this opportunity this human form of life. Kṛṣṇa is not teaching //Bhagavad-gītā// to some cats and dogs. He is teaching to the most influential person, //imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. So //Bhagavad-gītā// is meant for the //rājarṣi,// very rich, opulent, at the same time saintly person. Formerly all the kings were //rājarṣi//---//rāja// and //ṛṣi// combined together. So the //Bhagavad-gītā// is not meant for the loafer class. It is to be understood by the heads of the society: //yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ// [[books:bg:3:21|[Bg. 3.21]]]. So those who are claiming to be the leaders of the society, they must learn //Bhagavad-gītā,// how to become practical and actual leader, then the society will be benefited. And if we follow the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā// and Kṛṣṇa, then all problems will be solved. It is not a sectarian religious sentiment or fanaticism. It is not that. It is a science---social science, political science, cultural science. Everything is there.

So our request is that every one of you become a //guru.// That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order. He wants that everyone must become a //guru.// How? That He says:

> yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

This is //guru.// Suppose you are family member. So many living entities, your sons, your daughters, your daughter-in-law or children, you can become their //guru.// Exactly like this you can sit down in the evening and talk about the //Bhagavad-gītā, yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. You haven't got to manufacture something. The instruction is there; you simply repeat and let them hear---you become //guru.// It is not difficult at all. So that is our preaching. We do not want to become alone //guru,// but we want to preach in such a way that every..., the chief man, or any man, he can become //guru// in his surrounding. Anyone can do that. Even a coolie, he can also. He has got family, he has got friends, so even though he is illiterate, he can hear the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, and he can preach the same. This we want. And we invite all respectable gentlemen, leaders, to learn this. It is very simple: //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], and by executing this order of Kṛṣṇa, He assures, //mām evaiṣyasi,// "You come to Me." //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. Very easy thing.

So our only request is the leaders of the society should take up the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā// very seriously, learn himself and teach to others. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is not at all difficult; it is very easy. Everyone can do it. But the result will be that as soon as you understand..., people understand Kṛṣṇa, //janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]], anyone who understands Kṛṣṇa, the result is //tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti...// After giving up this body he does not accept any more material body; he stays in his spiritual identity and enjoys the society of Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana. //Gopījana-vallabha.// Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa, Vṛndāvana means that Kṛṣṇa is the center. He is the lovable object of everyone. The //gopīs,// the cowherd boys, the calfs, the cows, the trees, the fruits, flowers, the father, mother---everyone is attached to Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana. So this is the replica, this Vṛndāvana, and there is real Vṛndāvana. This is also real. In the absolute there is no difference. But for our understanding there is original Vṛndāvana,

> cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-
> lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam
> lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.29]

> veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ
> barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam
> kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ
> govindam...
> [Bs. 5.30]

This is the description, Goloka Vṛndāvana.

So there is //dhāma, panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara,// beyond this material world. So if we like, we can go there. //Mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām,// Kṛṣṇa says. You can go to the higher planetary system,

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtejyā yānti bhūtāni

If you are preparing to go to some other, better planet, that is the chance in the human being. But if you live like cats and dog, then where is promotion, where is Kṛṣṇa, and where is Goloka? Everything is spoiled. Our only request is don't spoil your time, valuable time. Be prepared for being transferred to Kṛṣṇa. And the method is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Take to it and be benefited.

Thank you very much.
