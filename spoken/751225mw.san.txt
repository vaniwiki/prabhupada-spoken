Two years ago.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is keeping Jagannātha within his beadbag and chanting.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Just before I came to India, Mukunda met him for about two hours. He said he was very friendly, and he would arrange a ninety-nine-year lease for us and give us the right to the [indistinct].

No, he's always good boy. What is the time now?

**Hari-śauri:**
