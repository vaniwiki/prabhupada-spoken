====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
How degraded they have become. There is no food, and they are busy for growing tobacco.

**Hari-śauri:**
You say that's what they call a cash crop.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Hari-śauri:**
The other day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now eat cash. So cash is also paper. So what is the use of laboring so hard? You eat paper. Paper is available.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
It is prohibited to buy gold at that temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
You cannot buy gold. Government has prohibited.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because you are rascal, your government is rascal. Democracy. What is the government? Government means your replica. So why do you blame the government? You are fools, rascals; you send other fools and rascals and suffer consequence. Tea, growing tobacco, growing jute, and no grains. And grain for the animal, so that animal, as soon as it becomes fatty, send it to the slaughterhouse, and then finish business. Smoke, eat meat, drink and be happy. So much land, but it is producing tobacco, which we are prohibiting, "No smoking." [break] Vegetable is utilized. [Hindi conversation] These crops. [Hindi] [break] //...nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]

**Indian man:**
//Prabhā// means effulgence.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Indian man:**
[Hindi] effulgence.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Prabhā. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi// [Bs. 5.40].

**Indian man:**
What is meant, "halo" and "effulgence"? That word meaning, "halo"? //Prabhā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Halo is //kṣatta//[?]. Practically the same meaning. [break] Just like field is green and this field is not green. If you take care, every field will be green.

[break] //...prasādam// to the audience.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Sumptuous.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
Full plate.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then accept program. [break] ...distribution of //prasāda,// then we can go everywhere, whole day program. //Kīrtana// and distribution. So that is going on. And simply dry philosophy, what people will understand?

**Yaśomatīnandana:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] //ḍāl, roṭī, chal?, sabjī// [Hindi]. [end]
