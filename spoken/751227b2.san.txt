====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.7 [with Translator] ======

[translated throughout]

**Prabhupāda:**
So //śrī-bhagavān uvāca// means the supreme authority. //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. If you learn from the supreme authority without any deficiency, then the knowledge is perfect. Ordinary person, they have got four deficiencies: they commit mistake, they are illusioned, their senses are imperfect, and with imperfect knowledge they try to speak---that is cheating. Therefore we have to receive knowledge from the person who knows past, present and future. So the best personality---there are so many others---Kṛṣṇa and His representative. Both of them are perfect because Kṛṣṇa is perfect, there is no doubt, and one who speaks according to Kṛṣṇa, he is also perfect. A human being or a living being is not expected to become as perfect as Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Therefore, if a person sticks to the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, does not make any addition and alteration, he is also perfect.

Unfortunately, at the present moment especially... It was done formerly also five thousand years, that they make addition and alteration on the version of Kṛṣṇa. Just like //Bhagavad-gītā// is misinterpreted by so-called scholars and politicians. Just like in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ// [[books:bg:1:1|[Bg. 1.1]]]. Somebody interprets, "This //dharma-kṣetra// is this body." Why? Why one should interpret in that way? Interpretation is required when things are not very clear. //Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre// is still there. People go to Kurukṣetra for executing religious rituals. And in the //Vedas// it is stated, //kuru-kṣetre dharmam ācaret.// So why it should be interpreted as "body"? And where is the dictionary where //dharma-kṣetra// means "body"? So in this way, if we interpret //Bhagavad-gītā,// then we spoil the whole thing. I spoil myself and spoil others. Therefore the conclusion is we shall accept //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, as it is spoken by Kṛṣṇa.

So here the //bhagavān uvāca,// the Supreme Personality of Godhead is speaking. So we shall take it without any interpretation. The Bhagavān says, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ.//

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

So Bhagavān says, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme authority, says that "You require to transfer your //āsakti,// attachment, to Me." Everyone has got //āsakti. Āśakti// means attachment, this material attachment. Someone has got attachment for his family, some to society, some to nation, some in business and so many things. //Āśakti// is there. But to make your life perfect, you have to transfer the //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. In the Western countries, I have seen, most of them, they have got no family, no //āsakti// family, but because the //āsakti// is there, every one of them keeps a dog. So they are accustomed to place their //āsakti// to cats and dogs. That means //āsakti// cannot be finished. That is not possible.

So you haven't got to learn what is //āsakti. Āśakti// is there. Everyone has got experience. Simply that //āsakti,// that tendency of attachment, should be transferred to Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana life. In Vṛndāvana the center of //āsakti// is Kṛṣṇa. There is Nanda Mahārāja, Yaśodā---they have //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. The young girls, they have got //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. The cowherd boys, they have got //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. The trees, they have got //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. The fruits, flowers, they have got //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. The water, Yamunā River, the //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. So if we make our central point of //āsakti,// then you can create Vṛndāvana everywhere. So this is the success of life. We have to change the //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. That is the highest form of mystic //yoga.// Kṛṣṇa has already explained in the previous verse,

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gata antarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo [mataḥ]
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

//Aneka yogīs...// There are many //yogīs,// many form of //yoga// practice, mystic, but the //yogī// who is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, he is first-class //yogī.//

So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to educate people how to become attached to Kṛṣṇa. But if one does not know what is Kṛṣṇa, there is no question of increasing his //āsakti// for Kṛṣṇa. So to understand Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa personally appears to draw our attention to Kṛṣṇa. When we forget our //āsakti,// that is material life. Forget our //āsakti// for Kṛṣṇa, that is our material life, or we struggle for existence in the material life. That is said by Kṛṣṇa: //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. This //dharmasya glāni,// deviation from the occupational duty... //Dharma// means occupational duty. Then Kṛṣṇa, out of His causeless mercy, He appears to teach us how to divert your attention and //āsakti// to Kṛṣṇa. So //dharmasya glāni,// deviation in the path of religious system, means to forget our eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa ultimately, at the end of the //Bhagavad-gītā,// He says, as the Supreme Person, He orders, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Therefore He did not come to establish the so-called Hindu //dharma// or Mussulman //dharma// or Christian //dharma,// this //dharma// or that. He came to establish the real //dharma,// that is, to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.

So //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is establishing also in the beginning, //dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra// [[books:sb:1:1:2|[SB 1.1.2]]]. In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// the so-called cheating ways and cheating type of //dharmas// are kicked out, //projjhita,// thrown away. //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is explaining what is real //dharma// as it is established by Kṛṣṇa, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. According to //dharma-śāstra,// material //dharma-śāstra,// it is said, //dharma artha kāma mokṣa// ([[books:sb:4:8:41|SB 4.8.41]], [[books:cc:adi:1:90|Cc. Ādi 1.90]]), up to //mokṣa.// In this connection Śrīdhara Swami, the great commentator of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// he says, //atra mokṣa-vāñchā api nirasta:// "In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there is no chance or opportunity for thinking of so-called liberation." The purpose is that if one fully surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, he immediately becomes liberated. The Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura, he says, //muktiḥ mukulitāñjali sevate asmān.// Why... For a devotee, why he should be anxious for //mukti,// because //mukti// is always standing on his door to give him service, //mukulitāñjali-sevā,// with folded hands. So a devotee hasn't got to endeavor separately for //mukti.// As soon as he is engaged in devotional service, //mukti// is already there. Just like if a person becomes rich man, automatically his poverty is gone away. So a rich man does not require to endeavor separately to drive away poverty. So therefore the central point is, Kṛṣṇa is advising here, "Just increase your //āsakti,// attachment, for Me. Then everything will come."

So He recommends, //mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// This word //mad-āśrayaḥ// is very important, because you cannot increase your attachment for Kṛṣṇa without being //mad-āśrayaḥ. Mad-āśrayaḥ// means to be directly under the direction of Kṛṣṇa or to be directly under the direction of somebody who has taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore He recommends //mad-āśrayaḥ.// You cannot execute the //yoga// system, devotional service, //bhakti-yoga,// without being under the control of somebody who is under the control of Kṛṣṇa. Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī has recommended therefore, //yad upāśrayāśrayā.// One has to take shelter of a pure devotee; then he becomes purified. //Yad upāśraya... Upāśraya// means to take shelter of a pure devotee. And in that case,

> kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā
> ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ
> ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ
> śudhyanti prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ
> [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]

So not only those who are highly elevated //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra... Śūdras...// Less than //śūdra,// they are called //kirāta, hūṇa, āndhra, pulinda, pulkaśā, ābhīra, yavanāḥ, khasādayaḥ.// They also can be purified if they take shelter of a pure devotee. Kṛṣṇa also says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, māṁ ca...,//

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striya vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]

Means that "Anyone, even if he is born in the //pāpa-yoni,// the //pāpa-yoni, kirāta, hūṇa,// if he takes shelter of Me, then he also gets the supreme perfection," //te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.// Now it is the duty of a devotee of Kṛṣṇa to expand this progressive march toward devotional service. Otherwise, how the //pāpa-yoni// will learn? This is //para upakāra.// This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

That every Indian who has taken birth in India as a human being, he should first of all make his life successful by understanding Kṛṣṇa, and then he must preach outside to render service to others as welfare activities.

So Kṛṣṇa appeared as Caitanya Mahāprabhu to teach us practically how to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness and how to deliver persons from the //pāpa-yoni.// Śrī Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, a //ācārya// of the Gauḍīya //sampradāya,// he says in his song, //śrī-nanda-nandana yei..., nanda-suta haila yei, śacī-suta haila sei.// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He appeared as the son of Mother Śacī. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings, "The same Personality of Godhead who appeared as the son of Mahārāja Nanda," //nanda-suta haila yei, śacī-suta haila sei,// "He has now appeared as the son of Mother Śacī." And //balarāma haila nitāi:// "And the same Balarāma has appeared as Nityānanda //prabhu.//" Now, what is Their business? That is described: //pāpī tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo.// So //pāpī tāpī yata chilo, harinām..., ta'ra sākṣī jagāi// and //mādhāi.// Then he is giving evidence how the //pāpī// and //tāpīs// are delivered. "Here is the example of Jagāi-Mādhāi." This Jagāi-Mādhāi, they took birth in a good //brāhmaṇa// family, but by bad association they became drunkard, thief, woman-hunter and so on, so on. But they were also delivered by Caitanya Mahāprabhu to become first-class Vaiṣṇava.

So our aim should be how to increase our attachment. The attachment is there. It is not artificial. It is said in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// that,

> nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti sādhya kabhu naya
> śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:107|[Cc. Madhya 22.107]]]

The Kṛṣṇa //bhakti,// attachment for Kṛṣṇa, is quite natural. It is already there. Simply it has to be awakened.

> nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti sādhya kabhu naya
> śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya

If you engage yourself to hear about Kṛṣṇa, then your heart will be purified and your original Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be awakened. For this purpose Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu also advises, //paraṁ vijāyate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam:// "All glories to the //saṅkīrtana// movement," because simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// everything will automatically come in. The complete instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu is,

> ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ
> śreyaḥ-kairava-candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam
> ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtāsvādanaṁ
> paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam
> [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]

So the //saṅkīrtana// movement, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, the more you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// your, the heart disease, material enjoyment, that will decrease, and then you will understand what is your position and you will be gradually attracted by Kṛṣṇa. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. This is the test of //bhakti,// that if you engage yourself twenty-four hours in devotional service, then immediately you become liberated. //Bhaktiḥ pareśā...// Liberation means to become detestful to material enjoyment.

So Kṛṣṇa attachment is so nice that... Dhruva Mahārāja, he was in the beginning attracted by material enjoyment. He wanted a kingdom more than his father, and he went to the forest for meeting the Supreme Personality of Godhead to get this benediction. So Dhruva Mahārāja actually when he saw the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he refused to accept any benediction. //Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce// [[books:cc:madhya:22:42|[Cc. Madhya 22.42]]]. This is the benefit of Kṛṣṇa //āsakti.// If you actually become attached to Kṛṣṇa, then you'll think yourself completely filled up. There is no more asking for any material benefit. Therefore in the //śāstra// it is recommended,

> akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā
> mokṣa-kāma udāra-dhīḥ
> tīvreṇa bhakti-yogena
> yajeta paramaṁ puruṣa
> [[books:sb:2:3:10|[SB 2.3.10]]]

Even if you have got material desires, //sarva-kāma,// still you be attached to Kṛṣṇa so your material aspiration will be fulfilled; at the same time, you'll get Kṛṣṇa. When Dhruva Mahārāja refused to take any benediction, Lord Viṣṇu informed him that "Don't bother. You had some desire for material fulfillment, so there is Dhruvaloka. You enjoy, and after your life is finished, you'll come to Vaikuṇṭha."

So Kṛṣṇa is so nice, so liberal, that if you have got a little tinge of aspiration He will fulfill you, and at the same time, you'll go back to home, back to Godhead. Therefore it is recommended, //yajeta paramaṁ puruṣa.// If you have got some material desire, still you worship Kṛṣṇa. He'll fulfill; at the same time, you will be able to go back to home, back to Godhead. Kṛṣṇa is all-powerful, almighty, with full with six opulences. So if you have got any material desire, that also Kṛṣṇa can fulfill. But you stick to Kṛṣṇa so that your //āsakti// will be increased. If you divert your attention to other demigods, then this //āsakti// will fail. Therefore for a devotee who sticks his faith in Kṛṣṇa, he has no chance for worshiping other demigods. The Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, //anya devāśraya nāi, tomāre kahinu bhāi, ei parama bhakti karaṇa.// For a devotee of Kṛṣṇa there is no scope for worshiping other deity, because that will not help him to increase his attachment for Kṛṣṇa. But if we want our //āsakti,// attachment, to increase for Kṛṣṇa, then absolute...

> anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ
> jñāna-karmādy anāvṛtam
> ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-
> śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā
> [Brs. 1.1.11]

We have to give up all other material desires, simply stick to Kṛṣṇa to serve Him, always ready to serve Him. //Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. Just like Arjuna. He was ready to serve Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, everyone should be ready to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is the perfection of life.

So one has to execute this process of devotional service, as Kṛṣṇa said, //mad-āśraya:// "Take shelter of Me or My devotee." Now, at the present moment, in the teachings of //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa is personally instructing, so let us take shelter of His personal instruction and make our life successful. And not only he becomes a devotee, but a pure devotee understands Kṛṣṇa as it is said here, //asaṁśayaṁ samagram,// not partially but fully. It is, of course, not possible to understand Kṛṣṇa fully. Still, almost fully a devotee can understand Kṛṣṇa. That is also confirmed in the last paragraph, last chapter,

> bhaktyā mām abhijānāti
> yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ
> tato māṁ tattvato jñātvā
> viśate tad-anantaram
> [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]

So if we want to go back to home, back to Godhead, then we must increase our attachment for Kṛṣṇa, and by that process we can understand Kṛṣṇa, what He is. //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. Then our door to go back to home, back to Godhead, is clear. The conclusion is, therefore, that we should take to the //bhakti// process as it is enunciated in authoritative //śāstra,// by Kṛṣṇa, by the //ācāryas. Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. That is the way, only, for our perfection of life.

Thank you very much. [end]
