====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.15 ======

**Prabhupāda:**

> kecit kevalayā bhaktyā
> vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ
> aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena
> nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ
> [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]

We are discussing this verse, that "Somebody," //kecit,// "not all." //Kecit,// "Somebody, simply by acting devotional service, devotional service to Vāsudeva, he immediately finishes all reaction of sinful life." Simply by devotional service unto the Vāsudeva, one can become free from all sinful reaction of life. //Bhaktyā// means "by devotional service." So //bhaktyā,// there are nine different processes. [break] [devotee translates thoughout] ...and the same, but according to our capacity they are divided into nine processes. So it begins with //śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma...// [[books:sb:7:5:23-24|[SB 7.5.23]]]. Beginning with //śravaṇam,// hearing. [break] ...nine processes are hearing, chanting, then worshiping, serving, offering everything. In this way there are nine different ways. The beginning is hearing. Hearing, just you all ladies, gentlemen, you have come here to hear. Then hearing, if your hearing is perfect, then //kīrtanam,// means describing or preaching.

So our this movement, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we are first giving chance to the people in general for hearing. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was talking with Rāmānanda Rāya, he specially gave stress on this point of hearing. If you hear, then the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is never conquered by anyone, but a devotee who is hearing about Him, he can conquer over Him. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, of course, He quoted from //Bhāgavatam.// Any devotee or bona fide preacher, he does not manufacture anything. He simply follows the previous //mahājana.// He said, //jñāne prayāsam udapāsya// [SB 10.14.3]. One should not try to speculate to understand the Supreme Truth. So we should give up this habit of speculating to understand God. One should become submissive, //jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva,// that very submissive to hear from the right person. So hearing is so important; therefore our all Vedic literature is called //śruti.// So the subject matter which is beyond our sense perception, //avāṅ-manasā gocaraḥ,// that cannot be understood by using our imperfect senses. Now the question is: from whom to hear? So in the //śāstra// it is said, //san-mukharitām:// "You have to hear from realized saintly person." It is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

You have to hear from a person who has seen or who has understood the Absolute Truth and who is //tat, sad-guru.// He must be a devotee of the Lord.

So it is stated in the //śāstra// that,

> ṣaṭ-karma-nipuṇo vipro
> mantra-tantra-viśāradaḥ
> avaiṣṇava gurur na sa syāt
> sat śva-paco guruḥ
> [Padma Purāṇa]

It is said that "A //brāhmaṇa// who is very well expert in the brahminical activities and //mantra-tantra-viśārada,// knows all the Vedic //mantras,// but if he is not a Vaiṣṇava, he cannot become //guru.// But a person born in a family of dog-eaters, //śva-paca,// he can become //guru// if he has become Vaiṣṇava." Sanātana Gosvāmī, one of the big //ācāryas// of Gauḍīya sampradāya, he has also said that //avaiṣṇava gurur na sa syāt. Sa.// He says that---I forget that verse---that "A person..." //Pūta-hari-kathāmṛtaṁ śravaṇaṁ na kartavyam. Avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇa-pūta-hari-kathāmṛtaṁ śravaṇaṁ na kartavyam.// He says that "You do not try to hear from a person who is //avaiṣṇava, hari-kathāmṛtam.//" The //hari-kathā,// the message of Kṛṣṇa like //Bhagavad-gītā// and other, //Bhāgavata, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// you should not hear from a person who is not a Vaiṣṇava. In the //Bhāgavata// also it is said, //satāṁ prasaṅgāt mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ-kathāḥ// [[books:sb:3:25:25|[SB 3.25.25]]] When we hear from //sad-vekti//[?], or Vaiṣṇava, then we get real effect. So if one argues that "//Hari-kathā// is pure. Even a //avaiṣṇava// speaks, what is the harm there?" so Sanātana Gosvāmī said in connection with this that //śravaṇaṁ na kartavyaṁ sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payo yathā.// Just like milk: it is very nice food, but if it is touched with the lips of a snake, it becomes poisonous. Therefore it is concluded that we have to hear the transcendental message of Kṛṣṇa from a realized soul, a devotee.

So this hearing process is recommended, that you should hear from a realized person who is //sadācara-sampanna-vaiṣṇava.// So who is a //bhakta?// Because you have to learn from a //bhakta,// so who is a //bhakta?// That is also described. So it is stated in the //śāstras// and the Gosvāmīs as //sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]: "Anyone who has no more designation, and he is pure from material contamination." //Upādhi// means so long we think that "I am this body," that means I am decorated with this //upādhi.// So long we think that "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am //brāhmaṇa,//" "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," we are decorated with //upādhi. Upādhi-śūnya// is described in the //Vedas,// when one understands //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// So there are two Brahmans: Para-brahman and ordinary Brahman. Para-brahman is the Supreme, //vibhu,// and ordinary Brahman, they are //anu.// Para-brahman is all-pervading, and Brahman is not all-pervading. So Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that //kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata// [[books:bg:13:3|[Bg. 13.3]]]. //Kṣetra, kṣetrajña,// when He was describing, //kṣetra// means this body, and //kṣetrajña// means the soul who knows about his body.

So there are two //kṣetrajñas.// One //kṣetrajña// is the //jīva,// soul, and another //kṣetrajña// is Paramātmā, Bhagavān. [break] ...clearly distinguished by Kṛṣṇa that //kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi:// "You are not only //kṣetrajña.//" The //jīva// soul is //kṣetrajñā.// He knows, just like you know, I know, "It is my body." So there are two //kṣetrajñas.// One //kṣetrajña// I am. Just like I know this is my body, you know this is your body, but I do not know what is going on in your body, you do not know what is going on in my body. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says //ca, eva, kṣetrajñaṁ ca api māṁ viddhi:// "Not only you are //kṣetrajña;// I am also //kṣetrajña// because I am Para-brahman, or Supersoul." But what is difference between these two //kṣetrajñas?// The difference is that one //kṣetrajña// knows about his own body, but the super-//kṣetrajña,// He knows everyone's body.

So in this way if we understand our position, that Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is the great and we are small, that is perfect knowledge. Therefore Kṛṣṇa commands, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. As the master commands the servant that "What, rascal, you are doing? What I say, you do it." [break] There are two living entities: one, the superior, who orders, and the other, inferior, who carries out the order. This is further explained in the Fifteenth Chapter of the //Bhagavad-gītā. Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭho mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. He says, Lord Kṛṣṇa said, that "I am situated in everyone's heart. I am giving order." //Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam.// And then the //jīvātmā// gets knowledge and carries it out.

So when one is perfectly in knowledge of //kṣetra, kṣetrajña,// then his devotional life begins. This understanding of the relationship between God and ourself is more clearly explained by Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He says, //jīvera 'svarūpa' haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]]. Our real identity is that we are eternally servant of God. This understanding, pure understanding, is called //mukti.// When we understand that "Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is my eternal master, and I am eternal servant of Him," that is called //mukti.// The //mukti// definition is given in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: muktir hitva anyathā rūpaṁ sva-rūpeṇa avasthiti// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. //Mukti// means when we give up our wrong ideas and we stay in our real identification. That is called //mukti.// So a //bhakta// who understands clearly that "I am eternal servant of God, and God is my eternal master," this very understanding means //mukti.// If I wrongly think that "I am something of this material world" or "I am God myself," these are misunderstanding. There is no question of //mukti.// Here the word is //kecit kevalayā:// "somebody."

The purpose is that most people, they are either //karmīs// or //jñānīs. Karmīs// or //jñānīs. Karmīs// means those who are working very hard day and night for sense gratification, and //jñānis// means after being frustrated in such activities, he tries to give up this world, //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.// This is not //jñāna,// that //brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.// If //brahma// is //satya,// then //jagat// is also //satya. Jñāna// means to know real fact. The real fact is that as Brahman is //satya,// anything which is emanated from Brahman, that is also //satya.// In the //Vedānta-sūtra// it begins like this: //athāto brahma jijñāsā,// "Now we have to inquire about Brahman." So about this description, Brahman, //yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante.// And in the //Vedānta-sūtra// it is said, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Anything which is emanating... Everything which is emanating from a particular source, that is Brahman. So what is that original source of everything? That is explained in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]: "From Me everything is emanating." Therefore Kṛṣṇa is Para-brahman. Therefore the conclusion is that if you come to the platform of //bhakti,// then automatically you become liberated.

So it is also confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā,//

> mam cāvyabhicāriṇi
> bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

In order to become //mukta,// or Brahman platform, one has to render unalloyed service to the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa. So here it is said, //kecit kevalayā bhaktyā// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]. //Kecit,// somebody---not the //karmīs,// not the //jñānīs,// not the //yogīs//---can execute devotional service. The //karmīs,// it is openly known that they want to enjoy. They want something. Similarly, //jñānīs,// they want to become one with the Supreme. That is also wanting something. The //yogīs// also, they want something, some mystic power. So //karmīs, jñānīs, yogīs,// all of them wanting something; the subject matter of want may be different. But a //bhakta,// he does not want anything. He simply wants to be engaged in carrying out the orders of the Supreme Lord. But such person is very, very rare. [break] ...out of many millions of //karmīs,// one may be //jñānī.// And out of many millions of //jñānīs,// one may become //mukta.// And out of many, many millions of //muktas,// one may become a //bhakta.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. //Siddhaye// means to become perfect //jñānī// or perfect //yogī.// And //yatatām api siddhānām:// and amongst the //siddhas,// those who have got perfection in //jñāna// and //yoga, kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ:// "Some of them may..." Not some of them---"May be someone is able to understand Me." Therefore in this verse it is clearly said //kecit,// the same thing. //Kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ.// To become a //bhakta// is not so easy. Therefore he says //kecit:// "somebody." Somebody, //eka// personality, may become a //bhakta.// So //kecit kevalayā bhaktyā// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]].

//Kevalayā. Kevalayā// means unalloyed, pure. //Kevalayā bhakti// means //śuddha-bhakti,// unalloyed //bhakti.// Otherwise //bhakti// is sometimes mixed with //jñāna// and sometimes mixed with //yoga,// mixed with //karma.// Because //karmīs, jñānīs// and //yogīs,// they have got some desire to be fulfilled. [break] The //karmīs,// they want to be elevated to the heavenly planet; the //jñānīs,// they want to become one with the Supreme Lord; and the //yogīs,// they want some power to exhibit so that they may be honored as God. [break] [explaining to translator:] The //yoga,// mystic power, //aṇimā, laghimā, siddhi,// like that. [break] But //bhakti// means one must be freed from all these desires. Therefore Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī gives the definition of //bhakti, anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]: "without any other desire." "Other" means //bhukti, mukti, siddhi:// to enjoy this material world or to become one with the God or to get some mystic power. So the //bhakti// means //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam,// no //karmī's// desire, no //jñānī's// desire, no //yogī's// desire. So //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]].

So one should be cleansed from the desires of //jñāna, karma, yoga.// He should be desireless. So these are all material desires. So when one gives up these material desires, then he is desireless. But one cannot be desireless. That is not possible. Then he is dead and gone. So desirelessness means no material desires. So we cannot be desireless, but desirelessness means no //bhukti,// no yogic //siddhi,// neither oneness, monism, to merge into the Supreme. These are all material desires. So //bhakti// means //ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttama// [[books:cc:madhya:19:167|[Cc. Madhya 19.167]]]. That is first-class //bhakti,// when we are ready to serve Kṛṣṇa as He orders. So to become ready to serve Kṛṣṇa is desirelessness. Otherwise a living entity, a living being, cannot be desireless.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is teaching how to become desirous to serve Kṛṣṇa. This teaching, perfection of instruction, we find in the //Bhagavad-gītā// when Arjuna says, //kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]: "I shall execute what You order me." //Te vacanaṁ tava:// "I shall execute any order which You order me." Arjuna was a warrior, soldier. When he was... Before his hearing //Bhagavad-gītā// he was a soldier, and after hearing //Bhagavad-gītā// he remained a soldier. But in the beginning of the fight he was not willing to fight with his brothers. Although Kṛṣṇa was speaking to him that "You fight," he was declining. This is the stage of //abhakta,// or nondevotee. Although mundane person will very much be pleased that "Arjuna was not willing to fight. He is nonviolent," but Kṛṣṇa was not accepting. So fighting is not a good business, so Arjuna was declining to fight. It was good from the worldly point of view. But after hearing //Bhagavad-gītā,// when Kṛṣṇa inquired from Arjuna, "What you have decided?" Arjuna replied, //naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtir labdhā kariṣye vacanaṁ tava// [[books:bg:18:73|[Bg. 18.73]]]: "Now I am quite in knowledge. I shall execute Your order." This is //mukti.// When we are prepared to execute the order of Kṛṣṇa, that is the platform of //mukti.//

Therefore it is said, //kecit kevalayā bhaktyā vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]. Simply by executing the order of Vasudeva one becomes //mukta.// Just like master and servant. If the servant executes the order of the master, he is faultless. If the servant declines to execute the order of the master, however qualified he may be, he is useless. So therefore it is said, //kevalayā bhaktyā:// "without any contamination, simply ready to execute the order of Kṛṣṇa, or Vasudeva." Therefore it is called //vāsudeva-parāyaṇā.// Therefore it is, in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is confirmed, //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]: "After many, many births of struggling, when one is actually //jñānavān,// wise, he surrenders unto Me." So either you become //karmī, jñānī// or //yogī,// you are not //mukta. Mukta// means, I have already defined, //mukti hitva anyathā rūpaṁ sva-rūpeṇa avasthiti.// When you stay in your own original position to execute the order of Kṛṣṇa, that is //mukti.//

So in the previous verses the mode of progress is //tapasa brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena vā// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. These things are to be executed. But here in these verses, simply if you become a pure devotee, then it is to be understood that you have already executed //tapasā, brahmācārya, śama, dama,// everything. As soon as you surrender to Kṛṣṇa...

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇam
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi...
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

That our miserable condition of life is due to our material attraction, or //pāpa,// impious activities. Here it is confirmed that //kevalayā bhaktyā, aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena:// totally you can kill all reaction of sinful activities. And a very good example is given here: //nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ. Nīhāra// means fog. In the fog you cannot see what is there in your front. But as soon as there is sunrise, immediately fog is dissipated. Therefore,

> bahūnāṁ janmanam ante
> jñānavān māṁ prapadyate
> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti
> sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ
> [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]

When we understand that Vāsudeva is the Supreme, //sa mahātmā,// then we become the great //mahātmā.//

So if you accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then life of ignorance will finish, and you come to the light and become liberated. If you come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the light is there. Therefore the darkness of life is dissipated. Therefore it is said, //ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [Nārada Pañcarātra]: "If you have learned how to worship Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then there is no more use of your //tapasya.//" [break] //...ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim:// "And if you cannot understand Hari, then what is the use of your //tapasya?//" //Antar-bahir yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim:// "If you can see Hari, Kṛṣṇa, within yourself and outside yourself, then what is the use of //tapasya?//" //Nantar-bahir, antar-bahir yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim:// "And if you have not learned to see Kṛṣṇa, Hari, within yourself and outside, then what is the use of your //tapasya?//"

So this movement is giving the chance to everyone. It doesn't mean for any particular nation, particular country or particular person. For everyone. Caitanya Mahaprabhu said, "All over the world." Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "All over the world, in every village and every town, this message will be spread." And that is being done now. So it is a great movement. I request you all to join wholeheartedly.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
