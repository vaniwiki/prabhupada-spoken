====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So, of course, those days also not costly, 1945. I was paying only 200 rupees. Now you cannot get one room. So because it was famous, that ghost-hauntly house, nobody was taking it. So I took it. [laughs] I don’t care for ghost. Actually there was ghost. And all the servants, they said, "Bābājī, therefore retire." They met. But I was chanting. [break] [man heard in another room ringing bell and chanting //mantras//] He is going to chant?

**Bhavānanda:**
I think he washed his hands. This is his father here. [break] [end]
