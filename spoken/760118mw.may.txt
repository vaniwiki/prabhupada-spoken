====== Morning Walk ======

**Madhudviṣa:**
//...Bhāgavatam// you say that we should greet the sun with the verse from Gāyatrī //mantra.// Does that means we should wait for sunrise to say our Gāyatrī? Just as the sun is rising, we should say the Gāyatrī.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Early in the morning. [//gurukula// boys chanting in background]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sometimes we take bath before sunrise and put on //tilaka.// Should the //mantra// be said at that time, after putting on //tilaka?// Or should we wait and then say it...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...when the sun rises? After //tilaka?//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. //Tilaka// should be done after bathing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And then when should the Gāyatrī be said? Right after...

**Prabhupāda:**
After //tilaka.// Gāyatrī //mantra// is description of the sun. [break] ...our land?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Jayapatāka:**
This is wheat growing here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayapatāka:**
This is wheat growing.

**Prabhupāda:**
This land?

**Jayapatāka:**
This is not our land.

**Prabhupāda:**
And this? Up to this...?

**Bhavānanda:**
This is our land, and this is our land. This is not. [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Would it be nice to have lampposts here? Little lampposts to light the road?

**Prabhupāda:**
[pause] It is cold. [laughs] [break] Where? No. That's nice. Nice for barefooted. It is there, up. [break] You have to make little shade like this, just like upon the wall the shade is there. You make to the walls so that the water may not spoil the painting.

**Bhavānanda:**
Oh, on the front wall.

**Jayapatāka:**
A little sun screen.

**Bhavānanda:**
Sun..., rain screen.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
Stick it one foot out, one, two feet out.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Not two foot. One, one-half foot will do.

**Jayapatāka:**
I was thinking that this morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when I woke up.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
You must have been thinking... I woke up thinking that the paintings needed a sun screen because rain will fall on them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which way? [break] All the members, they should water in front. Hmm? Just like if somebody remains in this room, he must water. Then there will be no difficulty. Here is water. So anyway, you have to engage them. Why it will dry? [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
You suggested //prasādam,// books, cloth...

**Prabhupāda:**
Cloth you are not going to sell. Cloth, are you going to sell?

**Jayapatāka:**
We can take donations for cloth. We won't sell. We'll take donations for cloth.

**Prabhupāda:**
That, for that purpose...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is the harm of selling cloth, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, then you will require extra energy.

**Jayapatāka:**
No, I mean our own production, not outside.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, your production... You should make production for your necessities.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The American devotees, when they come, they want to purchase the cloth.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is amongst ourselves, not public. That one can purchase from that side. Why a shop? You make one utensil shop, //bāsana, bāsana, karatāla.// So one, //prasādam;// one, //bāsana;// and another?

**Jayapatāka:**
Books.

**Prabhupāda:**
Books. And another? Four you have got.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You know those quotations you gave from your Guru Mahārāja? Yesterday you wrote some quotations?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here is a place where they might be displayed. This is a blank place.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes. There it should be written.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is very prominent.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not only there; here also.

**Jayapatāka:**
In big letters here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And there are so many places. Yes. First of all you place this and the other. We can give the //upadeśa// of Prabhupāda. I'll give you matter for writing. So writing, that charges should be reduced. One...

**Jayapatāka:**
Yesterday Caitya-guru, the man he brought from Calcutta, he only wanted one rupee, seventy-five paisa.

**Prabhupāda:**
For painting. And for writing that should be...

**Jayapatāka:**
Writing, maybe one twenty-five.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. One. One. Make it one.

**Jayapatāka:**
One rupee.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Which way we shall go?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This way. We haven't gone walking this way.

**Prabhupāda:**
So where you are going to give that shade upon?

**Jayapatāka:**
So what we'd have to do is we'd have to break the top.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayapatāka:**
We'd have to break the top and then...

**Prabhupāda:**
Break? Why break? Another expenditure. Simply you make two brackets, wooden brackets, like that, and have a tin. That's all.

**Jayapatāka:**
Tin.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tin or steel. Why breaking, again another?

**Jayapatāka:**
There's already a... I was thinking about the rain, if it's falling straight down, that will be somewhat protected by this arch. Only if the rain is coming from this side, and even then it won't protect...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. The arch will... That's all right. Then don't require. Then it is all right. Don't require. [break] It will be colder in Bengal. //Māghi, Māgha-māsa.// Who has done this mischief, "Māyāpur"?

**Devotee:**
Someone put mud over "Māyāpur."

**Jayapatāka:**
This is our land, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayapatāka:**
This is our land here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which one?

**Jayapatāka:**
This, with the wheat. We have a tube well there. We irrigate these lands. There are six and sixty, twelve //bīghā.// [break] ...last year's harvest. We haven't had to purchase any wheat this year.

**Prabhupāda:**
The //cāpāṭi// we eat, that is our wheat?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good, yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
[break] //...bīghā// is also ours.

**Prabhupāda:**
This one?

**Jayapatāka:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What you have grown there?

**Jayapatāka:**
Chickpeas.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's nice. Chickpea, //cāpāṭi, gūr//---first class. [laughter] And milk.

**Jayapatāka:**
[break] ...land next to us, this gentleman.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with Indian man] Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is his name?

**Jayapatāka:**
Vakreshvar. He worked on our original house. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see how... [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
In the rainy season the Ganges, when it rises high, it comes through here. It runs right by the birth site. They say this is the original Ganges, over here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Gurukula boys:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa!

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya. Brahmacārīs.//

**Jayapatāka:**
[break] Not so many //ghoṣas// come for //prasādam.// Little cows. [break] [end]
