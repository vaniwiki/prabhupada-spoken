====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...in Europe and America, but they haven't got house like this. Have you got?

**Sudāmā:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then? Spriritual advancement. That is India's facility. Throughout the whole universe. Not only on this planet but throughout the whole universe. India has got the facility---Bhāratavarṣa. Therefore Caitanya Mahaprabhu says, //bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma jāra.// If somebody has got this opportunity of to take birth in India, Bhāratavarṣa, he is the right person to distribute the real knowledge, //para-upakāra.// Otherwise they are in darkness. //Bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma jāra.// So, Jayapatākā Mahārāja, explain this. You have got practical experience.

**Jayapatākā:**
//Bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma jāra.// Those people who are born on the sacred land of Bhāratavarṣa, they should perfect their life, //janma sārthaka kari',// and help others. Purpose of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is to perfect one's own spiritual knowledge and then to go and help other people. So people that are born here in Bhāratavarṣa have a special facility because of the Vedic culture, Āryan culture, to perfect their lives. And just as Śrīla Prabhupāda has gone all over the world spreading the Kṛṣṇa consciousness---one person from this Bhāratavarṣa has been able to do so much---if other pure devotees would come and preach as Śrīla Prabhupāda has done, then how many unlimited amount of fallen souls could receive the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...in so-called transcendental meditation, go to the Himalaya and go to the forest. We are not interested in all this nonsense. Our only business is to spread //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, door to door, town to town, city to city. We are not going to seclusion. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "This is professional bluff: 'I am going to the Himalaya. I am going to the forest.' " Prahlāda Mahārāja condemns, that "These are professional bluffs." Or they may be sincere, but still, they are trying for their own salvation. Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "I am not interested in that sal... I am interested for everyone's salvation. Everyone must go back to home, back to..." That is Vaiṣṇava. Not that "For my own salvation I go to Himalaya or in the forest and transcendental meditation," nonsense. We are not interested in those things. [laughs] And our men... Just like that Gaurasundara. He is doing all nonsense, transcendental meditation. Is it not?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rascal. He is doing transcendental meditation. He got so much opportunity to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He did it in the beginning very nicely. A rascal, he became victim. These things are for //ajitendriyāṇām.// Those who are not able to control the senses, they make this business, transcendental meditation, and secretly doing all nonsense. The whole thing, this transcendental meditation, that, what is that, Maharishi Yogi, they are doing all nonsense and advertising, "We are transcendental meditation."

**Hari-śauri:**
They openly advertise that "If you do transcendental meditation, then you can do your business better, you can have better sex life."

**Prabhupāda:**
And that's all. [laughs] So you can do your sense gratification process, //yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi tuccham,// what is condemned by Prahlāda Mahārāja, that "This kind of happiness is most abominable and insignificant." //Tuccham. Tuccham// means "very insignificant." //Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. It is just like itching between the two hand, and after-result is misery. That's all. //Iva duḥkha-duḥkham. Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. They know it, that after this enjoyment of itching sensation there will be so much trouble. But //neha tṛpyanti:// they are not satisfied. Again and again. //Bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.// Begetting one child... Just see. It is going on. [//gurukula// children in background] No shame. That is animal. No shame. In Western countries they are learning... I have seen. In Los Angeles beach they are having sex, open, just like these birds or beasts. //Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.// They are trying to make birth control. Why? //Bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.// That illicit or legal sex, the after-result is very miserable.

**Jayapatākā:**
It seems that as a country, India's got the best chances for becoming fully Kṛṣṇa conscious again.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everywhere chance. Kṛṣṇa does not say for India.

**Jayapatākā:**
I mean, but first.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That is not... You are making better progress, Western countries. Kṛṣṇa is not limited anywhere. But in India they have got the facilities. But they are becoming rascals, so they are not taking the facility. The facility is there. That is everywhere, especially in India. You see everywhere, every day, the sunrise, so beautiful. In Western country, some places, sometimes. But here you'll find every day. That is the facility. This is Gāyatrī //mantra. Oṁ bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ tat savitur vareṇyaṁ bhargo devasya dhīmahi.// This facility is in here. You get sufficient sunlight, and in sunlight you keep very healthy and happy. That facility is here.

**Bhavānanda:**
Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, last night you were saying, "The sun is moving." We can see the sun has just come up and is moving across the sky. So what do they base their statement that the sun is stationary? They have no basis in fact.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore rascals. They see one thing and speak another. That is rascal. //Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta...// Huh? //Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ// [//Bs. 5.52//]. //Aśeṣa-tejāḥ.// The..., //aśeṣa-tejāḥ,// unlimited temperature and light. They are studied. This is //aśeṣa-tejāḥ.// If they have studied the quality of the sun, how they can say something wrong about the movements? That is also right. //Yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakro govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi// [//Bs. 5.52//]. This is statement. //Bhramati.// It is never discussed, //sthira.// Fixed up means //sthira. Bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.// And that is also... That movement is also within the time limit fixed up by Kṛṣṇa: "Morning, half past six, you get up." "Yes." You cannot stop it, Kṛṣṇa's //ājñā.// It is order of Kṛṣṇa. You stop it, you scientists. You make it conveniently. Not half past six; make it eight. Can you do this? You rascal, you are claiming scientist. //Yasyājñayā.// It is only by His order you can... You ask him to rise from this side. Why from this side? Is there any scientist can change? Then why they are claiming that there is no God? Huh? What is the answer? Hmm? //Yasyājñayā.// There is some arrangement. What is their answer? Hmm? Jagadīśa Prabhu? What is the answer?

**Jagadīśa:**
There is no... We don't see how God is working. We don't see...

**Prabhupāda:**
Are you blind? God is working. //Yasyājñayā bhramati. Yasya,// by His order he is rising. Why don't you see God? It is not your order or your scientist order. Somebody's order. That is God.

**Jagadīśa:**
But there doesn't seem to be any meaning. There doesn't seem to be any meaning.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the meaning?

**Jagadīśa:**
There is no meaning.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the meaning?

**Jagadīśa:**
It's just evolution. There's no meaning. What's the meaning?

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not follow what is the meaning. The sun is rising half past six, exactly at the time. So there is no meaning?

**Jagadīśa:**
We can't tell what the meaning is.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is... Because you are rascal, you do not know. You learn it, one who knows the meaning. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. You are fool, rascal. How can you know the meaning? You must have to go to the real person.

**Jagadīśa:**
Who knows?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Guru.// Therefore we go to //guru. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. One who is actually serious about inquiring, he must go. //Guruṁ prapadyeta.// Must surrender to //guru.//

**Śāstrījī:**
//Śābde pare ca niṣṇātam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. That is... Therefore there is //guru. Ādau gurvāśrayam.// If you know, want to know, first of all take shelter of //guru.// That is the injunction.

**Bhavānanda:**
Then we will ask, how do we know who is really //guru?//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another rascaldom. You see how others are taking //guru, paramparā// system. You are rascal. You will place so many questions. But the answers are already there. //Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. //Guru// is he who knows Kṛṣṇa, who explains Kṛṣṇa. That is //guru.// Otherwise he's not //guru.//

**Dayānanda:**
//Samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham// [MU 1.2.12].

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. Anyone who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, who knows Kṛṣṇa, he is //guru.// Otherwise all rascals. Why should you go to a rascal? Immediately you can understand he is //guru// who has fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. He is //guru.// Others? They are all rascals. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. Who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is under these four groups: //duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.// They may talk of so much knowledge, but they are rascal fools because they have not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. All the Māyāvādīs, they are all rascals. They have not surrendered. This is the test. Why don't you take lesson from //Bhagavad-gītā?// He is //guru.// One who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, one is servant of Kṛṣṇa, he is //guru.// That is the test. If you want to select a //guru,// you have to see "Whether this person is fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa?" Then he is //guru.// Huh? What is the definition of //guru// given by...? Why don't you read all these things? Why you remain fools and rascals? Why...? We are following Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //āmāra ājñāya guru hañā.// You become a //guru.// How? //Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. That's a //guru.// Why don't you see all these instructions? And you are presenting yourself as following Caitanya Mahāprabhu? Why? Answer. Why you remain fool and rascal? If you want to remain fool and rascal and question, that is not very good. You must know who is //guru.// And you say, "I do not know who is //guru.//" Why? Hmm? What is the answer? //Guru// is defined by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. We are chanting daily, //śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī advaita gadādhara śrī...// Take their lesson. Otherwise why you are praying, //śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu nityānanda?// You, rather, glorify Hitler or Mussolini. Make them //guru.// Everything is there. You cannot say that "I do not understand." Do not understand means you do not take. What is the...? All right? [laughter]

**Devotees:**
[laughing] Yes!

**Bhavānanda:**
You are giving one version of //Bhagavad-gītā,// but there are so many versions of //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Bhavānanda:**
You are giving one version of //Bhagavad-gītā,// but there are so many versions.

**Prabhupāda:**
If you can learn one, then your life will be successful for many thousand years. Hmm? //Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.// You simply understand one verse of //Bhagavad-gītā;// then you understand everything. This is the meaning. //Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.// [Bengali with Śāstrījī]

**Sudāmā:**
I remember once you said, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that it took Arjuna less than forty-five minutes, he understood. But for us it is taking, for materialistic men...

**Prabhupāda:**
Forty-five thousand years. [laughter] [laughs] Who is therefore //mūḍhas?// Intelligent men can answer, understand everything, in a minute. And if he's a fool, rascal, even forty-five thousand years he cannot understand. We are giving the best service to the whole world, trying to make them educated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break]

**Sudāmā:**
...very curious: "What is the power and mystery of A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, how he is doing so many things but yet he does not appear like these others //yogīs// who are..., like Satya Sai Baba who is making magic and..."

**Prabhupāda:**
But why? Because they have no eyes. Has Satya Sai Baba so many properties all over the world? He is creating gold, but has he got so many properties? One property like this? Huh? I started this business with forty rupees; now it is forty //crores.// [laughs] Has this rascal has any property like this? [laughter]

**Jayapatākā:**
He is producing ashes. [laughter]

**Bhavānanda:**
Just like Yogi Bhajan came, remember Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Berkeley, and he said, "I am simply here to try and understand how you are doing so greatly, how you are opening so many temples." He said, "I have simply come to try and understand that point, to learn your secret."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But his idea is that he will then sit and enjoy all of those things.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Nowadays all these //yogīs// and //svāmīs// are going. Even that blind saintly person...

**Hari-śauri:**
Gange...

**Prabhupāda:**
Gangeshvarananda. He also went. But coming back, he is disappointed. Nobody took care of him, although in India he is known as a great saintly person. They have no asset. They have no Kṛṣṇa; therefore they are beggars. //Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ// [[books:bg:6:20-23|[Bg. 6.22]]]. If one gets Kṛṣṇa, then he gets everything.

**Sudāmā:**
Therefore we pray, //viṣṇu-padāya kṛṣṇa-preṣṭhāya bhūtale, śrīmate bhaktivedānta-svāmin iti nāmine.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Not //viṣṇu-padāya. Viṣṇu-pādāya.// [pronounces with long "a"] The Prabhupāda and Viṣṇupāda, the same thing. Viṣṇu is //prabhu. Prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// [laughs] They say like that? Who says that?

**Sudāmā:**
Oh, that, how they are trying to understand your powers? Oh, yes, in one college I was lecturing in Kansas. Some students came to me, and they said, "We are amazed." They were disciples of this one bogus //yogī//---I cannot remember his name---and they were asking me, "How your //svāmī,// how your //guru// has got some power, we are trying to understand."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Sudāmā:**
I told them, "Yes, even we may be unwilling, still, we are forced to serve Kṛṣṇa by his grace and mercy."

**Prabhupāda:**
And even the students are asking. That means it has become widespread, if the small boys are asking. They are also studying. So why did you not say, "You are asking why he has become so famous, and still, you do not say more than other //yogīs?// You are asking this question, 'How he has become?' That means he has already become more than. So why you are asking this question?"

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think you are the only real resident of Bhāratavarṣa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Bhavānanda:**
You are the only real resident of Bhāratavarṣa. No one else has fulfilled that...

**Prabhupāda:**
At least historically it will be proved. [break] ...cause of envy of my Godbrothers. I was known... Although they knew that Prabhupāda liked me very much, because I am //gṛhastha,// I was known as //pacā-gṛhastha. Pacā-gṛhastha// means a rotten //gṛhastha.// And now they say, "This //gṛhastha// has come out more than us? What is this?" [break] Śrīdhara Mahārāja's chief disciple...?

**Bhavānanda:**
Gaura.

**Prabhupāda:**
He always used to say to Śrīdhara Mahārāja that "You are seeing Abhay Babu as //gṛhastha,// but he is more than many //yogīs.//" He was telling.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Even before.

**Prabhupāda:**
When I was //gṛhastha// they were my tenant. So, and he used to say. And then...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He knew. He saw you in your activities.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, he said that "Mahārāja, you are seeing he is //gṛhastha.// He is more than many //yogīs.//" He used to say, that boy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He has good sentiment, then.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //kibā vipra kibā śūdra nyāsī kene naya, yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya// [[books:cc:madhya:8:128|[Cc. Madhya 8.128]]]. It doesn't matter whether one is //gṛhastha// or a //sannyāsī.// [Bengali to passerby] [break] ...all big, big men, he was present. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, another twenty thousand dollars was transferred. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
He cannot complain. There is money; there is men; now you have to complete. You cannot say, "For this purpose, it..." No. [break] ...Mādhava Mahārāja, you can say that "Have you seen ever twenty thousand at a time?" And I am bringing daily twenty thousand. Twenty thousand dollars. Not money..., rupees, but dollars. "Have you seen twenty thousand dollars at a time?" [break] Detroit temple, you know? Jagadīśa? Are you going to negotiate.

**Jagadīśa:**
Where is this?

**Prabhupāda:**
Detroit, the temple.

**Jagadīśa:**
Oh, yes, Detroit temple. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And he was asking 350,000. So I told, "All right, you take cash, 300,000," and he immediately accepted, though I had not three paisa even in the bank. So immediately... The girl has paid?

**Jagadīśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
She agreed to pay half, and our Ambarīṣa agreed to pay half. It was purchased immediately.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Cash. And you only had three paisa. That means one who is servant of the richest, he is also.., he also becomes rich. You always said, "Serving the greatest, you become great."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. A big man's son squanders money and the father pays. Similarly, if you become a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, the father will spend for you. Why do you care wherefrom money comes?

**Bhavānanda:**
Just like, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you had Dai Nippon print fifty thousand dollars in books in the beginning.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Yes. Yes. I gave him five thousand, and I ordered him fifty-two thousand. And I told him, "The money will come." And he said that "Five thousand he is giving advance. Money will come." So they immediately published //Kṛṣṇa// book, forty thousand dollar worth.

**Sudāmā:**
And they told me, Śrīla Prabhupāda, later, that that was the first time in the history of their company that they would ever make any such concession.

**Prabhupāda:**
They told?

**Sudāmā:**
Yes. Mr. Ogata and Mr. Kugimoto said, "Somehow by his... He is such a great man, His Divine Grace, somehow we accepted." They were surprised. Remember when he went?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They were mystified by you, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
When I was coming back from America at that time, I came via Japan for this purpose. At that time you were in charge.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Your dealings with them were very memorable.

**Prabhupāda:**
They said, "How we agreed?" [laughs] They were surprised.

**Sudāmā:**
And whenever I would see the president... That one meeting you had with him... Whenever I would see the president after that, he would always ask me, "How is His Divine Grace? How is he feeling and where is he?"

**Prabhupāda:**
I challenged him, "You are Buddhist." "Yes." "You are eating meat?" "Yes." "What is this?" [laughs] That was my first talking with him.

**Sudāmā:**
They were wanting to talk business for a long time. You were simply preaching to them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu went to the Kazi. His first question was that "What kind of religion you are following, you are killing your father and mother?" This was His beginning of the talk. "What kind of religion it is?" "How is that? I am killing my father, mother?" "Yes, cow is your mother and bull is your father. You are killing them. The bull is giving you grains by working in the field, and the mother is giving you milk, and you are killing them." This was his first question. So this is a civilization of killing father and mother. All over the world they are killing bulls and cows. In England there is law that you can maintain a cow but you cannot maintain a bull. It must be killed. Yes. When I was a guest in John Lennon's house, the manager in charge, he was telling me, "You cannot keep bull. This is our law." I learned from him.

**Hari-śauri:**
Only for breeding purposes. Only for breeding. All the rest are killed.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is law in England? So you cannot keep even bull privately. Must be killed. This is the law.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is the reason for that law?

**Prabhupāda:**
Bull will not supply milk, so there is no use. It must be killed. Otherwise they are ferocious animal. You have made this law. The cows may be given some time to be killed, but the bulls should be killed immediately. This is their law.

**Hari-śauri:**
Nor do the farmers actually want to keep them anyway.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Hari-śauri:**
They are useless animals.

**Prabhupāda:**
Simply expensive. But here in India they know how to utilize bulls---for transportation, for plowing and so many other things.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Such a shortage of fuel, but there is no shortage of fuel with a bull.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, rather, it will supply you //gobar,// fuel. Whatever he will eat, he will give you fuel.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In return.

**Prabhupāda:**
In return.

**Jayapatākā:**
But now the government is trying to teach the people that they should buy tractors and kill the calves.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Jayapatākā:**
They want to have..., make tractors popular and then...

**Prabhupāda:**
Kill the bulls. They were criticizing us, because in our //gośālā// we maintain the male calves.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, when our Harikeśa was struck by a bull and he was taken in the hospital, the doctor was criticizing, "If you have killed the bulls, then this condition would not have come to you."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Wow. //Karma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. There will be no accident because this..., the acci...You know that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I heard about the accident.

**Prabhupāda:**
There was some accident, and he was taken to hospital. So he was advised, "Because you do not kill the bulls, therefore this is the accident." As if without killing..., by killing the bulls there is no accident. And they do not cite the accident by motorcar, greater bulls. Accident will be there.

**Jayapatākā:**
Yesterday we planted paddy, paddy field.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. That's nice. But this is going to be a lawn?

**Jayapatākā:**
Yes. It will have flower bushes and //tulasī// around after the construction. The botanical director suggested that on the one end we make a little arbor covering of vine that Your Divine Grace could sit there and give lecture from there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatākā:**
And the devotees could sit on the lawn.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, very nice. Mr. Agarwal said?

**Jayapatākā:**
Not Mr. Agarwal. Mr. Mitra, the deputy director of the botanical gardens.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Jayapatākā:**
He came out here and gave one design. From Howrah Botanical Garden?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. He is the in-charge? Superintendent.

**Jayapatākā:**
Yes. He came with his wife and family. They were very pleased. He stayed for a day or so and then made a whole plan for us. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Sun is moving---that //uttarāyaṇam// and //dakṣiṇāyanam.// This //ayanam// means //gamanam.// Is it not?

**Jayapatākā:**
Northern and southern course.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (1):**
In //Bhagavad-gītā// there is mention, when //yogīs...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere it is ment...

**Śāstrījī:**
//Agnir jyotir ahaḥ śuklaḥ ṣaṇ-māsā uttarāyaṇam// [[books:bg:8:24|[Bg. 8.24]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. That is in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// [break] ...line there will be pillars? No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Arches. Just like on your veranda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, arches.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Exact same pattern. It will keep the same pattern.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Sudāmā:**
But on this one time should we bathe directly?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you can bathe //śālagrāma.//

**Sudāmā:**
Bathe //śālagrāma.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Bathe the //śālagrāma-śilā.//

**Sudāmā:**
Place Him... Place the Deity there and //śālagrāma// in front of Them and then bathe //śālagrāma.// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...made so gigantic and so opulent. And we make Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gate? How foolish they are. The doorkeeper?

**Jayapatākā:**
I challenged them that "Why you are putting Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gateway?" So they say, "Well, this was in memory, because when..." They say when Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was a magistrate that he used to go there and he used to watch the local people do their..., do some sports and horse-racing and things, and so as memory they are making there.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you are so intelligent. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was not so intelligent that he could place him, but you are so very intelligent, you are surpassing Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. So you are intelligent or fool? You should answer like this.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jumping over //guru.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Monkey's business.

**Prabhupāda:**
He could not understand where Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura should be placed. You have understood. You are so intelligent, overintelligent. That means rascals. Overintelligent means rascal. Bhaktisiddhānta Ṭhākura, he remained so many years, and he could not understand. You have understood to make Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura a gatekeeper. You tell him next time when you..., that "You are overintelligent." [break] ...statue of..., picture, I think, of Bhakti... That Sakhi Babu.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Which //bābu?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Sakhi Babu.

**Jayapatākā:**
Yes, Sakhi Babu, he is there.

**Bhavānanda:**
Opposite.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that means he is on the same level. [break] ...Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura on the gate is the proof how fool he is. He has not shown respect to Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura; he has disgraced.

**Jayapatākā:**
Now the government is saying that they have to knock down those temples because of the encroaching on the roadside.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now where Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura...?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Will go now? What was... What was your Guru Mahārāja's plan for where he...? I don't understand. I mean, did your Guru Mahārāja want a...

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's statue was there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So why was...

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhaktivinoda... Because it was their... My Guru Mahārāja never tried to bring him here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So what happened?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So they did it?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's picture was there, not that on the gateway.

**Bhavānanda:**
In the back.

**Prabhupāda:**
They should have taken away that building which was constructed, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, and placed him there as separate temple. You see? That red... That was constructed by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You mean that school building?

**Bhavānanda:**
No, no, in the back.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just on the side of the temple.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yeah. Old building.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. If they wanted to show some respect, they should have installed him there.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Just next to the temple. Your Guru Mahārāja did not build because there was something already in Svarūpa Gañja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So why don't they be satisfied...?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they are bigger than Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's not their position.

**Prabhupāda:**
Overintelligent.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I remember one time Kārttikeya Mahārāja was chanting to a picture of Bhaktisiddhānta. You chastised him and said, "What is your connection with Bhaktisiddhānta? Your connection is with me."

**Prabhupāda:**
Who said?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You did.

**Sudāmā:**
You did. I remember.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When Kārttikeya Mahārāja was chanting to your Guru Mahārāja's picture, you said, "How you can connect with him? Your connection was with me." [end]
