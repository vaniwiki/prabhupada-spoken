**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Translation: "This was spoken by a //brāhmaṇa// from Avantī deśa. 'I shall cross over the insurmountable ocean of nescience by being firmly fixed in the service of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. This was approved by the previous //ācāryas,// who are fixed in firm devotion to the Lord, Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.' " Purport. "In connection with this verse, which is a quotation from the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Eleventh Canto, Twenty-third Chapter, [sic] fifty-eighth verse, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura says that of the sixty-four items required for rendering devotional service, acceptance of the symbolic marks of //sannyāsa// is a regulative principle. If one accepts the //sannyāsa// order, his main business is to devote his life completely to the service of Mukunda, Kṛṣṇa. If one does not completely devote his mind and body to the service of the Lord, he does not actually become a //sannyāsī.// It is not simply a matter of changing dress. In //Bhagavad-gītā,// Sixth Chapter, first verse, it is also stated, //anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca:// [[books:bg:6:1|[Bg. 6.1]]] 'One who works devotedly for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa is a //sannyāsī.//' The dress is not //sannyāsa,// but the attitude of service to Kṛṣṇa is.

"The word //paramātmā niṣṭhā// means being a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. //Parātmā-vigraha. Parātmā,// the Supreme Person, is Kṛṣṇa. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. Those who are completely dedicated to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa in service are actually //sannyāsīs.// As a matter of formality, the devotee accepts the //sannyāsa// dress as previous //ācāryas// did. He also accepts the three //daṇḍas.// Later, Viṣṇu Svāmī considered that accepting the dress of a //tridaṇḍa// was //parātma-niṣṭhā.// Therefore sincere devotees add another //daṇḍa,// the //jīva daṇḍa,// to the three existing //daṇḍas.// The Vaiṣṇava //sannyāsī// is known as //tridaṇḍī-sannyāsī.// The Māyāvādī //sannyāsī// accepts only one //daṇḍa,// not understanding the purpose of //tridaṇḍa.// Later, many persons in the community of Śiva Svāmī gave up the //ātma-niṣṭhā,// devotional service of the Lord, and followed the paths of Śaṅkarācārya. Instead of accepting 108 names, those in the Śiva Svāmī //sampradāya// follow the path of Śaṅkarācārya and accept the ten names of //sannyāsa.// Although Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the then existing order of //sannyāsa,// namely //ekadaṇḍa,// He still recited from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// about the //tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa// accepted by the //brāhmaṇa// of Avantīpura. Indirectly He declared that within the //ekadaṇḍa// [one //daṇḍa//], four //daṇḍas// existed as one. Accepting //ekadaṇḍa sannyāsa// without //parātma-niṣṭhā,// devotional service to Lord Kṛṣṇa, is not acceptable to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. In addition, according to the exact regulative principles, one should add the //jīva-daṇḍa// to the //tridaṇḍa.// These four //daṇḍas// bound together as one are symbolic of unalloyed devotional service to the Lord. Because the //ekadaṇḍī-sannyāsīs// of the Māyāvāda school are not devoted to the service of Kṛṣṇa, they try to merge into the Brahman effulgence, which is a marginal position between material and spiritual existence. They accept this impersonal position as liberation. Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// not knowing that Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a //tridaṇḍī,// think of Caitanya Mahāprabhu as an //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsī.// This is due to their //vivarta,// bewilderment. In //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// there is no such thing as //ekadaṇḍī sannyāsī.// Indeed, the //tridaṇḍī-sannyāsī// is accepted as the symbolic representation of the //sannyāsa// order. By citing this verse from //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted the //sannyāsa// order recommended in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// The Māyāvādī //sannyāsīs,// who are enamored of the external energy of the Lord, cannot understand the mind of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

"To date, all the devotees of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, following in His footsteps, accept the //sannyāsa// order and keep the sacred thread and tuft of unshaved hair. The //ekadaṇḍī-sannyāsīs// of the //Māyāvādī// school give up the sacred thread and do not keep any tuft of hair. Therefore they are unable to understand the purport of //tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa,// and as such, they are not inclined to dedicate their lives to the service of Mukunda. They simply think of merging into the existence of Brahman because of their disgust with material existence. The //ācāryas// who advocate the //daiva-varṇāśrama,// the social order of //cātur-varṇyam// mentioned in //Bhagavad-gītā,// do not accept the proposition of //asura-varṇāśrama,// which maintains the social code of //varṇa// is indicated by birth.

"The most intimate devotee of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, namely Gadādhara Paṇḍita, accepted //tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa// and also accepted Mādhava Upadhyaya as his //tridaṇḍī-sannyāsī// disciple. It is said that from this Madhvācārya, the //sampradāya// known in Western India as Vallabhācārya //sampradāya// has begun. Śrīla Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Vasu, who is known as //smṛti-ācārya// in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava //sampradāya,// later accepted the //tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa// from Tridaṇḍipāda Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī. Although acceptance of //tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa// is not distinctly mentioned in the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava literature, the first verse of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī's //Upadeśāmṛta// advocates that one should accept the //tridaṇḍa-sannyāsa// order by controlling the six forces:

> vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ
> jihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam
> etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ
> sarvām apīmāṁ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt
> [NoI 1]

“ 'One who can control the forces of speech, mind, anger, belly, tongue and genitals is known as a //gosvāmī// and is competent to accept disciples all over the world.' The followers of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu never accepted the Māyāvāda order of //sannyāsa,// and for this, they cannot be blamed. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted Śrīdhara Swami, who was a //tridaṇḍī sannyāsī,// but the Māyāvāda //sannyāsīs,// not understanding Śrīdhara Swami, sometimes think that Śrīdhara Swami belonged to the Māyāvāda //ekadaṇḍa sannyāsa// community. Actually this was not the case."

**Prabhupāda:**
So you should understand the purpose of taking //sannyāsa// by the example given by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself. It is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,//

> tyaktvā su-dustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ
> dharmiṣṭha ārya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam
> māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvad
> vande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam
> [SB 11.5.34]

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was resident of this place where you are taking //sannyāsa.// So what was the purpose of His taking //sannyāsa?// He was very respectable //brāhmaṇa,// Nimāi Paṇḍita. This tract of land, Navadvīpa, is the place of highly educated //brāhmaṇas// from time immemorial. So Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu belonged to a very respectable //brāhmaṇa// family, the son of Jagannātha Miśra; His grandfather, Nīlāmbara Cakravartī. Very respectful, respectable persons. He took birth in that family. Personally He was very beautiful; therefore His another name is Gaurasundara. And He was very learned scholar also; therefore His another name is Nimāi Paṇḍita. So, and in His family life He had very nice, beautiful young wife, Viṣṇupriyā, and very affectionate mother, and He was very influential. You know that. In one day He collected about one hundred thousand followers to protest against the Kazi's order. So in this way His social position was very favorable. Personal position was very favorable. Still, He took //sannyāsa,// left home. Why? //Dayitaye:// in order to favor, in order to show mercy to the fallen souls of the world.

So He left a legacy that anyone who has taken birth in India,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

So He exhibited personally how to do //para-upakāra,// welfare to others, fallen souls. So this //sannyāsa// means following the order of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that,

> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tara' ei deśa
> yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

So not only... We are trying to create a position that not only the Indians have got this responsibility, but according to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, anyone---//pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]---they should take up this missionary work. And I am so much obliged to you, you American boys and girls also, that you have taken this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement very seriously. And by the grace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu you are taking //sannyāsa,// some of you. Keep it very perfectly and go from town to town, city to city, village to village, all over the world and spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement so that everyone will be happy. People are very much suffering. They, because they are //mūḍhas,// rascals, they do not know how to adjust living condition in human form. This is the //bhāgavata-dharma// everywhere. So the human form is not to become a dog, hog, pig. You should become a perfect human being. //Śuddhyet sattva.// Purify your existence. Why you are subjected to birth, death, old age and disease? Because we are impure. Now, if we purify our existence, then there will be no such thing as birth, death, old age and disease. That is the version of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Kṛṣṇa Himself. Simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa, you become purified and you escape the contamination of birth, death, old age and disease.

So try to convince the people in general, the philosophers, the religionists. We have no such thing, sectarian view. Anyone can join this movement and become purified himself. //Janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]. So I am very much pleased. You have given already service to the society. Now you take up //sannyāsa// and preach all over the world so that people may be benefited.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda!

**Prabhupāda:**
The //daṇḍa.// Take this and offer obeisances. So add to your name "Swami," that's all. What is his name?

**Devotee:**
Viraha.

**Prabhupāda:**
Viraha. Viraha Prakāśa Swami. Bow down. Viraha Prakāśa. Caitanya Mahāprabhu is the symbolic of //viraha prakāśa. Govinda-viraheṇa me.// He says, //śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me// [Śikṣāṣṭaka]. That is //viraha-prakāśa,// that "Everything is vacant for me without Govinda." That is called //viraha.// So we should be mad after Govinda. That is //govinda-viraheṇa me. Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.// Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I can go you can proceed.
