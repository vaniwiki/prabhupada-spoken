> evaṁ surādayaḥ sarve

Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, if He is pleased upon somebody, nobody can annihilate him. Similarly, if He is angry upon somebody, nobody can protect him. There is a Bengali, //payara//[?], //rākhe kṛṣṇa māre ke, māre kṛṣṇa rākhe ke.// If Kṛṣṇa wants to kill somebody... Kṛṣṇa does not kill, neither the living entity is ever killed. Just like father. If he chastises his son, it is not chastisement; it is favor. The devotees can understand that even sometimes we meet very reverse condition of life, it is also favor. //Tat te 'nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇaḥ// [SB 10.14.8]. Anyone who can see that this unfavorable condition of life is also another favor of Kṛṣṇa... //Tat te 'nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇaḥ.// "Even there is some suffering, it is not given by Kṛṣṇa. I am suffering on account of my past misdeeds, and Kṛṣṇa is so kind that I would have suffered many hundred thousand times more than the present suffering, but Kṛṣṇa is adjusting the whole thing by little suffering." This is the vision of devotee. //Tat te 'nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇo bhuñjana evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam. Ātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam.// A devotee never accuses Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa, I am serving You so nicely, and You are giving me so much suffering." No. This is not devotee's view. Devotee will take that "This so-called suffering is also Kṛṣṇa's favor." //Tat te 'nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇaḥ.// So those who are going forward with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they should not be, I mean, a debtor to any condition of life.

So //surādayaḥ. Surādayaḥ// means demigods headed by Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva. //Yaṁ brahmā-varuṇendra-rudra stunvanti divyaiḥ stavaiḥ.// The Supreme Personality of Godhead is worshiped even by Brahma. //Yaṁ brahmā-varuṇendra:// Indra, Varuna and Indra... There are big, big stalwart demigods. They also offer their respect. They think themselves as subordinate, humble servants of Kṛṣṇa. //Śiva-viriñci-nutam// [SB 11.5.33]. Kṛṣṇa is offered obeisances even by demigods like Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā. //Śiva-viriñci-nutam.//

> yaṁ brahmā-varuṇendra-rudra stunvanti divyaiḥ stavair
> vedaiḥ sāṅga-pada-kramopaniṣadair gāyanti yaṁ sāma-gāḥ
> dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yogino
> yasyāntaṁ na viduḥ surāsura-gaṇā devāya tasmai namaḥ
> [SB 12.13.1]

So the anger is there, Kṛṣṇa, but His anger is worshiped. And our anger is different. That is the distinction between spirit and matter. So here, //surādayaḥ sarve brahma-rudra-puraḥ sarāḥ na upaitum aśakan manyu.// There is anger. Kṛṣṇa, to kill Hiraṇyakaśipu, He became so angry that even big, big stalwart demigods, //brahmādaya...// Because demigods... The list of demigods begins from Lord Brahmā. He is the original father of the demigods and all other living entities. He's therefore known as //prajā-pati// or called //pitā-maha,// grandfather, //prajā-pati.// He is the origin of everything. The Darwin's theory, a rascal theory, that there was no life, but according to Vedic knowledge there were the best life: Brahmā. From there begins life, and gradually they become degraded, material contamination. Not that there was no life; from low type of living condition one is elevated higher and higher. That is a wrong theory. The real theory is that life begins from the most exalted person, Lord Brahmā, //prajā-pati.// So in any auspicious matter they are forward, because you cannot approach God in your lower condition of life. Hmm? Lower condition of life means sinful reaction. In that condition you cannot approach God. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. [aside:] Who is talking? //Pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.// Kṛṣṇa is the supreme pure, //pavitraṁ paramam. Paramam// means "extreme." So nobody can approach Kṛṣṇa while he is impure. That is not possible. Just like some rascals, they say, "It doesn't matter what you are eating, what you are doing. There is no hindrance for your spiritual advancement." These rascals, these fools, misleading the whole world that in the matter of understanding the Supreme Person one can behave like the low-grade persons. No. That is not possible. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]].

So if you have to approach the supreme pure, you have to become pure. Otherwise there is no possibility. Without being fire, you cannot enter into the fire. Then you'll be burned. Similarly, although you are also Brahman... Part of Para-brahman is also Brahman. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// This is our identification. But what kind of Brahman? But minute particle of Brahman, small particle. Just like spark and the whole fire: both of them are fire, but spark is spark, and the big fire is big fire. So the spark cannot become big fire. If he wants to become so, then he falls down. Then whatever little light was there, fire, it becomes extinguished. If the spark out of impudency wants to try to become the big fire, then he falls down. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa,// by severe austerities and penances, you can rise up to the impersonal Brahman, but you'll fall down again. That is the fact. So many persons, they are trying to become merged into the existence of the Supreme Brahman, but the result is they are falling down. They must fall down. It is not possible. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho anādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. Without taking care to worship the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, they are falling down. So we should be very, very careful not to try to become equal or greater than Kṛṣṇa. There are some rascals, they say that "Such and such rascal is greater than Kṛṣṇa." I do not wish to mention their name. That rascals, they say that "Aurobindo is greater than Kṛṣṇa." They say like that. Do you know that? So this, the world, is full of rascals and fools. We have to... Very cautiously and intelligently we have to make progress in spiritual life. Don't take it very insignificantly or.. We should be very much careful. Otherwise there is falldown, and once falldown means a gap of millions of years. You have got this human form of life to complete Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but if you are not serious, then again the gap will be millions of years.

Therefore our duty is //tāṅdera caraṇa sevi, bhakta-sane vās.// We should live with the devotees and be engaged in the service of the //ācāryas. Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit// [SB 11.17.27]. One should understand //ācārya// as Kṛṣṇa Himself. Don't disregard him. //Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau// [//ŚU// 6.23]. These are the statement. So we must be very cautious. Just like here also, the //brahmādaya,// big, big demigods, they could not pacify, appease the Lord. He was angry. //Evaṁ surādayaḥ sarve brahma-rudra-puraḥ sarāḥ.// Big, big personalities, //rudra, na upaitum. Na upaitum aśakan manyu.// They could not pacify Him, and //saṁrambhaṁ sudurāsadam. Sudurāsadam:// very, very difficult. Once we are condemned by Kṛṣṇa, it is very, very difficult to rise up again. //Mūḍhā janmani janmani// [[books:bg:16:20|[Bg. 16.20]]]. Life after life we shall be condemned. That is our punishment. So don't do anything which will make Kṛṣṇa unhappy. Simply engage yourself in the service of the Lord. Very simple thing. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Simply always think of Him. Do not think anyone..., anything else. //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. Just try to maintain your service for Kṛṣṇa. There is twenty-four-hours' engagement, and try to follow it. Do not neglect it. That will make your life successful.

Thank you very much.
