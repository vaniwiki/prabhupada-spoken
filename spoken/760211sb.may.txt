Translation: "O King Yudhiṣṭhira, Prahlāda Mahārāja, the exalted devotee, although a little boy, accepted the words of Lord Brahmā and gradually proceeded towards Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva and immediately fell down to offer his respectful obeisances with folded hands."

**Prabhupāda:**

> tatheti śanakai rājan
> mahā-bhāgavato 'rbhakaḥ
> upetya bhuvi kāyena
> nanāma vidhṛtāñjaliḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:4|[SB 7.9.4]]]

So Prahlāda Mahārāja, //mahā-bhāgavata, uttama-adhikārī.// There are three stages of devotional platform. First stage is called //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,// second stage is called //madhyama-adhikārī,// and third stage, or topmost stage, is called //uttama-adhikārī.// So he was only five years old. How he became //uttama-adhikārī,// on the topmost stage? He had no training. Still, he is addressed here by Narada Muni---Narada Muni was his //guru//---and still, he is describing Prahlāda Mahārāja as //mahā-bhāgavata.// That means even one is //mahā-bhāgavata,// he has to accept a //guru.// Narada Muni, he is //guru;// he knows that "Prahlāda is my disciple, but he is //mahā-bhāgavata.//" Not only that, before his birth, when he was within the womb of his mother... His mother was attacked by the demigods, headed by Indra, and they were dragging her to their palace. Narada Muni met, said, "What are you doing this? You are harassing one woman?" "No, sir, we are not harassing, only we are taking her in our place to wait for the deliverance of the child. Then we shall kill him. Because he is born of atheist father, so he is another demon." Narada Muni said, "No, no, no. You are mistaken. He is not demon, he is //mahā-bhāgavata.//"

So in the beginning he was //mahā-bhāgavata,// since he was in within the womb of his mother. And later on he is //mahā-bhāgavata.// This is called //nitya-siddha,// eternally //mahā-bhāgavata.// Eternally //mahā-bhāgavata// never forgets Kṛṣṇa, in any circumstance. That is the sign of //mahā-bhāgavata, nitya-siddha.// Prahlāda Mahārāja was put into so many trials when he was only a child, still he never forgot Kṛṣṇa. That is the sign of //mahā-bhāgavata.// In any circumstances. It does not mean that because one is //mahā-bhāgavata// he should not be put into trials. He can be put into trials, because the material world is like that. The Western country, they, Lord Jesus Christ, he was put into trials but he never forgot Kṛṣṇa. This is sign of //mahā-bhāgavata, nitya-siddha.//

> gaurāṅgera saṅgi-gaṇe nitya-siddha kori 'māne
> se jāy brajenda-nandana pāś

If one can understand //nitya-siddha bhāgavata,// then he immediately becomes eligible to go back to home, to back to Godhead. This is the privilege of associating with //mahā-bhāgavata.//

So our system is... [child crying] [aside:] Try and maintain[?]. //Evaṁ paramparā,// to associate with the //mahā-bhāgavata// by words or by physical exposition. So //mahā-bhāgavata, arbhakaḥ.// One may argue, //arbhakaḥ// means foolish child who has no knowledge, he is called //arbhakaḥ.// How we can say //mahā-bhāgavata, arbhakaḥ,// he has no knowledge? No. It is possible. //Ahaituky apratihatā. Bhakti// does not depend on age or on advanced knowledge, or richness, or so many other things---//janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]], to take birth in high family, aristocracy, and to become rich, to become beautiful, to become very learned scholar. These things are material assets, but spiritual life does not depend on these things. One can become spiritually very advanced even though he is poor, he is born in a low..., low-grade family. Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura. He was born in Muhammadan family, but //mahā-bhāgavata.// There are so many examples. Not that because he was born in a Muhammadan family, therefore he cannot. This Marchoism[?] is like that, but actually it is not. //Ahaituky apratihatā. Bhakti// is so purifying that any condition, any circumstances, one can become devotee.

> māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]

Kṛṣṇa says.

So everyone has got the potency to become //mahā-bhāgavata,// provided he tries. //Sādhana-siddha// and //nitya-siddha.// So Prahlāda Mahārāja is //nitya-siddha,// and there are //sādhana-siddhas,// just like we are. We are trying to approach the topmost goal of life by //bhajana,// by //sādhana.// So anyone has got the potency to come to the stage of //mahā-bhāgavata,// provided he follows the //mahājana.// You can become //mahā-bhāgavata// if you follow //mahājana. Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. If you follow the //mahājana's// path then everyone can become. Of course, it is not possible everyone to become //mahā-bhāgavata,// but there is possibility. Simply we have to become serious to follow the path of //mahājana. Dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyāṁ mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. //Tarko apratiṣṭhaḥ.// Simply by argument, you cannot make advancement. Simply by //neti neti,// or there are many other processes, mystic //yoga// process to become very austere, remain silent, //mauna-vrata śruta-tapa, tapasya,// education, austerity... None of them are the cause but becoming //bhakta,// only devotional service, if one is fixed up, //dṛḍha-vratāḥ. Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritaḥ bhajanty, dṛḍha-vratāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. So we should be very much firmly fixed up, following the rules and regulation.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja, he is //nitya-siddha. Nitya-siddha// means there are living entities, every living entity is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So one who does not fall down, he is called //nitya-siddha.// One who does not fall down. Just like in this material world there are millions and millions of living entities, but they have fallen down. But there are multi-millions and millions of living entities in the //vaikuṇṭha-loka,// they never fall down. They are called //nitya-siddha.// They never come here. So we have no information. This is only one-fourth manifestation of God's creation, and the three-fourths creation of God is there. Not creation; it is everlasting. Just like in the prison house, if you go to the prison house, it does not mean that the whole state is there. It is only insignificant part of the state, and only the criminals they are put together.

So this material world... Material world means so many planets you see---so many stars and planets: the sun planet, moon planet and //loka, sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. This is one universe, and there are millions of universes. Altogether that is material world, and that is one part of creation. //Ekāṁśena sthito jagat// [[books:bg:10:42|[Bg. 10.42]]]. The //jagat// means this material world. So the whole material, //ananta koṭi. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣv aśeṣa vasudhādi vibhūti-bhinnam// [Bs. 5.40]. This //ananta-koṭi-brahmāṇḍa// is only one-fourth manifestation of God's creation, and just imagine what is the other three-fourth. That is spiritual world.

So the //nitya-siddha mahā-bhāgavata,// they come from the spiritual world on the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and they, by example, they preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is //mahā-bhāgavata.// By suffering, by example, everything, they look like ordinary men, but //mahā-bhāgavata.// How it is tested? Never forgets Kṛṣṇa. This is //mahā-bhāgavata nitya-siddha.// And //sādhana-siddha// means those who are put into this material world, by the association of //mahā-bhāgavata,// if he tries, follows, then he can also become //mahā-bhāgavata// or //nitya-siddha,// because originally everyone is //nitya-siddha.//

> nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti 'sādhya' kabhu naya
> śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:107|[Cc. Madhya 22.107]]]

Every living entity originally //nitya-siddha,// but somehow or other, just like Jaya-Vijaya fell down in this material world, and he was delivered also, both of them were delivered. So although you have fallen in this material world and suffering the pangs of material existence, //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]], on account of accepting this material body, still, Kṛṣṇa personally comes, //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. This is //glāniḥ,// discrepancies. We are living this material existence. This is not real life. Real life is to become //mahā-bhāgavata.//

So you cannot become a //mahā-bhāgavata// all of a sudden, but from //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,//

> arcāyām eva haraye
> yaḥ pūjāṁ śraddhayehate
> na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu
> sa bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ
> [SB 11.2.47]

//Prākṛtaḥ// stage. So //prakṛtaḥ// stage means just like we are worshiping the Deity, but not only we shall worship Deity, but we make advancement. What is that advancement? To become gradually a preacher. That is //madhyama-adhikārī,// second stage: preacher. Preacher means that,

> īśvare tad-adhīneṣu
> bāliśeṣu dviṣatsu ca
> prema-maitrī-kṛpā upekṣāḥ
> yaḥ karoti sa madhyamaḥ
> [SB 11.2.46]

When you become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious by worshiping the Deity regularly, as we have got prescription to rise early in the morning, offer //maṅgala-ārati,// then //kīrtana,// then class, in this way practicing, practicing, when you become advanced Kṛṣṇa conscious, then your natural tendency will be how to preach. So long you do not develop this tendency for preaching, simply remain in //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,// you do not know how to deliver others. //Na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu.// You do not know how to receive elevated..., one elevated devotee; you do not know how to do good to others.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is not to keep one in the //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,// especially those who are born in India. He says,

> bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This is principle, //para-upakāra.// Because everyone is suffering. So in the lower stage, everyone should take part very diligently in the worship of the Deity, //śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-sṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārj anādau.// One should be engaged..., everyone should be engaged, //śrī-vigrahārādhanam,// with Deity worship. What is that Deity worship? //Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra,// to decorate the Deity very, very nicely, //śṛṅgāra. Tan-mandira-mārjanādau,// and to keep the temple, all through, very clean. This //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī// should be fully engaged in these things, then he becomes gradually, I mean to say, elevated in the //madhyama-adhikārī.//

In the //madhyama-adhikārī// he can see four things. What is that? Four things means first of all the Supreme Lord, //īśvara,// the controller, he can see. "He can see" means he understands, he appreciates, he can conceive, "Yes, the Supreme Lord is there". There is no more theoretical. So //īśvara.// And //tad-adhīneṣu,// and persons who have become devotee, he can understand, "Here is a devotee." //Īśvare tad-adhīneṣu bāliśeṣu. Bāliśa// means innocent person. They do not know what is God, what is to be done. They are called //bāliśa.// Just like children, //arbhakaḥ, bāliśa.// And then //dviṣāt,// envious. Just like you have experienced so many rascals, as soon as they hear of God, immediately they become agitated. They are called //dviṣāt,// envious, demons. So four things: God, His devotees, and the innocent person and the demonic atheist. He can see, //madhyama-adhikārī.// And then he behaves with these four classes of men differently. What is that? //Prema// for Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord---how to increase love. That is first business, //prema.// And those who are devotees, to make friendship with them---//maitrī.// Those who are higher than him, he should offer very respectful obeisances; those who are equal, treat them with nicely; and those who are lower, then instruct them, //bāliśeṣu;// those who are innocent, how to raise him in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is preaching. And //dviṣatsu, upekṣaḥ,// those who are atheist, don't associate with them. Don't associate with them. That is the //madhyama-adhikārī.//

And //uttama-adhikārī,// that is very rarely attained, this stage. //Uttama-adhikārī// has only equal one vision, //samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. The //uttama-adhikārī,// he does not think that "He is envious," or "He is this" or "He is that." He sees that everyone is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is not to be imitated. That Prahlāda Mahārāja is like that. He did not know who is his enemy and who is friend. No, he did not know. He is //uttama-adhikārī, mahā-bhāgavata.//

So this //mahā-bhāgavata,// this word is very important in this verse, //mahā-bhāgavato 'rbhakaḥ.// Immediately, as soon as Brahmā requested, "My dear boy, please pacify," no hesitation, immediately, immediately he fell down. //Upetya bhuvi kāyena.// He is always at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, and, as a child, immediately as Brahmā said, immediately he did. //Kāyena upetya nanāma,// as it is. He was not to be lesson, that "You meant like this, fall down this." No. He knows, everything. Life after life he is doing that. //Gaurāṅgera saṅgi-gaṇe, nitya-siddha kori māne.// Whenever there is Kṛṣṇa's incarnation... Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu: as soon as He advented Himself, immediately there was Advaitācārya, Nityānanda and other, many, many devotees. They are //guarāṅgera saṅgi.// They are not //sādhana-bhakti;// they are eternally associate. So similarly, Prahlāda Mahārāja is also eternally associate. Whenever there is need, by the order of Kṛṣṇa, he is present there to execute the order of Kṛṣṇa. This is our position: eternal servant.

We should not become servant to make some material profit. He is not; he is not //śuddha-bhakta. Sa vai vaṇik,// Prahlāda Mahārāja. So anyone who serves Kṛṣṇa for some material benefit, //sa vai vaṇik.// Material benefit means, that //śāstra,// Kṛṣṇa says that //patraṁ puspaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. So many person comes in the temple for some material benefit. They surrender to the saintly person for some material benefit: "Give me //āśīrbād,// benediction." "What benediction?" "I have got ten thousand rupees. Make it one //lakh// by your benediction." So these kind of devotees have been described by Prahlāda Mahārāja as //vaṇik, vaṇīya,// mercantile. Therefore merchant people, they want to invest two rupees and make..., want to make profit ten rupees. So offering Kṛṣṇa little flower and fruit, they want to get some horses and elephants, you see, or very big estate. This is not devotion. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. Our position is eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa's position is eternal master. //Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. He is the enjoyer. He is the proprietor. That is eternally: He is master, and we are eternally servant. If you keep this position, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So //mahā-bhāgavata,// they know always; they never forget this position. And those who are fallen souls, conditioned souls, they do not know it, so they have to be raised to that stage. That stage how? So he is also //nitya-siddha. Nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti. Kṛṣṇa-bhakti,// as soon as one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious fully, he becomes //nitya-siddha// again. So either you come by //sādhana-bhakti// or naturally, the..., when you come to the ultimate stage, everyone is //nitya-siddha.// So //nitya-siddha,// those who come from Vaikuṇṭha, they are never fallen, never forgets Kṛṣṇa, that is //nitya-siddha,// and by the teachings of //nitya-siddha mahā-bhāgavata,// if one follows and then becomes by //sādhana-siddha,// by regulative principle, they also become //nitya-siddha// later on. And when one becomes //nitya-siddha// again, there is no difference between this living entity and that living entity. //Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.//

So,

> tatheti śanakai rājan
> mahā-bhāgavato 'rbhakaḥ
> upetya bhuvi kāyena
> nanāma vidhṛtāñjaliḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:4|[SB 7.9.4]]]

If you simply learn from Prahlāda Mahārāja, simply offer your obeisances, as under the instruction of Brahmā, if you follow the //guru...// Brahmā is the //guru, guru//'s //guru.// Prahlāda Mahārāja's //guru// was Narada, and his //guru// was Brahmā. So our //sampradāya// is Brahmā, Brahma- sampradāya. There are four //sampradāyas.// We belong to this Brahma-sampradāya. So //sampradāya-vihīnā ye mantrās te niṣphalā// [Padma Purāṇa]. We have to accept one //sampradāya, paramparā,// and if we follow, just like Prahlāda Mahārāja, exactly under the order of Brahmā and Narada, immediately fell down, so everyone can do it. Here is Kṛṣṇa. So everyone, if he follows //mahājana...// Brahmā is the first //mahājana. Svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ// [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]. Brahmā, his another name is Svayambhū. These are //mahājanas. Svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ,// Kapila, Manu, Prahlāda. Prahlāda is also //mahājana.// Prahlāda, Janaka, Bhīṣma, //bali vaiyāsakiḥ vayam.// So Prahlāda Mahārāja is //mahājana.// He is //mahā-bhāgavata.// Don't think that he is a little boy. That is his pastime to show us how a little boy can become //mahā-bhāgavata,// how a little boy can be the eternal associate of Kṛṣṇa, and how he can preach. That is Prahlāda Mahārāja.

Thank you very very much. [end]
