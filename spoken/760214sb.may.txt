====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.9.7 ======

**Śāstrījī:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [chants verse, with Prabhupāda and devotees repeating]

**Dayānanda:**
[chants synonyms; devotees chant responsively]

> astauṣīd dharim ekāgra-
> manasā susamāhitaḥ
> prema-gadgadayā vācā
> tan-nyasta-hṛdayekṣanaḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:7|[SB 7.9.7]]]

[01:52]

Translation: "Prahlāda Mahārāja thus fixed up in his mind with full attention; the mind and sight, everything was placed in complete trance. Thus, on account of love, he began to offer his prayer in faltering voice."

**Prabhupāda:**

> astauṣīd dharim ekāgra-
> manasā susamāhitaḥ
> prema-gadgadayā vācā
> tan-nyasta-hṛdayekṣanaḥ
> [[books:sb:7:9:7|[SB 7.9.7]]]

So this is gradual progress of spiritual mind, and this state is called //prema, prema-gadgadayā.// So we have to make progress as it is exemplified by Prahlāda Mahārāja. //Ādau gurv-āśrayam sad-dharma-pṛcchā sādhu-mārga-anugamanam.// [aside:] Stop that. The first business is //ādau,// in the beginning, //gurv-āśrayam. Gurv-āśrayam// means to take shelter of a bona fide spiritual master, //ādau gurv-āśrayam,// and this takes place when there is //śraddhā.// Just like in this meeting, persons who have got little faith, they can sit down and hear. This is called //śraddhā.// And the higher stage of //śraddhā// is to completely accept the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// that is highest state of //śraddhā.// In the lower stage, little faith, "So here is something going on about Kṛṣṇa, let us sit down and hear it," this is //kaniṣṭha-śraddhā.// And this //śraddhā,// faith, has to be increased. That ultimately, in the mature stage of //śraddhā,// faith, that is described in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,//

> śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya
> kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]]

This is //śraddhā. Śraddha-śabde,// this //śraddhā,// faith, means //sudṛḍha niścaya, śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa.// Kṛṣṇa says,

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi...
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

This is called faith. Yes, Kṛṣṇa says that simply by surrendering at His lotus feet one becomes immediately a liberated person. Kṛṣṇa says that.

> sarva-dharmān parityajya
> mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja
> ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo
> mokṣayiṣyāmi
> [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]

Just like if I offer you that if you do this work, I shall give you immediately fifty thousand rupees. So who will believe me? "This man is a beggar, //sannyāsī,// how he'll give fifty thousand rupees?" So there is no //śraddhā.// But we cannot do so with reference to Kṛṣṇa. When Kṛṣṇa says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi,// that is a fact. That is not a bogus promise. Because Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all-powerful, whatever He likes, He can do. This is called faith.

So after reading //Bhagavad-gītā,// if one does not get this faith in Kṛṣṇa, then it is useless waste of time. That's all. There are many so-called scholars, politicians, they declare that "I read //Bhagavad-gītā// daily, three times," but the result is no faith in Kṛṣṇa. This is called useless waste of time. If you do not get the faith which is required by studying //Bhagavad... Bhagavad-gītā// is the ABCD reading for understanding God. That is ABC. So if you do not understand even the ABCD, how he'll advance in higher studies? That is not possible. So even we cannot understand //Bhagavad-gītā,// the ABCD, Kṛṣṇa says one thing, and they make, I mean to say, interpretation in a different way. Kṛṣṇa says, //aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]], //mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.// They do not believe it. //Śrama eva hi kevalam.// To such persons the //Bhāgavata// says,

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed yadi ratiṁ
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

You, you are very religious, performing the ritualistic ceremony very nicely, going to the Ganges and taking your bath, and //dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ.// Very rightly you are executing your religious principle, and coming at home, you are reading //Bhagavad-gītā//---but you have no faith in Kṛṣṇa. That is useless time, useless waste of time. The //Bhāgavata, śrama eva hi kevalam.// So this..., why this happens? Because these people do not approach the right person, //guru. Ādau gurv-āśrayam.//

Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was visited by many learned //brāhmaṇas// when He was at Purī, Jagannātha Purī. So one learned //brāhmaṇa,// he wrote some poems about Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. There were many //brāhmaṇas,// they were coming, but all such reading matter, first it was to be tested by His secretary, Svarūpa Dāmodara. If Svarūpa Dāmodara would pass, then Caitanya Mahāprabhu will hear. Otherwise, why should He waste His time some hodge-podge writing? So one //brāhmaṇa,// he wrote something about Caitanya Mahāprabhu and came to read, recite, before Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and Svarūpa Dāmodara found many mistakes in that poem, so he did not allow him, that "You do not know how to present theistic literature. You don't... You cannot see Caitanya Mahāprabhu." He chastised him about the mistake.

So to write theistic literature is not to be done by any ordinary man. It is not to, because they, they do not know. So we should not read any literature which is not presented by a bona fide Vaiṣṇava. It has been forbidden by Sanātana Goswāmī.

> avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ
> pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtaṁ
> śravaṇaṁ naiva kartavyam...
> [Hari-bhakti-vilāsa]

He said. Sanātana Goswāmī is our guide, //ācārya.// He is warning you that "If a person is not Vaiṣṇava, don't hear anything nonsense from him." That is the injunction. Don't hear. This is very rigidly to be followed.

> avaiṣṇava-mukhodgīrṇaṁ
> pūtaṁ hari-kathāmṛtaṁ
> śravaṇaṁ na kartavyaṁ
> sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payaḥ yathā
> [Hari-bhakti-vilāsa]

One can argue, "No, we can hear //hari-kathā// from any person, he may be Vaiṣṇava or not Vaiṣṇava. What is the matter?" But Sanātana Goswāmī, "No." So why it is "no"? Because it is like //sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payaḥ yathā.// Milk is very good, nice food, everyone knows, but if the milk is touched by the lips of a snake, it is not to be touched. It is not to be touched. It has become poison. Very good example. Similarly, if we do not hear from the right person any Vedic literature, especially //Bhagavad-gītā,// because that is the beginning, the //sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payaḥ yathā.// He may be very big scholar, but because he is //avaiṣṇava,// not devotee, it has become poison. In our country we have got so many editions---not only in country, in all, outside the country also, in your country. There are so many hodge-podge interpretation of //Bhagavad-gītā,// and they are being read and being used for the last two hundred years ago, but there was no effective result. It could not act. But as soon as this //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// we have presented and you are reading, so many thousands of thousands, they are becoming devotee.

So therefore, this process Prahlāda Mahārāja is demonstrating by his personal behavior because he is //mahājana.// He is //mahājana.// Out of the twelve //mahājanas...// The //śāstra// says, //mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]: one has to follow the //mahājana,// authorized person. //Mahājana// means authorized person. Ordinary //jana,// common man; and //mahājana// means authorized person. We cannot take lessons, instruction, from unauthorized person. This authorization must come through the disciplic succession. If the spiritual master, authorized spiritual master, says, "You do this," that we have to do. That we are singing daily:

> guru-mukha-padma-vākya cittete koriyā-aikya
> āra nā koriho mane āśā

This is the process. This is the process. And if I think that I am more intelligent than my //guru...// First of all //guru// must be bona fide, not a bogus //guru.// The //guru,// as specified by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that is not very difficult, who is //guru.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,

> yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa
> āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa
> [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]

He is //guru.// One who is strictly following the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and after following Him, he is just delivering the instruction as Kṛṣṇa has said, then you become //guru.// It is not difficult. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has ordered everyone. Therefore our process is to follow Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and then try to understand Kṛṣṇa's instruction.

Just like here in our temple: first of all there is Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Through His mercy we are trying to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. You cannot understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa directly. That is not possible. That will be like that //sarpocchiṣṭaṁ payaḥ yathā,// milk touched by the lips of a snake. There are so many //Bhāgavata// reciters in India, they jump over to the //rasa-līlā// without understanding Kṛṣṇa through Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has sung... You know?

> rūpa-raghunātha-pade hoibe ākuti
> kabe hāma bujhabo se jugala-pīriti

Don't try to understand //jugala-pīriti,// Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa's love, abruptly. It is foolishness. You will misunderstand. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, he said, //rūpa-raghunātha-pade hoibe ākuti.// Rūpa, beginning from Rūpa Gosvāmī up to Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī, six Gosvāmīs, Śrī-Rūpa, Sanātana, Bhaṭṭa-Raghunātha, Śrī-Jīva, Gopāla-bhatta, Dāsa-Raghunātha, six Gosvāmīs. So Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, //rūpa-raghunātha,// beginning from Rūpa to Raghunātha dāsa. //Rūpa-raghunātha-pade hoibe ākuti kabe hāma bujhabo:// don't try to understand Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa love without going through the instruction of Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, Dāsa Gosvāmī, like. That is the instruction.

So we see practically how Prahlāda Mahārāja immediately attained the state of //prema.// Here it is said, //prema-gadgadayā vaca. Prema,// that //prema// is not this //prema.// The lusty desire, that is not //prema. Prema,// one has to learn; one has to go through the disciplic or discipline to attain the stage of //prema.// As Prahlāda Mahārāja, so he first of all followed the instruction of Brahmā, then immediately he got the favor of Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva, and after getting that, he got the //prema// stage. You cannot go immediately to the //prema// stage. That is also //rūpa-raghunātha-pade. Rūpa-raghunātha,// Rūpa Goswāmī has said [indistinct],

> ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-
> saṅgaḥ atha bhajana-kriyā
> tato anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt
> tato niṣṭhā tataḥ ruciḥ
> athāsaktis tato bhāvas
> sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ
> prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ
> [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]]]

These are the //kramaḥ.// You cannot get //prema// state artificially, crying, falling down and then smoking //bidi.// This is not //prema. Prema// you have to learn by the //kramaḥ pantha.// That //kramaḥ pantha// is the same: //ādau śraddhā. Ādau śraddhā. Śraddha// means faith: "Yes, Kṛṣṇa says that, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. It is right." This is faith. This is beginning of faith.

Now, to keep the faith or to increase the faith, you have to live with faithful servants of Kṛṣṇa. With our this institution, the center is meant for giving a chance to the common people to get association of devotee. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14]]]. //Sādhu// means those who are well behaved in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not upstarts. They are called //sādhu.// So those who are living in this temple, they must be strictly very well behaved, so that whoever may come out of //śraddhā,// if he sits down for some time and sees your behavior, then he'll be influenced. And if you become third class, then how //sādhu-saṅgaḥ// will be effective? No. You must strictly follow the regulative principles as given to you by your spiritual master, //śāstra.// You must follow. Then people will come in contact with you, they will be benefited. //Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:23:14-15|[Cc. Madhya 23.14]]]. And if he regularly makes //sādhu-saṅgaḥ,// then the effect will be he will try to become a //sādhu.// That is initiation. Initiation means the beginning of becoming a //sādhu,// not that after initiation immediately he becomes a //sādhu.// No. If he follows, just like we instruct that you chant at least sixteen rounds, you have no illicit sex, you cannot take any meat, fish, eggs, or you cannot have any intoxication up to drinking tea and smoking, and we say no gambling---this is the process of becoming a //sādhu.// So //ādau śraddhā.// This is called //bhajana-kriyā.//

Then //anartha-nivṛttiḥ. Anartha.// These are //anartha.// There is no need of smoking---it is useless---but we have practiced it. Therefore they are //anartha.// But if you follow the devotional process, then //anartha// will be finished very soon. That is the test. Test means //bhakti pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]: if you are actually advancing in //bhakti,// devotional service, then automatically you don't like these nonsense practices: no illicit sex, no meat eating, no gambling, no intoxication. Automatically. That is the test how far you are. //Anartha-nivṛtti syāt.// These are //anartha.// Then it is //niṣṭhā,// firm faith; then //ruci,// taste; then //asakti,// attraction; then //bhava;// then //prema.// So Prahlāda Mahārāja, he is on the stage of //prema, prema-gadgadayā vācā tan-nyasta-hṛdayekṣaṇaḥ.// When you attain the stage of //prema,// then your core of heart is cleansed for welcoming. He is there, for seeing.

Therefore in the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is said, //premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. You can see God within your heart. He is sitting there, //īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. You get ready, Kṛṣṇa is there within your heart. But you cannot see because you have no //prema.// You cannot see. Kṛṣṇa does not expose Himself to the nondevotees. He does not. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. He'll not expose Himself. But if you attain the stage of //prema,// as Prahlāda Mahārāja attained, then you will see Him. How you will see? //Sadaiva:// always. Not that for two minutes I see and Kṛṣṇa is no more there. No, not like that. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva. Sadaiva// means constant, incessantly. You can see.

> premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena
> santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti
> yaṁ śyāmasundaram acintya-guṇa-svarūpaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.38]

Then you can offer your prayers to Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, and then your life is successful. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness process.

So try to follow the path chalked out by Prahlāda Mahārāja. He is one of the //mahājanas.// Out of the twelve //mahājanas,// he is also one of them. He is our //guru.// So try to follow Prahlāda Mahārāja's instruction and behavior also. Just see his behavior, how he attained the stage of //prema// gradually. So you should be ambitious. Our goal of life, that is the Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, //prema pum-artho mahān// [//Caitanya-mañjuṣā//]. He doesn't say, //dharmārtha-kāma-mokṣa// [[books:sb:4:8:41|[SB 4.8.41]]]. He never says. To become religious, that is not; but that is the beginning, because without religion, everyone is animal, cats and dog. So religion is the beginning, //dharma, artha,// but generally... [break] [end]
