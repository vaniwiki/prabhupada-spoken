====== Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Appearance Day Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[leads chanting of //Cc. Ādi// 1.1 responsively] //...īśa-bhaktān īśam īśāvatārakān tat-prakāśāṁś ca tac-chaktīḥ kṛṣṇa-caitanya-devam.// [aside---referring to microphone:] It will not stay. It will not stay. Today, the auspicious day of our predecessor spiritual master, Oṁ Viṣṇupāda Paramahaṁsa Parivrājakācārya Aṣṭottara-śata Śrīmad Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda. Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura's mission... Apart from his life, we are especially stressing on the mission of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. This place, Māyāpur, was formerly known as Miyapura. Mostly it is inhabited by the Muhammadans. Some way or other it converted into the name of Miyapura instead of Māyāpur. Still, people are very much doubtful where is the birth site of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was researching to find out the actual place. So under the direction of Jagannātha dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja, this present //Yogapīṭha// was ascertained to be the birth site of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura in the beginning wanted to develop this place very gloriously, befitting the holy name of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So he started this movement of developing Māyāpur. He could not finish it, so it was handed down to Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. So under his effort, assisted by his disciples, this place has gradually developed, and our attempt is also to develop this place. Therefore we have named this temple Māyāpur Chandrodaya. We have got great ambition to develop this place nicely and gloriously, and fortunately we are now connected with foreign countries, especially with the Americans. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's great desire was that the Americans would come here and develop this place, and they would chant and dance along with the Indians.

So his dream, as well as Caitanya Mahāprabhu's foretelling,

> pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma
> sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma
> [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu desired that all Indians to take part.

> bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra.
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, //para-upakāra. Para-upakāra// means to do good to others. Of course, in the human society there are many different branches of doing good to others---welfare societies---but more or less... Why more or less? Almost completely they think that this body is our self, and to do some good to the body is welfare activities. But actually that is not welfare activities, because in the //Bhagavad-gītā// we understand very clearly, //antavanta ime dehaḥ nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ// [[books:bg:2:18|[Bg. 2.18]]]. This body is //antavat. Anta// means it will be finished. Everyone knows his body is not permanent; it will be finished. Anything material---//bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]]---it has a date of birth, it stays for some time, and then it annihilates. So the spiritual education begins from the understanding that "I am not this body." This is spiritual education. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// the first instruction given by Kṛṣṇa to Arjuna is this, that "We are not this body." Because Arjuna was speaking from the bodily platform, so Kṛṣṇa chastised him, that //aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase// [[books:bg:2:11|[Bg. 2.11]]]: "Arjuna, you are talking like a very learned man, but you are lamenting on the subject matter on which no learned man laments." //Aśocyān anvaśocas tvam.//

So such kind of welfare activity concerning the body, like hospital and so many other things, they are good undoubtedly, but the ultimate goal is to see the interest of the soul. That is ultimate goal. That is the whole Vedic instruction. And Kṛṣṇa begins from this point. //Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. So when Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted to do some //para-upakāra...//

> bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra
> manuṣya janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

These welfare activities did not mean that welfare to this body. It was meant for the soul, the same thing as Kṛṣṇa wanted to impress upon Arjuna, that "You are not this body. You are soul." //Antavanta ime dehaḥ nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. So real welfare activity means to see to the interest of the soul. So what is the interest of the soul? The interest of the soul is that the soul is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, God. Just like small spark of fire is part and parcel of the big fire, similarly, we living entities, we are very minute, small spark of the Supreme Brahman, Para-brahman, or Kṛṣṇa. So as the spark within the fire looks very beautiful---the fire also looks beautiful, and the spark also looks beautiful---but as soon as the sparks fall down from the fire, it becomes extinguished.

So our condition is that the... Our present position is that we are fallen down from the whole fire, Kṛṣṇa. This is explained in a simple Bengali language:

> kṛṣṇa bhūliyā jīva bhoga vāñchā kare
> pasate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

//Māyā// means darkness, ignorance. So this example is very nice. The sparks of the fire dancing very nicely with fire, it is also illuminating. But as soon as it fall down on the ground, it becomes cinder, black cinder, no more fiery quality. Similarly, we are meant for dancing and playing and walking and living with Kṛṣṇa. That is our real position. That is the Vṛndāvana. Everyone... Everyone is connected with Kṛṣṇa. There the trees, there the flowers, water, the cows, the calves, the cowherd boys, or elderly cowherd men, Nanda Mahārāja, other persons of his age, then Yaśodāmayī, mother, then //gopīs//---in this way Vṛndāvana life, Vṛndāvana picture. Kṛṣṇa comes with full Vṛndāvana picture, and He demonstrates His Vṛndāvana life, //cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu// [Bs. 5.29], just to attract us, that "You are trying to enjoy in this material world, but here you cannot enjoy because you are eternal. You cannot get eternal life here. So you come to Me. You come to Me." //Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. [aside:] Please ask them to wait for //prasādam. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti.// This is the invitation. //Mām eti:// "He comes back to home, back to Godhead." This is the whole instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā.// And at the end He said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. Why you are bothering yourself, manufacturing so many plans to adjust material life? That is not possible. Here it is not possible. Here, so long you are in material association, then you have to change the body. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni...// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]]. //Prakṛti-stho.// What is that verse? //Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho 'pi...//

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Bhuñjate prakṛti-jān guṇān.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha. //Bhuñjate prakṛti-jān guṇān.// So long the living entity is in this material world, he has to associate with the different modes of material nature. The same example: just like the fire spark falls down on the ground. So ground, they have got different situation. One situation is dry grass, one situation is wet grass, and one situation is simply ground. So similarly, there are three position: //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// So //sattva-guṇa// means if the spark falls down on the dry grass, then it ignites the grasses. So in the //sattva-guṇa, prakāśa,// this fiery quality is demonstrated. But if it falls down on the water, wet ground, then it is completely extinguished. Three stages. Similarly, when we come down to this material world, if we associate with the //sattva-guṇa,// then there is some, I mean, hope of spiritual life. And if we are //rajo-guṇa// there is no hope, and //tamo-guṇa,// there is no hope. //Rajas-tamaḥ. Rajas-tamo-bhāva kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. //Rajas-tamaḥ.// If we associate with //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// then our desires will be lusty and greediness. //Kāma-lobhādayaś ca. Tato rajas-tamo-bhāva kāma-lobhādayaś ca.// And if we increase our //sattva-guṇa// quality, then this //kāma-lobhādaya,// these two things, will not touch us. We may be little aloof from //kāma-lobha.//

So if in the //sattva-guṇa...// This is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ
> hṛdy antaḥ-stho hy abhadrāṇi
> vidhunoti suhṛtsatām
> [[books:sb:1:2:17|[SB 1.2.17]]]

So we have to transcend all these three qualities, //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa,// especially //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// If we do not try to do that, then there is no hope of spiritual salvation or liberation from the material entanglement. But in the Kali-yuga there is no practically //sattva-guṇa,// simply //rajas, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa,// especially //tamo-guṇa. Jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthaḥ// [[books:bg:14:18|[Bg. 14.18]]]. //Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.// Therefore Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu spread this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// So from this place Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu started this movement, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, throughout whole India, and He desired that //pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma// [CB Antya-khaṇḍa 4.126]: "So as many towns and villages are there, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should be spread."

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is now in your hand. Of course, in 1965 Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, he wanted me to do something in this connection. He wanted from his all his disciples. Especially he stressed many times that "You do this. Whatever you have learned, you try to expand in English language." And in 1933, when he was in Rādhā-kunḍa, I was at that time Bombay in connection with my business life. So I came to see him, and one friend wanted to give some land in Bombay for starting Bombay Gauḍīya Maṭha. He's my friend. So that's a long story, but I wish to narrate this, the Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī's mission. So at that time one of my Godbrother was also present. He reminded me about my friend's donation, and Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura Prabhupāda immediately took up the land. He continued that "There is no need of establishing many temples. Better we publish some books." He said like that. He said that "We started our this Gauḍīya Maṭha in Ultadanga. The rent was very, very small, and if we could gather 2 to 250 rupees, it was very nice, going on. But since this J. V. Datta[?] has given us this stone, marble stone Ṭhākurabari, our competition between the disciples have increased, so I don't like anymore. Rather, I would prefer to take out the marble stone and sell it and publish some books." So I took that point, and he also especially advised me that "If you get money, you try to publish books." So by his blessing it has become very successful by your cooperation. Now our books are being sold all over the world, and it is very satisfactory sale.

So on this particular day of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura's advent, try to remember his words, that he wanted that many books should be published about our philosophy, and it should be given to the English-knowing public especially, because English language is now world language. We are touring all over the world, so anywhere we speak English, it is understood, except in some places. So on this day, particular on the advent of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, I'd especially request my disciples who are cooperating with me that try to publish books as many as possible and distribute throughout the whole world. That will satisfy Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as well as Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura.

Thank you very much.
