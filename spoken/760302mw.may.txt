====== Morning Walk [partially recorded] ======

**Hṛdayānanda:**
There is a... There is a problem to some extent, but I don't think it should be exaggerated...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
...that you should be disturbed. It's not that everything is collapsing like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, they should be engaged in some...

**Devotee:**
How can you say the situation...?

**Prabhupāda:**
...cottage industry. Cottage industry.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And we can manufacture so many things.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
The engagement must be there.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It can be organized. The children should be raised Kṛṣṇa devotees. The woman can be engaged. Everyone can be engaged. I can give you suggestion if you can execute.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, we were thinking that it would be nice to have the cities, city centers, for the preachers, and those, for example, women, children, it's much easier to maintain them on our farms. That way they can do a little work and produce their own food and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, in the farms they can live and do some handwork.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes.

**Guru-kṛpā:**
They won't do it, though, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
They must do.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you don't allow. Don't allow that. Don't allow.

**Guru-kṛpā:**
That's good.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Maintenance is much more simple, easier, less expensive for them on a farm.

**Prabhupāda:**
If they do not follow the rules and regulations, then what is the use?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
We were thinking that unless someone is a preacher, he has no real business in the city. Let him go have a peaceful life out on the farm.

**Yaśodānandana:**
It has been seen that when many householders come together in many of our big communities, because there are so many women and children, there is a great atmosphere of laziness a lot of times. I have seen in Los Angeles and also in many other temples. But when there's a lot of //brahmacārīs// preaching, it's much more enlivening.

**Prabhupāda:**
So now you make some regulation. Otherwise... Attending class? No.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Excuse me?

**Prabhupāda:**
They attend class?

**Gargamuni:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gargamuni:**
Yeah, they attend //āratikas// and class, because there's no other activity there.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is also good.

**Gargamuni:**
No, they should attend. They are attending. I have... We had nice... Bhakti... Your Guru Mahārāja appearance day, we had nice program. Some people came...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone should be engaged. That's all. No idle life. That should be... //Karma jyāyo hy akarma-kṛt.// What is that? //Śarīra-yātrāpi te na prasiddhyed akarmanaḥ.// Ah. //Niyata.... Niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyoḥ' akarmanaḥ, śarīra yātrāpi te// [[books:bg:3:8|[Bg. 3.8]]]. Kṛṣṇa never encouraged laziness, never encouraged. [break] "...people are maintaining some lazy men." Then everything will be spoiled.

**Gargamuni:**
That boy, Mahendra, told me when you... He came back. I met him in Germany. He said that you remarked that our Society is not love-making Society. But there are so many of these things are going on, and there is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I have seen. In Vṛndāvana.

**Gargamuni:**
...a burden for maintaining our temples because there's so many of these women and children with no husbands.

**Guru-kṛpā:**
Actually, in...

**Gargamuni:**
Because they do not take marriage life seriously in this age.

**Guru-kṛpā:**
In the temples, they engage the //brahmacārīs// to support the householders.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Guru-kṛpā:**
The //brahmacārīs// are supporting the householders.

**Prabhupāda:**
How?

**Guru-kṛpā:**
Well, they are doing the //saṅkīrtana// and collecting the funds, and the householders are spending.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] ...nature. //Uparvata pani.//[?] [break]

**Jayapatāka:**
About five //brahmacārīs// went down there, and they were lifting the //karāi// on the head, and they were encouraging the men, and the people became... And Guru-kṛpā was coming and Gargamuni. And the people were so happy that the devotees were there. They were working much harder.

**Prabhupāda:**
When a man takes his work in his own hand, it is sure to be done. So all of you encourage them.

**Jayapatāka:**
Maheśvāsa commented that although all day we're yelling at the men, when the work is over, they are laughing and saying "Hare Kṛṣṇa."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is association, a mass movement. [break] ...our boy, especially boy, in solitary place, then spoiled. Then the //māyā// is there immediately. That is very dangerous. [end]
