Yes, they like. And chili.

**Prabhupāda:**
And chili. That's all.

**Indian devotee (1):**
Actually, Prabhupāda, in Jaipuria, when they invited us, when we were in Kanpur, all the devotees, for three days we were eating very simple food, but the devotees liked so much. They were eating lots.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Jaipuria invite them?
