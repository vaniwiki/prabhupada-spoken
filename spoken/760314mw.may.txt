====== Morning Walk ======

**Hari-śauri:**
...He has all wealth, all strength, everything that you could possibly ever want. And He's offering to everyone, "So just surrender to Me, and I will take complete charge of you." But people are so foolish that they don't do it. They don't take any notice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why...? Suppose a big man, Rockefeller, says, "You simply surrender to me. I will take charge of you." Immediately one takes up. So why the man does not take Kṛṣṇa's word?

**Haṁsadūta:**
They are envious of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam...// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].

**Haṁsadūta:**
Envious of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Envious...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They're ignorant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mean, are such a great fool, they have been described as //mūḍhas.// That is perfect word. //Na māṁ duṣkṛtiṇo mūḍhāḥ prapadyante// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. //Duskṛtino mūḍhāḥ,// the most sinful rascal, he does not surrender. That is a fact.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
So for one who gives up sinful activities, does his sense of God consciousness become awakened?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, there is chance. Sinful activities means covering intelligence. Just like animals. A tiger is always engaged in sinful activity, but he does not know it is sinful. There are so many animals, they're simply engaged in sinful activities. Therefore they are excused, that "This tiger... His business is to act sinfully." Therefore God has given him place in a jungle: "You live there, and your sinful activities will not be taken into account."

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yesterday this man was finding difficulty discriminating between good and bad.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The gentleman who came yesterday.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] He is a rascal. He is another rascal. Everyone is like him. Therefore we call everyone rascal.

**Gurukṛpā:**
The common philosophy in America is "If it feels good, do it."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Gurukṛpā:**
"If it feels good, do it." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...man is less. He is simply beating drum. [break] ...the reason, nobody can explain?

**Pañcadraviḍa:**
That they won't surrender?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Jayādvaita:**
They have no confidence that Kṛṣṇa is there to actually fulfill responsi...

**Trivikrama:**
They say He is imagination.

**Mahāṁśa:**
//Āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]].

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Is due to sinful activities?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Sinful activities?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Duskrtino mūḍhaḥ.// Anyone commits sin, he is a rascal. Ordinarily also. A person kills somebody---that means he is rascal. He is rascal. He does not care for the law. That means rascal. So any sinful man is a rascal. Without being rascal, one cannot commit sin.

**Devotee:**
Last week in Bombay, Śrīla Prabhupāda, an American astronaut that went to the moon, they asked him if he experienced God or he felt some help from God in his trip. And he said, "No, I had no religious experience. God must have gone the other way."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Which way was that?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
He said that when he...

**Devotee:**
He went to the moon.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
When he went up in the space capsule to the moon, he had no religious experience, so he thought that there was no God.

**Prabhupāda:**
So space traveling induces a man to accept God?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
I think it's a material conception, that God is in the heavens, above the clouds.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is a fact.

**Pañcadravida:**
According to //Bhāgavatam,// though, these...

**Prabhupāda:**
Beyond this material universe, very, very far away.

**Hrdayananda:**
But another astronaut who went, he had religious experience, and after coming back he became missionary.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is natural.

**Sudāmā:**
Another astronaut went insane.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Sudāmā:**
And another astronaut went insane, like a madman.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. What was the reason?

**Sudāmā:**
For his insanity? He could not explain.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Insanity is also a result of sinful activities.

**Pañcadravida:**
Too much passion.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? We live in this material world, and we're in so much ignorance that we don't know who it belongs to. Is that due to sinful activities?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? What is this?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
We live in the material world, and we don't perceive who it actually belongs to---like living in a house, not knowing who the owner is. So is this sense of ignorance due to sinful activities?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Suppose if I go to America and if you do not know what is the political constitution of America, how the country is being managed, that is my foolishness. I must know that in America there is a president, the government is like this, the law is like this. Then I am intelligent. And if I do not know anything, if I think everything is automatically going on, then I am foolish rascal. They think like that: "Everything is going on, nature." They cannot explain what is this nature. Even this flower growing, the tree is growing---foolish people say, "This is nature." But intelligent person knows what is the law behind it, acting. That is intelligence and foolish. Nothing can happen. These big, big so-called scientists, they are talking of accidents. That is another rascal. Accidents, why? Why accident? This flower is not growing in this tree, and this flower is not growing in this tree by accident. Why it is not happening? Accidents means that. There is no law. Something happen without any law---that is accident. But we are generally seeing that this flower never grows in this tree and this flower never grows in this tree. Where is accident?

**Gurukṛpā:**
It's not accident.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Gurukṛpā:**
It's not accident.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, but they say. They have got a big theory, "accident theory."

**Madhudviṣa:**
They say that in due course this will evolve, that just as this flower, this tree is giving this flower, this rose tree, so after generations, generations of...

**Prabhupāda:**
And we have to believe these rascals, "in future." That is the same post-dated check, that "You take this ten thousand dollars. It will be paid three hundred years after." So I will have to accept that. I am not such a fool.

**Madhudviṣa:**
They will say, "You have to look back into history, and you'll see how history will repeat itself in the future."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that history? The rose flower gave birth to lotus flower? Where is that history?

**Madhudviṣa:**
This is what they say, that...

**Prabhupāda:**
That, that.... Therefore they are rascals.

**Madhudviṣa:**
...at one time that all the vegetation was...

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore they are rascals. Therefore they are rascals. Now they say..., the Darwin rascal says, that from monkey man came. Why the monkeys now do not give men? That is rascaldom, false theory.

**Gurukṛpā:**
They say they can make crossbreed.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another thing. You are the cause of this crossbreeding. It is not accident. You are making arrangement; therefore it is. There is cause. It is not accident. There is no accident. [break] ...man promises that "You just surrender to me; I will take care of you, everything," so whether I shall do it or not?

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why they do not do? Kṛṣṇa says that "You surrender, and I take care of."

**Acyutānanda:**
'Cause Kṛṣṇa is not here. We can see the man, and we can see him giving us.

**Prabhupāda:**
That means he has no eyes to see. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. I say //aṇḍāntara-sthaṁ paramāṇu-cayā...// [Bs. 5.35]. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. He is within your heart. But that means you are rascal. You do not know to see Kṛṣṇa.

**Gurukṛpā:**
But that's conditional.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurukṛpā:**
If I surrender to the big man, he should give me anything I want.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, so Kṛṣṇa says that.

**Gurukṛpā:**
But Kṛṣṇa says, "You cannot do this. You cannot do that." Therefore it is conditional.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then there is no surrender.

**Acyutānanda:**
Ultimately I know that Kṛṣṇa takes away everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then there is no surrender. You do not surrender.

**Acyutānanda:**
But I know that Kṛṣṇa takes away everything from His devotees ultimately, so I don't want to surrender.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is good for... That is good for you. Just like the physician says that "You surrender. You don't eat these things. I'll cure you." Will you accept this?

**Yaśodānandana:**
Well, when Kṛṣṇa will give me His mercy, then I'll surrender.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Yaśodānandana:**
When Kṛṣṇa will give the mercy, when He wills it, I'll surrender.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is already giving you, because without Kṛṣṇa's mercy you cannot live for a second.

**Gurukṛpā:**
So similarly, when He desires I serve Him, I will serve Him. But now He is not desiring.

**Madhudviṣa:**
They would say, "We are living and we are not serving Kṛṣṇa. You are living and you are serving Kṛṣṇa."

**Prabhupāda:**
But he is... That is another foolish question. He said that "You do it." He is not desiring? How foolish that is.

**Gurukṛpā:**
But He is not inspiring me to do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is inspiring? He is directly saying, "You do that." Is not instruction?

**Gurukṛpā:**
But He's not inspiring me.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see how fool. He is saying directly, "Do this," and still He is not inspiring. Just see.

**Mahāṁśa:**
He says that "Only by His mercy I will be able to do it."

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Mahāṁśa:**
He says, "Only by Kṛṣṇa's mercy I will be able to surrender to Him." So His mercy is on you, but His mercy has not come to me.

**Prabhupāda:**
And if you don't accept the mercy, then whose fault it is? I am giving you mercy: "You take it." And if you do not take it, then it is my fault?

**Revatīnandana:**
But I don't want to surrender. I want to //be// Kṛṣṇa. I don't want to //serve// Kṛṣṇa; I want to //be// Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
But that you have tried for millions of lives.

**Revatīnandana:**
So I'm a rascal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore you are rascal.

**Revatīnandana:**
I have so many plans, though. Someday...

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Therefore you are rascal. You have tried already. Kṛṣṇa has given you chances. "You wanted to become this? All right, you become this. You wanted to become this? All right, you become this." So that you have tried, but you have failed, and still, "All right, go on."

**Revatīnandana:**
But I am a fool, so I will keep trying. I will not surrender to Kṛṣṇa.

**Jayatīrtha:**
They like to be a fool.

**Prabhupāda:**
And...

**Gurukṛpā:**
They say, "You Westerners have enjoyed the material life, and we have not. Therefore let us enjoy, and then we will become."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that enjoyment? Is that enjoyment? They are working so hard for ten rupees. Is that enjoyment? The enjoyment is there, "future, future." "At night I shall go to my wife and enjoy"---that is enjoyment. But for that enjoyment he is working so hard. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. Everyone is thinking, "I shall enjoy at night," and working hard. That's all. This is enjoyment.

**Pañcadravida:**
But why do you blame us for not surrendering when we see that even Kṛṣṇa's devotees can't surrender to Him? They come to us and ask us for money for these books. Why don't they give them away?

**Prabhupāda:**
But Kṛṣṇa's devotee... When he surrenders, he is devotee. When he does not, he is not devotee; he is trying to become devotee.

**Pañcadravida:**
But why do they ask us for money for these books? Why don't they give them away, if they're so surrendered to Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why shall I give you? Why shall I give you?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Kṛṣṇa says He is the proprietor of everything. Why He has to ask me?

**Pañcadravida:**
Yes, why is He asking us for money?

**Prabhupāda:**
And He is proprietor of your money. Give Him. [laughter] I think our Girirāja played this trick.

**Revatīnandana:**
Yes. I have also played the same trick.

**Prabhupāda:**
And one boy gave his all money.

**Revatīnandana:**
They say it is all one. So I say, "Well, if it is all one, then it doesn't make any difference if you have the money or I have the money, so give it to me." It works. They don't like it very much.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you give it. "Your money is my money; my money is my money."

**Pañcadravida:**
In your article, though, you said that Dhṛtarāṣṭra said he was better than the //sannyāsīs// because they were coming to him, begging for money. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
"...beg. They help you. You are keeping Kṛṣṇa's money; you'll be punished. So return it to Kṛṣṇa; you'll be happy."

**Haṁsadūta:**
Voluntary disclosure.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Voluntary disclosure. [break] //...abhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ paramam...//

**Pañcadravida:**
Prabhupāda, why is it that a devotee falls down? That he wants to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, and again he falls back to the material world to become a false enjoyer?

**Prabhupāda:**
He's more sinful. //Yeṣām anta-gataṁ pāpam// [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]. He has not yet finished his sinful activities; therefore it takes some time. Neither he surrenders fully. Just like somebody said, "I want to enjoy material world." Just see. That is sinful.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Kṛṣṇa will protect any living entity who surrenders?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Even from all sinful reactions.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
//Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, if he surrenders actually. He says. He says, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo.//

**Gurukṛpā:**
That surrender has to be with perfect knowledge, or else it won't be strong enough.

**Prabhupāda:**
If he surrenders, the knowledge will be there. That knowledge... It is very psychological. If you surrender... If I surrender to you, I must have some conception that you are very big. That much conception will help you, not more than this. Simply accept that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. //Kṛṣṇa bhakti kaile sarva karma kṛta haya.// If you simply understand this, that "If I surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then everything is in my knowledge." //Sraddha śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya, kṛṣṇa bhakti kaile sarva karma...// And then he becomes immediately. And if I surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then my life is successful. This much. Is it very difficult?

**Gurukṛpā:**
No, it's the easiest thing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kavirāja Gosvāmī has explained very nicely. This is //viśvāsa. Śraddhā śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya.// Explain, Acyutānanda, this. Explain this.

> śraddhā śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya
> kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:62|[Cc. Madhya 22.62]]].

**Acyutānanda:**
If you have firm faith in Kṛṣṇa and surrender unto Him, then all other activities and responsibilities are fulfilled by serving Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it.

**Acyutānanda:**
//Dāy mama gelā; tuwā...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tuwā o pada baraṇe.// This is required.

**Acyutānanda:**
Serving the root.

**Prabhupāda:**
"My only responsibility is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa"---then this very conception will save you. [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
I spoke with one man who argued that "Kṛṣṇa is very cruel, because He knows everything past, present and future, so He knew that we would all fall down from the spiritual sky, but still, He gave us the independence to fall down."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Rāmeśvara:**
"Even though He knew we would fall, because He knows everything..."

**Acyutānanda:**
That's a common question.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another foolish question. Unless you have got independence, what is your life? Then you are dead stone. You want to become a dead stone? That is not Kṛṣṇa's concern. Kṛṣṇa does not give such perfection, that you become a dead stone.

**Acyutānanda:**
The thing is that because Kṛṣṇa knows the future---past, present and future---so He knew that we would fall down, so why didn't He help me?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Future means, just like... This is the law of nature, that if you steal, you'll be punished. So if I say, "Oh, you are stealing; you'll be punished," this is future. Suppose this is the month of March, and if I say, "In the month of July there will be rain." So I know; you know; everyone knows. This is not a future telling. The natural sequence is everyone knows it.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But does that means that Kṛṣṇa doesn't know something?

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa... If everyone knows, why Kṛṣṇa does not know? "He knows everything" means this common sense everyone knows.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Does He know what you will choose?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Just try to understand. Future means like this: nature's law. And it will happen. After summer there will be rainy season; it will happen, and they will call, "I am foretelling future." It is not future; it is natural sequence, automatically happened.

**Satsvarūpa:**
But that's predictable. If I have my own free will, what I'm going to do, you don't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, if you are in knowledge, you can predict. But if you are fool, you cannot say. If I see that in July there will be rain, and if you are a fool, you'll protest. That is your foolishness. It is natural sequence, one after another.

**Madhudviṣa:**
When is the natural sequence...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Natural sequence... Just like you are infected some contaminous disease; you will suffer. There is a story that one fool was sitting on a branch of a tree and he was cutting off. And somebody said, "You'll fall down." "Ha, fall down." But when he fell down he said, "Oh, you are a great astrologer." So who goes to the astrologer? Only fools and rascal. No sane man goes. They know that what is... //Yad bhavyantam tad bhavata.//[?] What is to happen, that will happen. Why shall I go to astrologer?

**Gurukṛpā:**
I can prepare myself to make change.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. My only business is to serve Kṛṣṇa. I don't mind what will happen next.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
That desire to serve Kṛṣṇa, though, that Kṛṣṇa...

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't talk like foolish. That desire everyone has. He is serving. He is serving so many things, but he doesn't want to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is his foolishness. He is serving //māyā;// still, he denies to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is his misfortune. //Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. So unless one is very fortunate, he does not agree to serve Kṛṣṇa.

**Madhudviṣa:**
So that future is determined by the great souls, such as yourself.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that...

**Madhudviṣa:**
Because you are creating people's good fortune.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fortune, there. It is already there. I am simply informing.

**Madhudviṣa:**
No, but you actually engage them in //ajñāta-sukṛti,// meritorious activities, even unwillingly performed.

**Prabhupāda:**
But this is the duty of everyone. One should not... That is enjoined in the... //Gurur na sa syāt// [[books:sb:5:5:18|[SB 5.5.18]]]: "One should not become a //guru// if he cannot do that." Otherwise he is cheating. Why he should become //guru?// Why he should accept service from so many people if he cannot rightly direct them? Then he becomes bound up by the //karma// laws. If I take one paisa from you without any service, I have to pay you four paisa.

**Mahāṁśa:**
In the spiritual world the living entity is full of knowledge, so does he...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is enjoined, ordered, "You should not become //guru// if you cannot save him. You should not become father if you cannot save him." This is śāstric injunction. First word is //gurur na sa syāt pitā na sa syāt// [[books:sb:5:5:18|[SB 5.5.18]]]. Why you are claiming? Just like... We are not going to become //guru// like that... What is that rascal? Yogi...?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Guru Mahārāja.

**Revatīnandana:**
Which one? There's many rascals.

**Prabhupāda:**
That big rascal, Transcendental Meditation.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Maharishi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Maharishi. He is giving assurance, "If you practice this //yoga,// then you'll be very able to do your business nicely, your..." These things are... And he is //guru.//

**Mahāṁśa:**
And he charges them a fabulous amount of money.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. No, unless...

**Gurukṛpā:**
That verse, //guravo bahavo santi śiṣya-śāntapa hārakaḥ...//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, they say to their friend that "These people want to be cheated. Why shall I not cheat?" He says. One of his secretaries came to him... "If you want God, then go to Bhaktivedanta Swami."

**Pañcadravida:**
He said that.

**Prabhupāda:**
He said, this Mahesh Yogi. "My business is cheating, because these rascals wanted to be cheated. So why shall I not cheat and get some money?"

**Gurukṛpā:**
But he doesn't give the money to you, though. He knows you are real.

**Prabhupāda:**
No... Not... That is another thing, but he knows that "God consciousness you can get there."

**Gurukṛpā:**
Then he's a rascal.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yesterday you said that one cheater takes from the other cheater; so he is a cheater, he is taking from other cheaters.

**Gurukṛpā:**
You mentioned in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that the one cheater takes the money, another cheater takes it...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, his business is cheating. His business is cheating. He said, "These rascals want to be cheated, so why not cheat?"

**Madhudviṣa:**
So we shouldn't be so angry at him. Some people are serving coffee because people want coffee. Some people are selling //bīḍīs// because people want //bīḍīs.// So if some people want to be cheated, so he is simply performing a function of society.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the world. Therefore the whole world is the society of cheater and cheated. That is the version of my Guru Mahārāja. The whole so-called human society means a bunch of cheaters and cheated. That's all.

**Pañcadravida:**
//Īśopaniṣad// says, //asuryā nāma te lokā// [[books:iso:3|[Īśo mantra 3]]]. He is going to hell even though he knows that he is cheating. He is also going to hell, even if he is conscious that he's cheating.

**Prabhupāda:**
So don't be cheater; don't be cheated. That is intelligence.

**Pañcadravida:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is our fortune that we've come in contact with a qualified //guru?// What have we done to qualify to come in contact with you?

**Revatīnandana:**
In other words, why do some come and others not come?

**Prabhupāda:**
It is the //ajñāta-sukṛti,// say. //Ajñāta-sukṛti.// You might have done something, very pious activities, which you do not know, but on the effect of.

**Madhudviṣa:**
So it seems like it's up to chance, then.

**Prabhupāda:**
No chance. Just like a sinful man. Some saintly person comes to him and he gives some money to him. He does not know that "I am doing very pious activity," but because he has given, he becomes pious.

**Revatīnandana:**
If not even a blade of grass moves unless Kṛṣṇa sanctions it, then why does someone have the opportunity to perform such //ajnata-sukrti,// another person not?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Kṛṣṇa wants... Suppose a saintly person comes to a very sinful man. He needs some money. Immediately Kṛṣṇa says, "Give him some money. He requires." So he says, "All right, sir, take it." So Kṛṣṇa's desires, he gives. Unless Kṛṣṇa dictates from within, how he can give?

**Hari-śauri:**
So then where is the question of free will? If I want to give or not to give...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, free will under Kṛṣṇa. You can become free will and become a big man immediately. Your free will sanctioned by Kṛṣṇa. You are not so free that whatever you like, you can do.

**Madhudviṣa:**
So even if I want to perform some //ajnata-sukrti,// it is only by Kṛṣṇa's mercy that I will do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Man proposes and God disposes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is stated by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍe bhramite kono bhāgyavān jīva
> guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti latā bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

As soon as he gives to a saintly person, //bhakta,// he immediately acquires some asset of future development. Immediately.

**Acyutānanda:**
If someone gives to a person for spiritual..., consciously for spiritual improvement...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no question of...

**Acyutānanda:**
...and the person misuses the money, does he benefit?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
If a man says, "I am giving you this donation because it is a spiritual organization," but if the money is misused, does that man benefit?

**Prabhupāda:**
If money is misused, then both of them become implicated. If it is not used for Kṛṣṇa, then both of them becomes under the laws of //karma.//

**Acyutānanda:**
But that man is sincere.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, this word "sincere," there is no meaning unless he is a devotee. //Ei bala ei manda sab mano-dharma:// "These are all mental concoction." There is no meaning. "This man is good," "This man is sincere," "This man is bad," "This man is...," they are all mental concoction. Only good is he who is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Others all rascals.

**Hari-śauri:**
So if Kṛṣṇa has given the dictation, then is He dictating every sinful man to give?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Hari-śauri:**
Is He dictating every sinful man to give?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why do you question like that? Kṛṣṇa is so foolish that He will dictate to give to a foolish, er, sinful man? It is odd question.

**Hari-śauri:**
This is that point that does one come to..., does one get contact with a pure devotee and advance like that from his own free will, from accepting the mercy of the spiritual master or not?

**Prabhupāda:**
What does he say? Hmm?

**Hari-śauri:**
Well the point... The point...

**Prabhupāda:**
Somebody answer.

**Jayādvaita:**
Not every sinful man is dictated to give money; otherwise they'd all be giving us money. They're all sinful. We'd be getting money from everyone.

**Revatīnandana:**
But then the question is why some and not others also?

**Trivikrama:**
Kṛṣṇa is in everyone's heart.

**Gurukṛpā:**
But some are innocent.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Kṛṣṇa's dictation.

**Revatīnandana:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And you cannot bind Kṛṣṇa to dictate in a similar way. If He likes, He can ask a sinful man, "Do this." If He doesn't like, He may not act. That is Kṛṣṇa.

**Revatīnandana:**
So ultimately it is simply by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Revatīnandana:**
...that he comes back to Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So it is Kṛṣṇa's business where to show mercy, where not to show. You cannot oblige Him that "You show mercy everywhere." No. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-maya-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. Kṛṣṇa... You cannot oblige Kṛṣṇa, "You do this." That is not Kṛṣṇa. That is not Kṛṣṇa. If one is obliged to act to your dictation, then he is not Kṛṣṇa. Therefore whatever Kṛṣṇa likes, He'll do. You cannot oblige Him, that "You have to do it." No. That is //karma-mimāṁsa,// that "If good work gives good result, so why should we care for Kṛṣṇa? We shall do the good work." That is... Ordinary people, they think like that. //Karma-mimāṁsa.// "If I do good work, Kṛṣṇa will be obliged to give me good effect. Why shall I care for Kṛṣṇa?" That is //karma-mimāṁsa.// "Work is final. Do good work, that's all." They say like that. But we say, even if you do good work, if Kṛṣṇa does not want it, then it will not produce good result. That is Kṛṣṇa.

**Trivikrama:**
We don't have the mercy of Kṛṣṇa yet, so...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Everyone has got the mercy, but that mercy is not obligatory. If He likes, He can give you mercy; if He does not like, He may not.

**Trivikrama:**
But everyone has it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone... He is giving mercy. That is general. But if He does not like, He may not give you. You cannot make Him obliged.

**Pañcadravida:**
So why is it, then, if it's a question of //ajñāta-sukṛti...// The Indians, from their birth they're watering //tulasī,// they're chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, they're doing so many activities, but mostly your disciples are foreigners.

**Prabhupāda:**
So that... No, means that is temporary. They may come again. It will never go in vain. Just like this cloud. Cloud is meant for raining. Now it is not raining, but when there is sufficient cloud, it will rain. You cannot say there is no rain. There is, but it is not sufficiently collected. When it is sufficiently collected, then.

**Revatīnandana:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the //śāstras,// like in //Bhagavad-gītā,// Kṛṣṇa gives certain criteria...

**Prabhupāda:**
Sometimes you will see, even no sufficient cloud, still raining.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes, one cloud.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is superior direction. It is not your direction. [break]

**Revatīnandana:**
Kṛṣṇa explains why He comes at a certain time, and He says, "I come whenever there are certain conditions."

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, not "certain time."

**Revatīnandana:**
Does He ever say... Is there any statement in the //śāstra...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Now it is six-thirty. Generally I go down. If I like, I don't go.

**Devotees:**
[laughter] //Jaya// Prabhupāda! [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...party did not go Navadvīpa?

**Revatīnandana:**
We went to another place. We did not go to Navadvīpa. We went to the temple of Murāri Gupta over here, just behind the //yoga-pīṭha.// It's just around the bend.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Today they are going to Nṛsiṁha-dvīpa[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Yesterday down at the Ganges there was everywhere //Bhāgavatam// class, //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// class was going on in different groups, and //kīrtana// was going on everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [//shenai// band playing] [break]

**Gurukṛpā:**
Prabhupāda internationalized [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
They can go to the Ganges.

**Gurukṛpā:**
That is better. The lake looks very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurukṛpā:**
When we went over to the Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta's //samādhi// that morning, there were so many fish in the pond that the water was constantly moving. It was very beautiful. [break]

**Jayādvaita:**
...instead of building you the house, we should print books, but I think we have to build you the house because the person //bhāgavatam// is as good as the book //Bhāgavatam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is the conclusion. Yes. //Bhāgavata paragiya bhāgavata sthāne.// One has to learn book //Bhāgavata// from the person //bhāgavata. Bhāgavata paragiya bhāgavata sthāne.// [break]

**Rāmeśvara:**
...beginning to come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Rāmeśvara:**
Just beginning to come.

**Tripurāri:**
Now it is all finished?

**Rāmeśvara:**
I was just told that last night the winds were blowing so hard that they took everything down so the plexiglass wouldn't break. And this morning, right after your class, they're going to put it all up again. [break]

**Tripurāri:**
Rādhā-Dāmodara buses.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tripurāri:**
Gaura-Nitāi Deities on each bus.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that framework?

**Tripurāri:**
That is preaching outside somewhere, at a college.

**Rāmeśvara:**
This is that TV show. Dhṛṣṭadyumna was on that show.

**Prabhupāda:**
That meeting was very nice. [break] ...experience. So much money is being spoiled and squandered. You are collecting money... [break] [end]
