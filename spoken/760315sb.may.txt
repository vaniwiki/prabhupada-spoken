Translation: "My dear Lord, when You appeared as Hayagrīva with a head like that of a horse to kill the two demons named Madhu and Kaiṭabha, who were full of the modes of passion and ignorance, after killing the demons You delivered the Vedic knowledge to Lord Brahmā. Therefore all the great saintly persons accept Your forms as transcendental, untinged by material qualities."

**Prabhupāda:**

So spiritual kingdom is beyond this material world made of three modes of material nature, //sattva-rajas-tamaḥ.// So when incarnation of the Supreme Lord comes... //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]], Kṛṣṇa has given us. We are fallen down from the spiritual kingdom to this material world on account of desiring to fulfill our material senses. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He has given us the Vedic literatures. //Anādi bahir mukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela.// This is the statement in the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Ataeva kṛṣṇa veda purāṇa karilā.// Because we have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, //anadi... Anadi// means before the beginning of this creation. The beginning of this creation is called //ādi,// beginning, but our forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa is //anādi. Anādi. Anādi bahir mukha.// We are working in this life, in this material world, struggling for existence to get happiness. That is the aim of life. But because we have forgotten Kṛṣṇa, we do not know the source of happiness. //Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt// [//Vedānta-sūtra// 1.1.12]. The //ānandamaya-vigraha, sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha// [Bs. 5.1], we have forgotten Kṛṣṇa. Still, we are searching after //ānanda,// blissfulness. This is our struggle for existence. //Manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. We are in this //prakṛti,// in this material nature, //prakṛti-sthāni,// and, being dictated by the mind, making plans to become happy. But that is not possible. //Manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni.// This is... Due to our forgetfulness, we are struggling for existence to get happiness, but because we do not know what is the source of happiness, it is called struggle for existence. This is going on.

So this is going on not only in this life, before this life also, //anādi, anādi.// So once we get the chance to understand what is the problem of life, and this human life is given a chance. By evolution, by nature's way, 8,400,000 species of life we are coming through. Then the nature has given one chance, this human form of life. Now it is for understanding what is our position. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// But if we do not take care of this questioning... //Ke āmi kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya// [[books:cc:madhya:20:102|[Cc. Madhya 20.102]]]. Sanātana Gosvāmī placed this inquiry before Caitanya Mahāprabhu. To approach //guru// means to inquire about himself, "What I am?" That is intelligence. Sanātana Gosvāmī was the minister. He was very opulent. //Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tucchavat.// But when he came to his senses after meeting Caitanya Mahāprabhu, he wanted to know, "What I am?" This is real inquiry. He could be very satisfied to get answer himself that "I am minister. I have got so big salary. I am so respect." No, he was not satisfied. He went to //guru,// Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The Vedic injunction is, //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. Everyone is conscious of the struggle for existence, but they are not serious enough that "Why this struggle for existence?" That "Why?" required. That is human life. The dog is suffering. He is hungry, he's going to a place for some food, and instead of food, he's getting a stroke by the stick. He barks very... He's disappointed, that "I wanted food, but I got the stick." [laughter] "I wanted bread; I got stone." This is going on. This is going on. And therefore, in the human society also, they are also struggling and making plans for economic development so that instead of stone, they can get bread. But the struggle is going on. There is no settlement. That is not possible. That is not possible. Either you go to this country or that country, you accept this "ism" or that "ism," unless you come to Kṛṣṇa, there is no possibility of peace. That is stated, very simple words, in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that how to stop this struggle for existence.

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ
> sarva-loka-maheśvaram
> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati
> [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]

So this is going on. As soon as there is creation... Brahmā was created, and he was given the Vedic knowledge. //Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]], we get it. Brahmā was born. He was to establish the kingdom of God or... As Brahmā was born, the other living entities also were in the body of Garbhodakaśayī Viṣṇu. They were also to take birth later on. And before their birth, Brahmā was instructed Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge means these bewildered living entities struggling for existence may get Vedic knowledge so that they can revive their old, original Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the purpose of Vedic knowledge. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said, //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. The Vedic... What is Vedic knowledge? Vedic knowledge means to revive our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is Vedic knowledge. If you revive your Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is the perfection of Vedic knowledge. But if you read only //Vedas// and perform formalities, ritualistic ceremonies, but you do not awaken your Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is useless waste of time. That is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,//

> dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ
> viśvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ
> notpādayed ratiṁ yadi
> śrama eva hi kevalam
> [[books:sb:1:2:8|[SB 1.2.8]]]

You may be a very religious person---never mind you are Hindu, Muslim or Christian or anyone---or according to your religious principles, ritualistic ceremonies, you execute very nicely, //svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsām.// But after doing all these things, if you do not become God consciousness, God conscious, or you do not understand what is God, then the //Bhāgavata// says that it is simply waste of time. //Śrama eva hi kevalam.//

So human life is meant for understanding the Supreme, our connection with the Supreme Being. That is real human life. Therefore the //Vedas// are there. So as soon as Brahmā was born... Because he is in charge of this universe. There are innumerable universes and innumerable Brahmās also. //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa koṭi// [Bs. 5.40]. //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// [Bs. 5.48]. So Brahmā is //jagad-aṇḍa-nātha.// He's the chief person within this material world..., in this universe. So he is in charge; therefore he was given the Vedic knowledge. And he got the Vedic knowledge, but at the same time, two demons known as Madhu-Kaiṭabha, they wanted to snatch away, take away the Vedic //mantras// from Brahmā. This is the attempt from the very beginning. The devotees following the disciplic succession of Brahmā... Just like we are. We belong to the //Brahma-sampradāya;// several times I have explained. So our original //guru// is Brahmā, Svayambhū. Therefore he is one of the great personality, //svayambhūr nāradaḥ śaṁbhuḥ kapilaḥ kaumāro manuḥ// [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]. These are twelve //mahājanas,// men of authority. So Brahmā is man of authority, the demigod, the supreme demigod, the best of the demigods. So these Madhu-Kaiṭabha, Madhu-Kaiṭabha, they took away. //Rajas-tamaḥ.// Why? They were full of //rajas-tama,// and Brahmā is //sattva-guṇa.//

So //sattva-guṇa// and //rajas-tamaḥ.// This material world, there is three qualities, so there is always struggle. If you want to remain in the //sattva-guṇa,// then the //rajas-tamo guṇa,// they will give you trouble. //Rajas-tamo-bhāvaḥ. Tato rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. So we are trying to introduce this //sattva-guṇa,// and above //sattva-guṇa, śuddha-sattva.// This //sattva-guṇa...// Just like sometimes we experience that one person is elevated to the brahminical principle, //sannyāsī// principle, but all of a sudden he falls down, he becomes a demon. We have got experience. He becomes demon. Very high... So this material world is so contaminated that even you are on the //sattva-guṇa,// there is chance of being contaminated by the //rajas-tamo guṇa.// The struggle is there. Therefore we have to become very, very careful. Or Kṛṣṇa will help. If you want to remain in //sattva-guṇa,// in purity, then Kṛṣṇa will help. Just like here, as soon as Brahmā was disturbed by the demons full of //rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa,// immediately the Lord came in Hayagrīva-//mūrti// incarnation. That is... Kṛṣṇa is also very much anxious to give us... //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ pranaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. If you remain a pure devotee, always surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, you should know it very well that Kṛṣṇa will give you protection in any calamity. Don't be worried. Simply we must have the faith. That is surrender. Surrender means //avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa, viśvāsa pālana// [Śaraṇāgati]. You must be faithful that "I am engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. I may go to hell or heaven, it doesn't matter. I am going to serve Him. It is sure that Kṛṣṇa will give me protection." So there should be no hesitation. If somebody is ordered, "Go to hell and preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness," he should remain faithful to Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa will give all protection.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the principle. Kṛṣṇa's business is //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati, tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmi// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]], //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca...// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. The //sādhu... Sādhu// means //kṛṣṇa-bhakta sādhu,// not this dress. If you are always keeping Kṛṣṇa within yourself, then you are //sādhu.// And you are //yogī// also.

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gata āntarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo ma...
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

These things are there always. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. So those who are always keeping Kṛṣṇa within the heart, they are //sādhu.// So //paritrāṇāya sādhūnām.// They are //sad...// They are //sādhus. Sādhu// means who are always engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, always thinking of Kṛṣṇa.

So here, as Brahmā was protected from the great demons Madhu-Kaiṭabha, Prahlāda Mahārāja..., Prahlāda Mahārāja was protected from the great demon Hiraṇyakaśipu. There are many, many instances. So the demons are always there. They are always ready to disturb devotees. That is going on. But a devotee's business is to revive the Kṛṣṇa consciousness of the conditioned soul. That is devotee's business. As Kṛṣṇa comes personally to give them some help, similarly, Kṛṣṇa's servants also, they take Kṛṣṇa's business and try to help these fallen conditioned souls to revive their original Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So here is the example, that Brahmā was given the Vedic knowledge. //Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye.// Brahmā is //ādi-kavi.// He's the first learned man within this universe. We do not follow this nonsense Darwin's theory. Our beginning of this creation is from the most learned man, Brahmā, not from the monkey. [laughter] We do not follow this rascal philosophy. We do not follow. So our beginning is Lord Brahmā, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, empowered to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Vedic knowledge. Why //Vedas// there? //Anādi bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela, ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa karilā// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]]. So //Veda-Purāṇa// is required. Why the //Vedas// are there for us? To revive our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And the gist of the //Vedas,// the //śāstra,// is //Bhagavad-gītā, sarva-śāstra vinijya// [?]. So if we read //Bhagavad-gītā// carefully, spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and follow it according to the direction of the Brahmā and his disciplic succession, then Kṛṣṇa will give you all protection from the demons. There is no doubt. That is Kṛṣṇa's business. He said, //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. //Dharmasya glāniḥ// means discrepancy in the matter of understanding //Vedas.// That is //dharmasya glāniḥ.//

We have read in the Sixth Chapter, //veda-vihitaṁ dharma:// "//Dharma// means which is enjoined, which is ordered by the //Vedas.//" //Śruti.// Caitanya... Our Rūpa Gosvāmī said,

> śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-
> pañcarātriki-vidhiṁ vinā
> aikāntikī harer bhaktir
> utpātāyaiva...
> [Brs. 1.2.101]

So we must follow //śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-śāstra-vidhi.// Kṛṣṇa condemns such persons, rascals, who do not accept this //śāstra-vidhi// and manufacture something. These rascal has spoiled the whole world. No. //Śāstra-vidhi,// the Vedic knowledge. //Anādi bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela, ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa karilā.// So we have to take protection of the Vedic knowledge, and that is summarized, and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is the ripened fruit of Vedic knowledge. //Nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalaṁ idam// [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]]. //Kalpa-taru,// the tree... You get a tree. You protect tree. So this Vedic knowledge is called //kalpa-taru. Kalpa-taru// means whatever you want, you can get from the tree. Here we have got experience, you can get mango from the mango tree, but a //kalpa-taru,// you can get mango, apple, pineapple, anything. That is called //kalpa-taru.// So from the //Vedas// you can get all kinds of knowledge---material, spiritual, anything. Therefore it is called //kalpa-taru.// And the //kalpa-taru...// A //taru// means tree, and the tree... We nourish tree to get a nice fruit. So this //Bhāgavatam// is the fruit of the Vedic tree, //kalpa-taru,// and it is ripened also, not unripened. Unripened fruit you cannot eat, but ripened, ripened in the tree, mango, is very palatable. So it is //nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalaṁ idam// [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]].

So if we read //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and //Bhagavad-gītā,// these two literatures, then we get all Vedic knowledge, and then we can revive our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And to do this business there is no difficulty. Kṛṣṇa will give you all protection, provided you remain, I mean to say, adhere to the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etaṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. The //māyā// will not touch you. You'll be happy.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya!// [end]
