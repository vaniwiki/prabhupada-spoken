====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
They'll come like that.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
//Jaya.//

**Trivikrama:**
The road must be bigger.

**Devotee (1):**
Two lanes. They'll probably have... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Within that temple, there will be the tree of planetary system, electric bulb, and they'll move round. And upon that, sun will run. That requires electrical mechanism. [break] ...all side, other, different planets and Vaikuṇṭha-loka... There will be escalator to go.

**Yaśodānandana:**
I think in some of the Western countries they have these elevators with brass windows all around, so that one can, even though he's going up, he still sees all around. It would be very fascinating for these people.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What to speak of escalators?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What to speak of escalators?

**Yaśodānandana:**
And that light system.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
People will pay just to get on that escalator every day. [laughter]

**Pañcadravida:**
In Los Angeles they have installed a speed walk at the airport, an escalator that you can walk on.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you are not going to Calcutta? Calcutta?

**Jayapatākā:**
I was going to go in a day or two.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there is no news? [break] Of course, if there is devotee. Otherwise not.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
I was thinking perhaps this year to begin with one car.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm? Yes. Last year, Philadelphia, there was one car. Oh, crowd was... Like that.

**Pañcadravida:**
If there's no Jagannātha Deities we can use...?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Jagannātha.

**Pañcadravida:**
Has to be Jagannātha.

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't try to manufacture ideas.

**Pañcadravida:**
Most... Most of our temples, we have no Jagannātha Deities.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Anyway, it will be arranged.

**Madhudviṣa:**
You can get some Jagannātha Deities here in India, big ones.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes, that's not very difficult to do. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...men came to see //paṇḍāl?//

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Naturally.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Everyone who came saw the //paṇḍāl.//

**Hṛdayānanda:**
There was a big crowd going in constantly, a river of people.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It was impossible to walk.

**Prabhupāda:**
Next year the Chinese men must come. [laughter]

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Chinese //bhaktas.//

**Madhudviṣa:**
Chinese and Russian.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Russian, you cannot distinguish, but Chinese can be distinguished.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
From the face.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Just like the Manipur people come sometimes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is same stock.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Manipur, Chinese, Cambodian. [break] Many Chinese, for culture. I know. All came.

**Pañcadravida:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, if they invite you to China, you'll go?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes, certainly. I can go immediately. I have no objection. [break]

**Pañcadravida:**
Everyone was chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and saying...

**Prabhupāda:**
Crowd also?

**Pañcadravida:**
Yeah, the crowd here... There was practically... I didn't see any incidents of anybody doing anything wrong or trying to cause trouble.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Jayapatākā Mahārāja just said he was measuring the people as they came in. In one minute, an average of a 150 people came.

**Jayapatākā:**
That was only low time. And peak time was 400.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Per minute?

**Jayapatākā:**
Per minute.

**Prabhupāda:**
How many visitors, according to your calculations?

**Jayapatākā:**
So that's about between 9,000 to 25,000 an hour.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
They averaged fifteen or twenty thousand an hour.

**Jayapatākā:**
Per hour. Then they, all day they're coming...

**Hṛdayānanda:**
So yes, well over a //lakh.//

**Pañcadravida:**
Two //lakhs.// Last night was big. Last night...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, the police officer said that "From all different parts of Bengal they are coming to see your temple."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This never before has happened?

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Gurukṛpā:**
We realized last night our temple is too small.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [laughter]

**Gurukṛpā:**
And the road, you could not even walk down it. It took me fifteen minutes to get to the gate.

**Prabhupāda:**
I therefore planned four buildings like that. You know. And that was my plan, four buildings like that besides temple and my house. That was the original plan.

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
There was one Kṛṣṇa-kṛpā Brahmacārī. You met him a few years ago, told him to come here, and he saw the //prasāda// room. He said he has never seen such a well-organized //prasādam// room, //prasādam// distribution. Everyone was very well disciplined and what-not. He was very impressed. He'll be coming today at five p.m. He was a physics professor at some college in Calcutta.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, all this credit goes to Jayapatākā Mahārāja. Yes. He is struggling from the very beginning. Others who were in the beginning, they have all gone.

**Pañcadravida:**
He was the first.

**Jayapatākā:**
Only your mercy, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You are always keeping...

**Prabhupāda:**
So supply nice food, //prasādam.//

**Jayapatākā:**
This new building is equal to three buildings.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Jayapatākā:**
The new building is equal to three of these buildings.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is not so broad.

**Jayapatākā:**
But it is six times as long.

**Yaśodānandana:**
But there's still space...

**Jayapatākā:**
Five times as long...

**Yaśodānandana:**
But there's still space around to build more buildings also

**Prabhupāda:**
Five times?

**Jayapatākā:**
Six times as long.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
About six times longer.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And it's.... This building, including the grounds...

**Jayapatākā:**
So this, at least two buildings.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This building, including the grounds...

**Prabhupāda:**
But it is not going to be four stories.

**Jayapatākā:**
No. But five times as long, and two story. That means ten sides. On this, they got eight sides.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This, this building actually only has three floors.

**Jayapatākā:**
Yeah.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Not four floors.

**Jayapatākā:**
So in that way, it's...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That one has two.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Half of it's kitchen.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This has three.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, there are floors, ground floors.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That also has three, if you count the ground floor.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So that's three, plus six times longer. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...just decorate green leaves and yellow flower. By chance? Rascals say, "By chance." It is coming by chance? Just see. Show me anything within your experience which has come by chance. Anything, whatever you like, show me, come by chance, which has come by chance.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
I can say..., "Yes, I was..., became sick by chance."

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Hṛdayānanda:**
"I became sick by chance."

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Then again you are rascal. You infected some disease; then you became sick. There is no chance.

**Gurukṛpā:**
The other day, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I went in the shower, and I turned on the shower, and the thing broke and hit me on the head. It was chance.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, because you are rascal, therefore it hit you. [laughter]

**Gurukṛpā:**
So it was chance.

**Prabhupāda:**
It was not chance. You are a rascal, and you were hit on the head. [laughs] That is not chance. The cause is your rascalism. So you cannot find out anything by chance. Madhudviṣa Mahārāja, you can find out anything by chance? [laughing] This is simply rascaldom, chance theory.

**Pañcadravida:**
What about...? What about gambling, Prabhupāda? Somebody wins; somebody loses. That's by chance.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not chance.

**Madhudviṣa:**
They would say, "Everything is by chance." You say green..., yellow flower with green leaf. So... But through evolution there has been so many other combinations. Now we're just...

**Prabhupāda:**
But then evolution is the cause. Then evolution is the cause. How you can say "chance"?

**Madhudviṣa:**
No, it's just many, many different combinations. Now you are seeing the yellow and green...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Madhudviṣa:**
...so you are appreciating.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is a process in the evolution. Therefore you find. You cannot say it's chance.

**Pañcadravida:**
Well, the evolution happens by chance.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Trivikrama:**
Just like he said. All the trees are growing up, not one going this way..., not by chance one is...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. Nothing by chance. It is a wrong theory.

**Satsvarūpa:**
If you throw dice, they may come up in one...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then dice becomes cause? Chance?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Well, what causes it to be seven or eleven or another number?

**Pañcadravida:**
Chance.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not chance. You do not know. Therefore you say.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Ah! Because they don't know, they say "chance."

**Trivikrama:**
That's right, because I don't know. Ignorance.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They want to cover their ignorance by this theory, "chance." They want to become very intelligent by chance. That is their... That is not the fact. For intelligence you have to learn from a superior person. It cannot be done by chance. Who has become learned scholar by chance? There is none.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Because that is //śūdra// philosophy, this chance philosophy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Everyone has to work very hard, pass examination, and then he becomes an educated man. Where is by chance one has become learned?

**Pañcadravida:**
What about two people born in the same circumstance? Each has equal education and equal background, but one becomes rich and one remains poor. That's chance.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That is the fate. Fate is the cause. Destiny. Otherwise, so many people are working hard. Why not everyone is becoming rich by chance? //Kālena sarvatra gabhīra-raṁhasā// [[books:sb:1:5:18|[SB 1.5.18]]]. This is the instruction in the //Bhāgavatam. Tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham.// There are two things---happiness and distress---but they are being controlled by the time. You have infected some disease; in time, it will come out, manifested, and the doctor say, "Oh, you infected this disease. Take this injection." The time factor. It... You have to wait to see the result. It is not chance. As soon as you do something, immediately the reaction begins. But you do not see the result immediately, but wait and you'll find. Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
So we say that everything has a cause.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But then we have causeless mercy. So would that be chance?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Madhudviṣa:**
We have also causeless mercy, meeting the pure devotee. Is that a chance?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. I... We don't accept that chance. The causeless is a mercy. Causeless mercy is the cause.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah. The mercy is the cause.

**Prabhupāda:**
The mercy may be causeless, but the mercy is the cause.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But the which is the cause?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The mercy is the cause.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's a cause.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
You did nothing to deserve it, but it's caused your good fortune.

**Trivikrama:**
//Jaya.//

**Satsvarūpa:**
That poet from Ireland asked you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you were in Rome, he said, "I want to know who told God all that He knows, because..."

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Satsvarūpa:**
He asked, "Who... Who has informed God of all knowledge? Everyone has to learn from someone." So he said, "Who informed God?"

**Trivikrama:**
Then Prabhupāda said, "First you have to know what //God// means."

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes, that He's //svarāṭ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
I think that poet was convinced.

**Trivikrama:**
Yes. He admitted that he was confused.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
This philosophy pervades all of modern science.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
This chance theory.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They say that "By chance, after some time..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Because they have finished their science. They have researched and done so many years now, their scientific knowledge is liquidated. Now they are giving this chance theory, therefore, because they cannot explain anything. That's all. Their //vidyā buddhi// is finished. That is the problem now. For the scientists, it is a problem now. Now, so far their limited knowledge is concerned, they have done everything, discovered everything. Now there is no scope of working and discovering. That is the position of the scientists.

**Pañcadravida:**
So they should come to you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, that is another thing. But this is their actual position. Now their position is how to bluff and get money, because talk is finished. Now bluffing stock is now finished. Now they have to give theories like this "chance" and make big, big words, jugglery.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Why don't they make research into consciousness?

**Prabhupāda:**
What they'll be finished? Whatever their limited knowledge they possess, that is finished now. They have no scope.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They should look to the field of consciousness.

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
They are doing it now, but they are studying the brain. They think the brain is the source of consciousness. So they study people...

**Prabhupāda:**
So wherefrom the brain came? What they'll answer?

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
Well, it has evolved.

**Prabhupāda:**
Again by chance. "Brain became by chance." That means failure of their stock.

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
I heard one professor in Berkeley...

**Prabhupāda:**
You..., you prepare brain, or keep something that by chance there will be a brain.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Make a monkey's brain by chance.

**Yaśodānandana:**
In the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in one of your purports, you mention that great scientists like Einstein, Newton and Chandra Bose had such great brains, but who has created their brain?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yaśodānandana:**
This is a very clever argument of Your Divine Grace.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes.

**Yaśodānandana:**
That they will not research.

**Prabhupāda:**
We are appreciating the brain of big, big scientist. But who has created that brain? No appreciation. Just see how fool they are. You cannot create that brain. You create another contemporary brain like that big, big man. Even that big man cannot. The big man, before dying, he should have considered, "Now I'll die now. Let me create another brain like me, and that will work." That they cannot do.

**Pañcadravida:**
So they think chance.

**Prabhupāda:**
So there must be third man, third brain, who has created. You cannot do it.

**Yaśodānandana:**
There is actual proof, Prabhupāda, that when these scientists and great, so-called poets, when they die, refusing to admit the authority of God, they die a very terrible death. Just like in France there used to be a great philosopher named Voltaire, and at the end of his life, because his whole writings and existence he tried to disprove the existence of God, he went insane, and he was eating his own stool and urine. And a priest came to him and said, "Why don't you accept the existence of God? You have become such great poet." He said, "I will never accept the existence of God." But he became to the point where he was eating his own stool and urine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see.

**Yaśodānandana:**
This has been recorded.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the punishment, yes. Punishment there is always. But they are so stubborn fools still.

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
Prabhupāda, the..., one great brain researcher, he spent nineteen years searching for the memory in the brain.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is a story that two friends talking that, on the point that "How this was cut, separated?" So one friend said, "It is by knife." And the other friend said, "No, it was by scissor." So they went on... One said, "No! It is knife." He said, "No! It is scissor." So the knife man was very strong. So he took him to the water, that "You say it is knife; otherwise I shall drown you." [laughter] So he said, "I'll never say." Then he said... When he was drowning, he was doing like this, [Prabhupāda gesticulates] [laughter] "Scissor, scissor." When he was actually drowned, and he had no other means to say, then he was doing like this: "It is scissor. It is scissor." This is their argument. However punished they may be, they'll do this. [laughter] [break]

**Madhudviṣa:**
...that you are too impatient.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Madhudviṣa:**
They will say that you are too impatient. We see that in all science there's been a natural progression. Now they have... In the test tube they have made some tissues, and the tissues are sustaining themselves and are living. So in due course, they'll be able to create some functioning brain.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then what is the use of your creation? It is already created. Why you are, rascal, working? Why?

**Madhudviṣa:**
We can create a better brain...

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Madhudviṣa:**
...by our scientific endeavor.

**Prabhupāda:**
You cannot do even a lesser. How you can expect to do...?

**Trivikrama:**
Post-dated check again.

**Prabhupāda:**
Again the same.

**Madhudviṣa:**
But you must give us some time, because we are working hard in the labratories.

**Prabhupāda:**
I shall. I shall give you kick. [laughter] I shall give you kick. And no time. I shall give you kick.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Well that's not very scientific.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. It is scientific. You are a stubborn... "Scissor philosophy."

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
Most brain researchers admit they could never create a brain.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
Most brain scientists will admit they could never make a brain. Too difficult.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Scissor philosophy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Scissor philosophy.

**Hṛdayānanda:**
Scissor philosophy and the frog philosophy. [break]

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
...something else.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see. They... At last, they'll accept: "Yes, I foolish. Yes."

**Haṁsadūta:**
Then they get a prize.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if I say from the beginning that "You are foolish," I am helping him because he has to admit at the end that he's a foolish.

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
He was one of the biggest brain researchers. He had to admit there was a mind, there was something else other than the brain.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When I was in America, I got one report. One person was telling me they had read of this person. It shows the limit..., how unlimited someone can eat anything. This one man, he has..., he has been for twenty years eating an automobile. He takes the different parts of the automobile, grinding it down, and daily eats different parts of it.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā?// Just see. Madman. There is iron, metal. He was eating?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's eating by grinding it very finely into powder. He's... His program is to consume one entire automobile---tires, windshield, everything.

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
Just so he'll become famous.

**Prabhupāda:**
And how he'll live?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Apparently he takes a little enough quantity that it doesn't disturb. And it's ground down very finely into powder.

**Trivikrama:**
He eats other stuff too.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, he eats other things also, meat.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Also one lady, she was daily eating one glass of dirt.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Soil. One lady was eating soil, one glass, saying it was good for health.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think the goat, the animal the goat, they eat cans. They can eat metal.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes. The pigeons, they can eat stone.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, you once explained how the cow eats grass, and it produces such a rich vitamin food like milk.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
So you asked me the question, "Is there vitamins in the grass?" And obviously there's not such vitamins in grass that it produces milk. So the vitamins are coming from Kṛṣṇa, yes?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Because if you eat grass, considering that there is vitamins---"There is indeed"---then you'll die.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Of course, Karttikeya Mahadeviya...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Mr. Mahadeviya, he might talk upon this point---wheat grass.

**Pañcadravida:**
But cows aren't all eating wheat grass.

**Prabhupāda:**
Cows are eating grass, dry grass, and giving you nice milk. Now, if you eat it---"There is vitamins. Let me eat"---you'll die. So who made this arrangement?

**Gurukṛpā:**
They may argue, though, that even women give milk after there's baby, and they eat all sorts of things.

**Prabhupāda:**
They eat grass?

**Gurukṛpā:**
They eat meat. They eat fish. They are making milk also.

**Prabhupāda:**
Milk is there, but it is not that it is due to eating such and such.

**Pañcadravida:**
Yeah, that doesn't prove anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Milk is there.

**Balavanta:**
If a woman doesn't drink cow's milk, she can't make other milk.

**Madhudviṣa:**
No, they will say that if the cow is fed..., given good feed, then the milk is better.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Madhudviṣa:**
If the cow is given good feed, then the milk is much better.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that I... That I admit. But one thing is that you practically see the cow is eating dry grass and giving you full of vitamins milk. So that does not mean that dry grass is the cause of vitamins. Otherwise you could eat also the dry grass instead of purchasing vitamin pills. Your country is very much fond of vitamin pills. You eat grass. Why you are after vitamin pills? Hmm? Saurabha Prabhu? You can take vitamin pills with grass?

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, we saw a science film in Stanford, and one process of protein synthesis they called "The magic factor."

**Prabhupāda:**
Again, that cau...

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
They didn't...

**Prabhupāda:**
Chance. Magic is also a chance.

**Dharmādhyakṣa:**
So that must have been the Kṛṣṇa factor.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Everything else but Kṛṣṇa. Magic. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
You see the tree, coconut tree, the hard nut and the water. Now, according to scientific idea, there must be pipe, there must be pumping and there must be water. Then you can raise the water. But where is such..., such things? How the water is coming?

**Pañcadravida:**
To the tree?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, on the top, so high. There is no pipe. There is no pump---nothing. You do it. Instead of calling a plumber, you do something that the water will come in this tank.

**Devotee (2):**
Well, they will say that the roots of the tree is bringing the water up.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is a nonsense. You make such root and bring water here. Then your scientific knowledge will be proved. But you cannot do it. Can you do it? We are spending so much money for bringing water. Bring that root and bring water.

**Madhudviṣa:**
We have done better. We can do it faster. Within..., within a few minutes we can bring so much water here. You must...

**Prabhupāda:**
But if I don't pay you, you'll starve. You'll never be able to do it if I don't pay you.

**Madhudviṣa:**
Well, we have money. So we have become more...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you have no money. You have not money. Therefore you are working on my order. You have no money. You have no money.

**Madhudviṣa:**
I know.

**Prabhupāda:**
I know it.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, there was one story in the magazine //National Geographic// of a valuable diamond, the Hope Diamond, the most valuable in the world, was stolen from a deity of Sītā-devī. So every single person that has ever gotten the diamond has been killed.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sītā-devī?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Yes, a deity of Sītā-devī. They stole the diamond from this deity in India.

**Prabhupāda:**
When?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Many years ago.

**Gurukṛpā:**
This diamond is in the Washington...

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Yes. Smithsonian.

**Gurukṛpā:**
...Institute. Washington, D.C. The biggest diamond in the world.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Anyone that's ever stole it's been killed. Everyone is very much afraid now. They can't understand why everyone is dying that has taken the diamond.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Stolen?

**Trivikrama:**
Stolen from India?

**Prabhupāda:**
No... Oh.

**Gurudāsa[?]:**
Rāvaṇa's. Who stole it?

**Madhudviṣa:**
The largest diamond in the world?

**Prabhupāda:**
Well, the Britishers, they stolen so many diamonds from India.

Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: Really?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Trivikrama:**
The whole British Museum.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Whole British Museum means stolen properties from many countries, that's all, especially in India.

**Yaśodānandana:**
Prabhupāda, I have heard that previously in India, some //paṇḍita// says that when they used to put the jewels on the deities they used to put some //mantras,// that when they install the deity, that "Whoever takes this //mantra// will never be able to have peace, or will die," some curse //mantras.//

**Yaśodānandana:**
Whoever steals the jewels.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is possible.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Even just recently they were laughing at this curse, and they took the jewel from Sītā-devī in their car to go to the museum, and their car crashed on the way.

**Pañcadravida:**
Did they die?

**Rādhāvallabha:**
No, they didn't die. A severe crash, though.

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't you think the whole British nation is now ruined?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That has crashed.

**Prabhupāda:**
What do you want more? "But he has not suffered. He has simply died." This is the argument. He has suffered. But "No, no, there was no suffering. He has simply died." What is the more suffering than death? [break]

**Pañcadravida:**
When somebody is dying and his external consciousness is completely absorbed in all kinds of terrible bodily symptoms, how is it that a devotee remembers Kṛṣṇa? What is actually happening that he's able to remember Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Devotee generally remembers Kṛṣṇa. But even if he cannot, Kṛṣṇa will help him.

**Devotees:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is guarantee. //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. Because he is devotee, for material condition he could not remember, but Kṛṣṇa remembers, "Yes," that "he has done so much for Me."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, otherwise...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Otherwise, it's just mechanical.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Mechanical

**Prabhupāda:**
No. That is... That is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that... He was giving the condition. Then, when Arjuna was little disturbed, so He said immediately, "Arjuna, you have no fear." Did you not read this portion?

**Pañcadravida:**
Then... Then that verse, //yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvam// [[books:bg:8:6|[Bg. 8.6]]], is for...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is general. But a devotee, because Kṛṣṇa has taken charge of him, even he does not remember Kṛṣṇa, still, Kṛṣṇa is there.

**Trivikrama:**
"I carry what you lack and..."

**Jayapatākā:**
Kṛṣṇa said, "I am the cause of remembrance and forgetfulness."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Generally devotee dies remembering Kṛṣṇa. Generally. But even if for material condition he cannot, then Kṛṣṇa is taken charge.

**Pañcadravida:**
What was the arrangement with Bharata Mahārāja?

**Prabhupāda:**
And there is no question of hopelessness. No. We have to do our duty very seriously. Then everything is all right.

**Pañcadravida:**
So with Bharata Mahārāja, that was special arrangement?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. It was... It was punishment. He became so much, I mean, attached with the animal that he forgot his duty in devotional service. That is stated. Forgot. He neglected. Therefore he was punished, but he remembered that "I did it."

**Pañcadravida:**
Special mercy.

**Prabhupāda:**
You cannot neglect your duty. Then Kṛṣṇa is always with you. [break] ...way, a soldier is dying in duty, immediately the government takes charge of the whole family. So that is... Why not Kṛṣṇa? [break] //...kṛṣṇa viśvāsa pālana,// Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has said. You know this song? //Avaśya rakṣibe kṛṣṇa viśvāsa pālana.//

**Jayapatākā:**
"If one maintains his faith, then Kṛṣṇa..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah! Yes. One should maintain his faith that "Kṛṣṇa will give me protection. And my duty is to serve Him." That's it.

**Pañcadravida:**
When it says in the //śāstra// that a hundred generations past and future of a devotee, they're liberated, what kind of liberation do they get?

**Devotees:**
Fourteen.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Pañcadravida:**
What kind of liberation does the family get of a pure devotee?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
One who becomes a devotee, the statement is that fourteen generations of his family, past, present and future, become liberated. So what kind of liberation does the family members of a pure Vaiṣṇava get?

**Prabhupāda:**
Liberation means---that is explained by Caitanya Mahāprabhu---to become devotee. That is liberation. To become... To become a devotee is itself liberation. [break] ...will come. //Prasādam?// Is there any such arrangement or not? They are coming. They should be offered some...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
You mentioned the pots of //halavā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The pots of //halavā.// I inquired about it, and they said that semolina is very difficult to get now, that the government has only allotted some eighty pounds of semolina to be purchased.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it doesn't matter, but give him //prasādam,// other //prasādam.// [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] //...halavā// with powdered //dāl// or...

**Pañcadravida:**
Powdered //dāl.// They could use whole wheat flour?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Pañcadravida:**
Whole wheat flour, they could use in?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Devotee (3):**
In right proportions.

**Prabhupāda:**
[boys shout] [aside:] //Jaya.// What they say? What is the quarrel? [break] [//shenai// band playing] ...nice, South Indian.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, very nice. How many seats are there?

**Devotee (4):**
There are about thousand-odd seats, Prabhupāda. Four devotees went from Hyderabad, going through Orissa and coming to Māyāpur for the festival.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Devotee (4):**
Going about five, six months, they have traveled all over.

**Prabhupāda:**
Many people assembled on the way?

**Devotee (4):**
Yes, because they were stopping in every village and distributing literature, giving away //prasādam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[inside display //paṇḍāl//] Hmm. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa. //Jaya.//

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. It is dirty.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very much dust.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
Thousands of people went through last night.

**Madhudviṣa:**
I don't think we can prevent that, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So much traffic.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Foot traffic. I think it should be dusted off.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
The whole display will be cleaned this morning. [break]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Tokyo, Japan, and Philadelphia.

**Balavanta:**
That's Philadelphia.

**Rādhāvallabha:**
That was when you were there, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Oh, yes. [break] Therefore our mission is to bring Māyāpur everywhere.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the greatest peace movement, to bring peace to the suffering humanity.

**Haṁsadūta:**
If a devotee thinks that he likes, for example, Vṛndāvana more than he likes Māyāpur, is that a wrong thinking, or is that his personal...?

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no difference. //Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, yebā jāne cintāmaṇi.//

**Haṁsadūta:**
Just like some devotees, they worship Rāma, and some worship Kṛṣṇa. It is like that?

**Prabhupāda:**
They know there is no difference from Vṛndāvana. They are not so fool.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Not so... [loud //kīrtana//]

**Prabhupāda:**
