Translation: "O the best of great personalities, I am not at all afraid of this material existence because wherever I stay, I am fully absorbed in the thoughts of Your glories and activities. My concern is only for the fools and rascals who are making big, big plans for material happiness, who maintain family, society and so-called love to country. I am simply concerned for them."

This is very important verse for the Vaiṣṇava. Prahlāda Mahārāja said that "I am lamenting," //śoce.// "I am very much aggrieved." //Śoce// means "I am very much lamenting." "Why? Why you are lamenting? I have given you all protection, and your father was giving you so much trouble, and I am always after your protection. Why there is lamenting?" "Lamenting is not for myself. I am quite all right. I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet, and I am engaged in glorifying Your Lordship's activities, so I have no problem. I can sit down anywhere underneath a tree and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and read //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Bhāgavata.// I am quite happy. So I have no problem." "Then? Why //śoce?//" "//Śoce// for these rascals who are making big, big plans to be happy in this material world." This is Vaiṣṇava's... Vaiṣṇava can tolerate all distresses. He is happy in every condition. He has no problem. He has no ambition except serving Kṛṣṇa. Now Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, //na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye// [[books:cc:antya:20:29|[Cc. Antya 20.29, Śikṣāṣṭaka 4]]]. So Vaiṣṇava has no such ambition that "I must have multimillions and million of dollars to possess and must have a very good wife," //na dhanam,// "and many followers. I shall become minister, leader, political." These ambitions are completely kicked out by the Vaiṣṇavas. They have no value. //Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. Those who are after all these things, material temporary happiness, //alpa-medhasām,// Kṛṣṇa says they are lack of brain. But the whole world is after these things.

So those who are after these things... That is the material world, //lābha, pūjā, pratiṣṭhā.// Everyone is for some material profit. That is called //lābha.// And //pūjā. Pūjā// means he wants a position so that all others will come and worship him: "Sir, you are so great. You are big minister. You are big president. You are this, that. Kindly give me this favor, that favor." That is called //pūjā.// "Everyone will come and worship me." And //pratiṣṭhā:// "And I will be so celebrated man that even after my death, there will be a statue in the //maidan// and people will come to worship me." So after death where he is going? He is going to be a dog or cat. He doesn't mind. But his statue should be worshiped. Such rascals. He does not know where he is going after death. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. He'll have to change his body. So as soon as he changes body, he has to accept another body, but he keeps in memory of this body. A drunkard, a woman-hunter, and such a person, most sinful life in this, and what will help him by having a statue? But they are fools, //vimūḍhān,// rascals. //Māyā-sukhāya bharam udva...// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]], making big, big arrangements. That is material world. Everyone is.

So the Vaiṣṇava's duty is... That is Prahlāda Mahārāja's proposal, that "Personally I have no problem. I am begging Your mercy for everyone, not for me, Sir. I am quite sure. Because You are assuring, //mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]], so I have no such //māyā.// I have fully surrendered unto You. And You also promise, //ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. So I am simply fully surrendered unto You. Then as far as I know, I have done it. I shall continue it. So I have no problem." Therefore Vaiṣṇava is worshiped as //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.//

> vāñchā-kalpa-tarubhyaś ca
> kṛpā-sindhubhya eva ca
> patitānāṁ pāvanebhyo
> vaiṣṇavebhyo namo namaḥ
> [Śrī Vaiṣṇava-praṇāti]

//Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// Vaiṣṇava... That is Vaiṣṇava's duty, because they practically see that these rascals are engaged only in false activities which will not help him. They are planning this "ism," that "ism," that "ism," that "ism," simply wasting time, because he knows. He knows, everyone knows, but Vaiṣṇava understands; the non-Vaiṣṇava does not understand. He is a fool. He's a fool, does not understand. When in the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is said clearly, //prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]], "Everyone is under the control of the modes of material nature, //sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa,//" and still, this rascal is thinking that he is independent. //Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ.// And the so-called //yogīs// and //svāmīs// encouraging them, that "Yes, you can go on doing all nonsense. Pay me thirty-five dollars, I will give you //mantra,// and you'll be perfect." This is going on.

So Prahlāda Mahārāja is lamenting for these rascals, the ordinary common man and their so-called rascal guidance, because they cannot guide. They are misguided, because they do not believe in God. They themselves put themselves as God, although he is kicked by the laws of material nature. Even there is pain on the tooth, he immediately goes to the doctor, and he is God. This is going on. And Prahlāda Mahārāja is lamenting for these rascals, //vimūḍhān. Vimūḍha// means... //Vi// means //viśeṣa pūrvaka,// "particularly," and //mūḍha// means "rascal." Not only rascal---"particularly rascal." That is the problem for the Vaiṣṇava. Therefore, following the footprints of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and before that, Prahlāda Mahārāja, Nārada Muni, many, many //ācāryas...// So Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself. He also, He is thinking of these fallen souls. He has come again. First of all He came as Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa said, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You rascal, you are creating so many plans. It will not help you. You just surrender unto Me." He said, but still, we are so rascals, we could not take up the proposal of Kṛṣṇa: "Oh, why shall I surrender? Kṛṣṇa is also as good as I am. I am also a man; He is also man." //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. These rascals, they are so rascal that Kṛṣṇa, because Kṛṣṇa comes to bestow His mercy as human being, they think that "Kṛṣṇa is like me." //Paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto.// The rascal means he does not understand what is Kṛṣṇa, //paraṁ bhāva. Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. And these other rascals, they are declaring that "Kṛṣṇa is dead and gone; now I am Kṛṣṇa." So this is going on.

So that is the problem. For Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement these are the problems. First of all the public is also //vimūḍha,// rascal, and their so-called leaders---political, social, religious and so on, so on, so on, so many leaders---misguiding them. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantrya uru-dāmni baddhāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. Everyone knows that "I am completely under the stringent laws of material nature," and still, they are making plan to become independent. This is their //vimūḍha, vimūḍhaka.// This is their stupidity. Stupidity. They are seeing,

> ahany ahani lokāni
> gacchantīha yama-mandiram
> śeṣāḥ sthitam icchanti kim
> āścaryam ataḥ param

The Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja asked by Dharmaraja that "What is the most wonderful thing in this world?" He said, "This is the most wonderful thing." What is that? //Ahany ahani lokāni gacchantīha yama...// "Every moment people are dying." //Lokāni,// every planet. Not that in this planet there is death; in other planet there is no death. No. Within this material world every planet, either Brahmā or the small, insignificant ant, must die. //Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha doṣānudarśanam// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. Everyone has to die. There is no excuse. So, and still they are planning permanent settlement. So this is their //vimūḍhaka.//

So Prahlāda Mahārāja and every Vaiṣṇava who is actually following the //paramparā// system of Vaiṣṇava duty, they are anxious. Prahlāda Mahārāja says that //śoce tato vimukha-cetasa.// And why they are //vimūḍhān?// Because //vimukha cetasa:// "They don't like You. They don't care for You: 'I don't care for God. I don't accept Kṛṣṇa,' these //vimūḍhas.//" So all the Vaiṣṇavas, especially those who have taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement... Prahlāda Mahārāja will speak later on that "Sir, I am not inclined at all to go alone to Vaikuṇṭha. I must take them all with me. Otherwise I don't want." Prahlāda Mahārāja is devotee. He can ask Kṛṣṇa the power, "Give me such power that along with me I shall take all of them." And that is Vaiṣṇava. He can do so. //Vaiṣṇava ṭhākura, tomāra kukkura, boliyā janaha more.// Therefore we have to become a dog to Vaiṣṇava. //Chādīyā vaiṣṇava sevā, nistar payeche kebā.// Without serving Vaiṣṇava nobody can be delivered, because he is so merciful, he can demand to Kṛṣṇa, "Please, on my sake, please excuse him. I'll take him with me." So Kṛṣṇa grants him, "All right, you take them." That Vaiṣṇava is such...

Therefore we should be very much strictly follower of the Vaiṣṇava principle. Vaiṣṇava's only business is how to deliver these fallen souls. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He appeared as a Vaiṣṇava. The business is to deliver. //Māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvat// [SB 11.5.34]. He was born in a very nice //brāhmaṇa// family, very beautiful body. Everyone liked Him. By His command He could gather hundreds of thousands of people in one night to make civil disobedience movement. He was so popular when He was only twenty or twenty-one years old, and He had His beautiful wife, very affectionate mother, very good position in the society, and still, He gave up everything. Why? //Māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvat,// that "If I do not deliver these fallen souls entrapped in //māyā,// then who will do it?" So that is for this purpose, Kṛṣṇa comes. For this purpose, Caitanya Mahāprabhu comes, the same purpose, as Prahlāda Mahārāja says, //śoce tato vimukha-cetasa vimūḍhān:// "These rascals, they have forgotten You and making plan to be happy." So everyone. Kṛṣṇa also comes: //yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. This is //dharmasya glāniḥ.// When people forget God, that is //dharmasya glāniḥ.// Just like when the people forget the government, do not care for the government, there is chaos, there is chaos. Similarly, when people forget God, Kṛṣṇa, there is chaos. That is the position now all over the world, chaotic condition, because they have purposefully avoided God. Purposefully. In your country it is said, "We trust in God." On the bills it is stated there, "We trust in God." But ask any of the scientists, philosopher, president, that "What is that God? You trust in God, and what is that God? Can you explain?" "No." That means "We trust in air, not in God." Nobody can explain. Such a big country, so many scientists, politicians, philosophers. Ask. Challenge the government that "You write on the bills, currency notes, 'We trust in God.' So what is that God?" Ask anyone. Will they be able to answer? No. It is simply formality.

Similarly, they have completely forgotten God all over the world. There is only little formality still. That also being... In your country, in Europe, so many churches are closed because no one believes in God. Here also I have seen in Nasik so many temples, there the dogs are passing stool and urine within the temple. Nobody goes. Because what there can be done? There are so many rascals, they are making propaganda that "Why do you go to temple?" Just see, here is a central place, it is inhabited by so many respectable persons, but they do not come to temple, because there is regular propaganda that "God is everywhere. Why do you go to the temple?" "No, why God is not there in the temple?" You can answer: "God is everywhere---except in the temple?" Their propaganda is, "God is everywhere. Why do you go to the temple?" But our answer is, "If God is everywhere, why He is not in the temple?" Eh? He must be in the temple. But this rascal will make propaganda, "Don't go to the temple." Of course, there are so many rascals, they came and gone. The temples are going also. In India, by this propaganda that "There is no God in temple," by this false propaganda, the temples are not closed. Still in Vṛndāvana you'll find five thousand temples. You see Jagannātha Purī temple---many thousands of people go there, Raṅganātha temple and so many other temples.

So this India, this propaganda will not stay. They come and go, make propaganda and go away, but temples remain, and it is worshiped. Now the temples are increasing all over the world. Instead of stopping people to go to the temple, the temples are increasing. For centuries past, there was no temple in Europe and America. Now there are hundreds and thousands of temples. So it will increase. You cannot stop Kṛṣṇa's glories. You cannot stop Kṛṣṇa's supremacy. That is not possible. //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. So that cannot be. Therefore it is sure and certain that if you work very sincerely for Kṛṣṇa to spread His message, the message of //Bhagavad-gītā,// there cannot be any check. It is not possible. //Ahaituky apratihatā. Apratihatā// means it cannot be checked by any material condition. You go on with your duty sincerely, there will be no power to check your progress. That is, Prahlāda Mahārāja says. But endeavor must be there, as Prahlāda Mahārāja says.

So we are followers of //mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. Prahlāda Mahārāja is one of the //mahājanas,// out of the twelve //mahājanas.// There are also described, who are //mahājana. Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ.// The indication is there. The question will be, "Who is //mahājana?//" So //mahājana// means... That is also stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, svayambhūr nāradaḥ śaṁbhuḥ kapilaḥ kaumāro manuḥ prahlādaḥ// [[books:sb:6:3:20-21|[SB 6.3.20]]]. So Prahlāda Mahārāja is one of the //mahājanas.// So we are discussing Prahlāda Mahārāja's instruction and his character, his ability. This is Vaiṣṇava. //Bhāgavata// means the glories of the Lord, Bhagavān, and the glories of the devotees---both. There is no difference between Bhagavān and //bhagavad-bhakta.// There is no difference. But that does not mean, like Māyāvādī, that //bhagavad-bhakta// is also God. No. That is explained by Viśvanātha Cakravartī: //sākṣād dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktaḥ. Bhakta bhagavān, bhagavān bhakta.// Vaiṣṇava, he is equally good like God. //Sākṣād dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.// But he's so power... He's more than. Sometimes he's more powerful than Bhagavān. Just like materially, if somebody sees that "This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, is now spread all over the world. Even Caitanya Mahāprabhu could not do it," that does not mean that I am great than Caitanya Mahāprabhu. This does not mean. We are servant. //Kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.// Bhagavān keeps some work to be done by His devotee to give the credit to the devotee. This is Bhagavān. But the //bhakta// never takes the foolishness that he is Bhagavān or greater than Bhagavān. Nobody can be equal to Bhagavān; nobody can be greater than Bhagavān. This is all foolishness.

Prahlāda Mahārāja, he is //bhakta.// He is simply seeking the blessings of the Lord how he can deliver these //vimūḍhān. Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa māyā-sukhāya. Indriyārthe.// These men are so busy. You'll see in big, big cities, they are so busy. What is their end of busy-ness? The end of busy-ness is //māyā-sukhāya.// He'll discuss also later on, //yan maithunādi gṛhamedhi sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. These //grhamedhi,// those who are so much attached to family life and working so hard day and night, what is the attraction? The attraction is //yan maithunādi,// sex, and nothing more. Prahlāda Mahārāja will discuss. So what is this happiness, sex? You cannot enjoy it for long time, and still, for this momentary happiness you are working so hard, forgetting your real business, how to realize God. Are they not //vimūḍhān?// Certainly they are //vimūḍhān.// They do not know what is the interest of life. So Prahlāda Mahārāja is thinking. But these rascals, they are not thinking how they are wasting their valuable time.

Thank you very much.
