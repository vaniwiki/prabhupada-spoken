====== Morning Walk in the Vṛndāvana Municipal Park [partially recorded] ======

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
[Announces] Śrīla Prabhupāda is walking in the Vṛndāvana Municipal Park this morning. He drove here by car in his Mercedes. Now he's taking walk here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Car?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, car is locked, and the driver of the other car is watching it. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...small park, they cannot maintain it. [break]

**Tripurāri:**
...reading in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// the cleansing of the Guṇḍicā temple. And towards the end, one Bengali Vaiṣṇava //brāhmaṇa// washed the feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and He became a little angry, outwardly angry, and unhappy within. And in one purport you mention that the spiritual master should not be offered obeisances or have his feet washed before the Deity. But the impression of most of the devotees has been that in the presence of the spiritual master one can stop worshiping the Deity and offer obeisances to the spiritual master. So I was wondering which is correct.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Dilemma.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
I mean, it's obvious if it was detrimental to our devotional service, then Prabhupāda would correct us.

**Prabhupāda:**
They cannot also keep clean even Central Park. Then what to speak of Vṛndāvana? Things are becoming very, very...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Here in Vṛndāvana the people also pay taxes?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Without tax... [break]

**Tripurāri:**
...in the day sometimes, and now they are giving //prasādam// to the devotees free, without charge. [break] ...stay?

**Prabhupāda:**
They stay at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. [aside:] Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Tripurāri:**
Those are the originals?

**Prabhupāda:**
[aside:] //Jaya. Jaya.// [break]

**Ādi-keśava:**
...the devotees are asking one question. They're wanting to know how it was that even though there is so much distance between, let's say, Govardhana and Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Vṛndāvana, Nanda-grāma, Varṣāṇā, how it was that still Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā could go and meet, and the cowherd boys could go and meet at these various places, they could go such great distances.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is distance for you, not for them. Just like a small ant, it goes from here to here. It is a great, three hundred miles, but for you, one step. Why do you study Kṛṣṇa like you? Why do you think that Kṛṣṇa was like you? //Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. Kṛṣṇa can do anything, so His associates.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
In the //Upadeśāmṛta,// in the translation you refer to this, the //līlā-aṣṭa...//

**Tripurāri:**
//Aṣṭakāla-līlā.//

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
//Aṣṭakāla-līlā.// What is that exactly? Eightfold //līlā// or some...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not eightfold, but..., eight //grahas.//

**Gurudāsa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? So the timings are... At new Govinda temple the...

**Prabhupāda:**
New Govinda temple?

**Gurudāsa:**
New Govinda and old Govinda, both. Starting at 7:30 is the //dhūpa-ārati,// and then, nine o'clock, is another //ārati,// then the //rāja-bhoga ārati// is at 11:30. Gopīnātha's temple is staggered, a little after 7:30, and the Rādhā-ramaṇa temple is 8:30. So they stagger like that. So the next //ārati// will be 7:30.

**Prabhupāda:**
But in the morning, before...

**Gurudāsa:**
Five o'clock. They start at five. The //maṅgala-āratis// start at five. [end]
