====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.9.49 ======

**Śāstrījī:**
[chants slokas] //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// 7.9.49. [chants verse; Prabhupāda and devotees respond] [break]

> naite guṇā na guṇino mahad-ādayo ye 
> sarve manaḥ prabhṛtayaḥ sahadeva-martyāḥ
> ādy-antavanta urugāya vidanti hi tvām 
> evaṁ vimṛśya sudhiyo viramanti śabdāt

[02:38]

Translation: "Neither the three modes of material nature---//sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa//---nor their predominating deities, the five gross elements, the mind, the demigods nor the human beings who are all subjected to birth, death and annihilation can understand Your Lordship. Therefore the wise, spiritually advanced men who have taken to devotional service do not much bother with Vedic study, but rather they engage themselves in practical devotional service."

**Prabhupāda:**

> naite guṇā na guṇino mahad-ādayo ye 
> sarve manaḥ prabhṛtayaḥ sahadeva-martyāḥ
> ādy-antavanta urugāya vidanti hi tvām 
> evaṁ vimṛśya sudhiyo viramanti śabdāt
> [[books:sb:7:9:49|[SB 7.9.49]]]

So //ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tataḥ kim// [Nārada Pañcarātra]. //Viramanti śabdāt.// There are so many prescribed //mantras// for liberation. //Oṁkāra-sarva-vedeṣu.// Every Vedic //mantra// begins with //oṁkāra,// and He is Kṛṣṇa. Vedic //mantra...,// we chant Vedic //mantra.// There are many, many Vedic //mantras// in //Upaniṣad// and //tantras, saṁhitā.// So the begins with the combination of alphabets //a, u, ma---oṁ. Oṁ tad viṣṇuṁ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ// [//Ṛg Veda//]. Everything. //Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// Every Vedic //mantra// begins with the //oṁkāra.// Some of them are very much fond of chanting //oṁkāra// instead of Hare Kṛṣṇa. So there is no objection. Kṛṣṇa says, //praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. //Praṇava// means //oṁkāra.//

So actually only Kṛṣṇa is there, Para-brahman. He is only. //Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.// Expansion in different varieties of multimanifestation. But if we analyze all these things, ultimately we come to the point that Kṛṣṇa is everything. That requires intelligence, how to analyze. Therefore here it is said this manifestation, this material manifestation, is //guṇa guṇino mahad-ādayo, manaḥ,// mind, intelligence, the five gross elements, three subtle elements, all, and manufactured, these demigods, animals, men, //martyāḥ,// 8,400,000 species. So all these varieties, actually it is simply..., they are simply manifestation of Kṛṣṇa's different manifestation of energy, nothing else. The real center point is Kṛṣṇa. This can be understood by advanced students, //bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]], after studying, studying, studying, not only in one life but for many, many lives. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām, jñānavān.// If he actually becomes wise, //jñānavān,// then he understands that only Kṛṣṇa is everything. //Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. That is real understanding.

So as soon as one understands //vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti,// then Vasudeva is there, and I am there. So what is my relationship with Vāsudeva? He is the greatest, greater than the greatest, and I am the smaller than the..., although the quality is the same. I am also //cit,// and Kṛṣṇa is also //cit, sat-cit-ānanda,// and I am also //sat-cit-ānanda// in small part. And because I am a very small particle, I forget my real nature. I identify with this material //mahad-ādayaḥ.// This is fallen down. This is fallen---a spark. Spark is fire, and the big fire is fire, but sometimes it is thrown: "//Phat! Phat!//" It sometimes falls down. So that small particle falls down. The big fire never falls down. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's another name is Acyuta. //Acyuta// means He never falls down. We, a small particle of the //acyuta,// although by nature we are //acyuta,// but due to our weakness we are prone to fall down in this material world. That is our position. But again we can be reinstated in our original position by cultivating Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the position. //Ādy-antavanta urugāya.//

So in this material world there is //ādi, ādy-anta,// beginning and ending. But Kṛṣṇa has no beginning or end. The material... Therefore Kṛṣṇa is not material. //Urugāya.// Kṛṣṇa is //urugāya. Uru// means He is exalted with nice, many, many //ślokas, gāya. Gāya// means songs, poetry. //Uru.// We cannot imagine. //Uru-gāya.// Just like in the //Brahma-saṁhitā: yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ// [Bs. 5.48]. //Loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ.// So this //jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ,// mean BrahmC... //Jagad-aṇḍa. Āṇḍa// means egglike, egg-shaped, this //brahmāṇḍa// or this universe. And there are //jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ,// plural number. So in each universe there is a chief living entity. He is called Brahmā because Brahmā is created first in [indistinct]. So that Brahmā, there are millions of universes, and there are millions of Brahmās and millions of Śiva and other demigods. Each Brahmā is full with all different types of living entities. But such Brahmā, where they are being born? Not only Brahmā, the //brahmāṇḍa. Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti. Niśvasita-kāla.// Just like we exhale and inhale. A minute... Or not minute even: a second. Within a second we exhale and inhale so many times. So similarly, Viṣṇu, Mahā-Viṣṇu, He is also exhaling and inhaling. But during that period so many //brahmāṇḍas// are coming and so many //brahmāṇḍas// disappear. //Ādy-antavanta,// beginning and... But this Mahā-Viṣṇu, who is this Mahā-Viṣṇu? //Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilaja jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ, viṣṇur mahān sa iha yasya kalā-viśeṣo// [Bs. 5.48]. This Mahā-Viṣṇu, from whose breathing so many //brahmandas// and Brahmās are coming and going, that Mahā-Viṣṇu's one second just imagine, how many million millions of years. So this is the description of Mahā-Viṣṇu. Then Mahā-Viṣṇu is also partial incarnation of Saṅkarṣaṇa; the Saṅkarṣaṇa is also emanation from Nārāyaṇa; and Nārāyaṇa is also a emanation from the first //catur-vyūha// Saṅkarṣaṇa. This Saṅkarṣaṇa is expansion of Baladeva, and Baladeva is the immediate expansion of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore come to the Kṛṣṇa. So //ādy-antavanta.//

So beginning is Kṛṣṇa. //Aham ādir hi bhūtānām.// He says, //Bhagavad-gītā. Mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. This is the explanation Kṛṣṇa is giving. //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. We should understand this. So beginning is the Kṛṣṇa, //ādi. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda vigrahaḥ, anādir ādiḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Anādi:// He has no beginning. And everything has got beginning, and //anta,// but Kṛṣṇa has no beginning and //anta. Ādy-anta.// So in this way we have to understand Kṛṣṇa. And one who has such perfect understanding of Kṛṣṇa... And Kṛṣṇa says, //aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]]. //Devānām// means beginning from Brahmā, then Śiva, then so many other demigods, Indra, Candra, Varuṇa. //Aham...// Even Viṣṇu. The Viṣṇu, Kṣirodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, He is also partial expansion of Kṛṣṇa, and from Kṣirodakaśāyī Viṣṇu the Viṣṇu is all-pervading. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]: the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is staying in everyone's core of heart, //hṛd-deśe.// It is... There is no hide and seek, hide and seek. It is clearly stated that "This Paramātmā, Viṣṇu, is staying, //hṛd, hṛd-deśe,// in the heart." Therefore heart is always palpitating. And the //jīvātmā// is also there and... [aside:] Stop children talking. Then when the //jīvātmā// leaves this body, that is called heart failure. That is heart failure. Heart is palpulating, but as soon as the //jīvātmā// goes, heart fails. And these materialist science, they cannot give any cause. They are giving, what is that, oxygen gas and every minute injecting to keep the palpitation of the heart, throbbing of the heart, continuous. But how they can do it? As soon as the living soul is depart from the heart there is no more palpitating. It is simply a lump of matter. That requires intelligence, that this matter is never the living soul.

Therefore anyone who is accepting this body as self, they have been described in the //śāstra// no better than... //Sa eva go-kharaḥ// [SB 10.84.13]. //Go// means cows, and //khara// means asses. These are asses. They are taking so much credit, advancement of scientific knowledge, but so long they do not understand there is soul---//dehino 'smin yathā dehe// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]---they are all asses, that's all, simply asses. This is our challenge, that "You are all asses. If you do not accept the existence of the soul, if you cannot find out where it is, then you are all asses. We don't give you any credit." This is our challenge. Let anyone come. We shall prove that he's an ass. We shall prove. How? It is very easy. Any intelligent man can analyze this body. Take this breathing. What is this breathing? It is air. Now, you are very much anxious to keep the breathing going on by oxygen gas and injection. What is the use of oxygen gas? If breathing is lost, you can put some air within, just like the bellow, and by machine, by some electric arrangement, the bellow can go on and the breathing will come out. Why don't you do that? It is very easy. Anyone can do it. And not anyone; at least one who has got some mechanical idea. So do you think that the breathing will bring the life? Do you think? It is not possible, sir. It is air only. That is not possible. Then you take the blood. What is this blood? The blood is nothing but red water. You cannot say that injecting some red water, you can bring life. Analyze it very intelligently. Then what is the composition of this body? The air or the water, the same. //Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. It is said here, //mahad-ādayo. Mahat-tattva// and its expansion. Even in the subtle mind, //manaḥ prabhṛtayo,// mind, intelligence, egotism, you analyze everything, but you won't find there the life. No. That is not possible.

Therefore, if you are intelligent enough, you take one ingredient of this body. One after another, one after another, one after another, you analyze. You won't find. Neither with that ingredient you can create life. That is not possible. This is analysis. You are very expert in analyzing things in the laboratory and charge fees, chemical analysis. But this is also composition of these chemical. But they say "chemical evolution." That's right, evolution. It has come, life. Then, when life is lost, why don't you combine these chemicals, bring life? That is not possible. Therefore, by proper analysis one must come to the conclusion that these ingredients are different from the living force. Then... That is called self-realization. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi:// "I am not this matter." That is the first step of knowledge. //Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. "Oh, I was so much busy with this lump of matter. Now I understand that I am spirit soul," //ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// This is the first realization, self-realization.

Then,

> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā
> na śocati na kāṅkṣati
> samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu
> mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām
> [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]

Now, after being //brahma-bhūtaḥ,// realizing oneself that "I am not this body, I am spirit soul," he becomes relieved from all these anxieties. Because here in the material world it is full of anxieties because we are identifying with this body. This is the cause of anxiety. But as soon as I realize myself that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul," then all my anxiety is gone. //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. I am always very much anxious to give protection to my body. But we understand that //na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.// Even your body is annihilated, you are not annihilated. That understanding is lacking. One who understands---//na śocati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]. Then there is no fight between one nation to one nation, one animal to one animal, one man to one... There is no more. //Samaḥ sarveṣu.// Because that is the realization that "We are not this body." "I am neither dog, I am not man, I am not this, I am not that. This is all superficial. I am spirit soul. A dog is also spirit soul; the snake is also spirit soul; the tree is also spirit soul." //Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. That is real knowledge, //sama-darśinaḥ.//

Then next stage is that "I am spirit soul, and I am fallen down in this condition. Now I have realized. But wherefrom I am coming?" That is next research work. And then, when he understands by studying ourself, and when he understands from Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa said, //mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]], "I am a //jīva,// living entity. I am part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa," this realization, Brahman realization, Para-brahman realization. Then "I am living force. Then what is my duty?" The duty is the small must render service to the great. This is //bhakti.// This is //bhakti.// You analyze simply. It is the most perfect science, //bhakti-yoga.// That is natural, //bhakti-yoga.// It is not artificial. //Jñāna, karma// or //yoga,// they are all artificial. Simply Caitanya Mahāprabhu begins from this point, //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]].

So if you understand and you begin to serve Kṛṣṇa, then there is no need of studying //Vedas// or this or that. Here it is said, //vimṛśya sudhiyo viramanti śabdāt.// "No more education. //Bās.// First-class education I have got. I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa."

Thank you very much.
