====== Morning Walk [partially recorded] ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...by enjoying this morning’s fresh air.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And if you take bath in the Yamunā, you will get double energy.

**Gurudāsa:**
Hm.

**Prabhupāda:**
These are nature’s gifts. And then we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// It is no [indistinct]. To lead a spiritual life is very easy. [break] ...take photo.

**Gurudāsa:**
Oh, I can do that.

**Prabhupāda:**
All sides.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So if somebody can manufacture by seeing the photograph in Jaipur, that is all right; otherwise, we shall test... [break] ...some marble statues by seeing the model.

**Gurudāsa:**
Hm. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...actual measurement. [break] ...our //gṛhasta// householders, how they are rising early, taking bath in Yamunā, coming to the temple. This is Vedic culture. [break] ...of eating. Western culture means they have early in the morning tea. First of all tea, and, what it is called?

**Devotee:**
Coffee.

**Prabhupāda:**
Coffee, tea, and so many other things.

**Devotee:**
Toast.

**Prabhupāda:**
Toast. And they will..., this evacuation will be stopped, as soon as the belly is loaded. But they are accustomed. After eating, they evacuate. Not easily. [break] [indistinct] ...for sevaites’ sake is for the Kanpur //wala//[?]. Then there is no question of fighting. Otherwise we shall take criminal and civil straight away. [break] Seven hundred.

**Gurudāsa:**
Seven hundred. [break] Renovate these rooms, or just in general?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? General.

**Gurudāsa:**
General.

**Prabhupāda:**
That veranda, that, whatever he likes, we will spend. We’ll pay the bills [indistinct]. [break]

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
But give us the temple portion, free, and purchase the land portion, the balance... [break] ...negotiate, but we have no sufficient men to manage. [break] ...unless you can utilize.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[break] There is fifty //lakhs,// twenty-five //lakhs//---that is beyond us. We can spare up to two //lakhs,// that’s all. [break] You will be able to manage? [break] ...people. [break]

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. The Britishers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Britishers, they train. Just like in India, they trained. They were on the head of the administration. The Viceroy, the government, the secretaries, the military commander, they are all Englishmen; all other, Indians. Therefore Gandhi started the non-cooperation movement, that "These people are ruling over us by //our// cooperation."

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
"So non-cooperate with them, and they will fail." And that was successful. He started non-cooperative movement, that "Don’t cooperate with these Britishers." And when they saw that now full non-cooperation, they left voluntarily. It is not possible to bring so many administrators, military strength, men, and to... Actually this British Empire was expanding through the help of Indians.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes. They did all the work.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
Actually, if the British were more intelligent, they could have continued.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Gurudāsa:**
Just like that mutiny. The grease was used in the guns, and the //brāhmaṇas// mutinied?

**Prabhupāda:**
That is propaganda. Now this is urine?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see nonsense.

**Gurudāsa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who has passed this here? [break] There are other qualities.

**Gurudāsa:**
Truthfulness.

**Prabhupāda:**
Truthfulness and cleanliness. //Satyam śaucam.//

**Gurudāsa:**
//Satyam śaucam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Samaḥ, damaḥ, titikṣā, ārjavam, jñānam, vijñānam.// You do not read //Bhagavad-gītā//---you are publishing for selling? It is read by others. We are simply to make money? These are in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Don’t you read?

**Devotee:**
Yes, I read. The qualities of the //brāhmaṇa// is given. Along with the qualities of all the other //varṇas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
We are taking sacred thread, and have qualities less than //śūdra. Camaras,// cobblers. //Camara// means expert in skin---"I am white," "I am black," "I am this," "I am that." That is //camara.// Exploiting skin. [break] People are very receptive?

**Devotee (2):**
Yes. Especially Gujarati and Marwari communities. The South Indians, they are not so receptive. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] ...men, so everyone should be very alert in their behavior---rising early in the morning, taking bath, be prepared for //maṅgala-ārātrika// immediately. Then class. Everything in regulated way. [break] As soon as one comes to the point "I know everything," he is quiet.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
On the basis of //Bhagavad-gītā,// then nobody can supersede. [break] So now he turns back, all our money invested. He is... [break] If he is prepared to pay double the price, so why not pay the full price, fourteen //lakhs?// We have paid two //lakhs.// Let him pay twelve //lakhs.// And immediately transfer, and we take double price from him. So that... [indisctinct] [break] ...in any way if he is so eager. These are practical. If he is prepared to pay double, why not pay us? [break] [end]
