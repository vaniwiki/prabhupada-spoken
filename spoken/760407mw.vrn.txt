====== Morning Walk in Raṅga Gardens ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with Indians] [break] ...dozen carts.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
It looks like it came from here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...cannot say Hare Kṛṣṇa. There is such competition. [Hindi with others] I like this garden very nice. [Hindi conversation] It is maintained very nicely. We can get flowers. [Hindi conversation] Water is supply there? [Hindi]

**Indian man:**
There are two wells. [Hindi conversation] The river is very near. Just after that garden, Yamunā.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] These people, they like Vṛndāvana. [Hindi conversation] What is our telephone number?

**Akṣayānanda:**
179.

**Indian man:**
179.

**Devotees:**
8.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Vṛndāvana 178.

**Indian man:**
178. [Hindi conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
So they are not trustee. [Hindi conversation] ...are agreeeable. Whatever you think, as you like, we can ex... [break]

**Indian man:**
[Hindi conversation; man mentions monthly donation] [break]

**Tripurāri:**
[laughter] I can remember from //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// one devotee of Lord Rāmacandra was always chanting the name of Rāma, but Lord Caitanya convinced him to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] There is competition like that. One will say "Hare Rāma." Another will say "No, Hare Kṛṣṇa."

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
He was very obstinate.

**Hari-śauri:**
Or that man in Delhi.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Hari-śauri:**
That man in Delhi thought we had something against Lord Rāmacandra.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] There are many versions like that. Somebody will say, "Your Rāmacandra may be very important person, but when Rādhārāṇī goes to Kṛṣṇa, Lord Rāmacandra becomes His [Her] guard with arrows." [laughter] When Rādhārāṇī goes to Kṛṣṇa, and Rāmacandra has to serve Rādhārāṇī with arrows and bows.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
This is //gorur.//[?]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
What is that six-pointed star significance?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Cakra.//

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh.

**Hari-śauri:**
What is the symbol on the right-hand side, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
I think //śaṅkha.//

**Hari-śauri:**
Is that the conch, is it? [break]

**Akṣayānanda:**
...thread from the Deity, the old sacred thread, and they tie it on their wrist. They tie it here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Some of the devotees have started to do that now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Akṣayānanda:**
I don't know. It's just like wearing beads. The sacred thread from the Deity, after replacing, they take the old one and they wear it here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who has told them?

**Akṣayānanda:**
I don't know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why you...?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Well, I told one boy to stop it, and because I couldn't quote any authority, he keeps wearing...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, there is no author... Where is his authority?

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
This nonsense should be stopped.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, I thought it was wrong. That's why I mentioned it. I wanted to make sure.

**Prabhupāda:**
Stop this.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Okay. Sure.

**Hari-śauri:**
I think their idea is that because it's //prasādam,// it's from the Deity, that they're able to wear it like that.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is another concoction. The sacred thread is not used like that, in the hand.

**Akṣayānanda:**
I thought it was wrong. It seems like some kind of fashion or something, concocted fashion. [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
...small black beads that the devotees are wearing from Rādhā-kuṇḍa. They have a string of beads made of clay from Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Are they...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Rādhā-kuṇḍa clay is not bad.

**Hari-śauri:**
So it's all right to wear them?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not very constantly.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Sometimes I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you're worried that one thing will lead to the next. Actually, all we have to do is follow your example.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, we don't have to add anything. What can we add?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
What is the use of it?

**Akṣayānanda:**
What can we add?

**Prabhupāda:**
There is a proverb in Bengali that the crows, they eat stool. But when the crow is very young, he eats more stool. [break] ...tendency always, how to become hippie as soon as there is little opportunity.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, it's something we have to guard against very carefully.

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't allow them. Don't allow all these.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Even in India people say like that: "Oh, you are hippies?"

**Prabhupāda:**
As soon as you become hippie, immediately your all prestige will go.

**Akṣayānanda:**
Finished, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very carefully.

**Hari-śauri:**
The thing is, a lot of the devotees, they're not very much conscious that they're being watched by the..., very carefully by the public. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[bird is singing nearby] Bird of paradise? No.

**Hari-śauri:**
No, the bird of paradise is different.

**Prabhupāda:**
Different. [end]
