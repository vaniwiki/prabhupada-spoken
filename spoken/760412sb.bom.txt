**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [chants verse; devotees respond] [break]

[01:23]

Translation: "Nārada Muni continued to speak that the student should completely practice how to control the senses, be submissive. Firmly in friendly attitude upon the spiritual master, with great vow, the //brahmacārī// should live at //gurukula// only for the benefit of the //guru.//"

**Prabhupāda:**

So as it is stated that human life is meant for //tapasya,// austerity. //Tapasā. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattva// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]], that this human form of life is meant for //tapasya,// not to live like cats and dogs. That is not human form of life. And //tapasya,// austerity, begins from //brahmācārya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena vā// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. This is //tapasya. Brahmācārya// means restraining sex life, celibacy. That is //brahmācārya.// So when one is serious about advancement of spiritual consciousness, he must live under the control of the //guru// to learn how to become //brahmacārī.// This is the main purpose.

The whole Vedic civilization is on the basis of controlling the senses. The //yoga// practice, it is also meant for controlling the senses. //Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ.// By some artificial bodily exercise one can control the senses. That is called //yoga.// But one who becomes directly a devotee, his sense control is automatically done, if he is devotee. //Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. If one is devotee, then he does not like anything material. And the sex enjoyment is the topmost pleasure in this material world. So naturally one who is devotee, he doesn't require to practice //brahmācārya// separately---//paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate// [[books:bg:2:59|[Bg. 2.59]]]---because sex pleasure may be very nice in this material world, but when one gets a sense of spiritual pleasure, then this pleasure becomes abominable. It is said by Yamunācārya,

> yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor
> nava-nava-dhāmany rantum āsīt
> tad-avadhi bata nārī-saṅgame 
> bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca

"Since I have begun to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness and getting relish, then, since then, when I think of...," //bata nārī-saṅgame,// "sex pleasure with woman, I spit on it and my mouth becomes curved, 'Eh,' like that."

Actually it is the position, but because we are under the spell of //māyā,// we are captivated, bewildered, that after sex life, not only human being, but anyone who is living within this material world, beginning from Brahmā down to the smallest insect, everyone is after sex life. We have heard that even Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, they became sexually excited. It is said that Lord Brahmā was enchanted by daughter, what to speak of others. This material world is so, I mean to say, bewildering, that sometimes the first-class person also becomes bewildered by sex life. Therefore it is strictly prohibited that one should not remain in a solitary place with woman even though the woman is mother, sister or daughter. This is the injunction of the //śāstra.//

> mātrā svasrā duhitrā vā
> nāviviktāsano bhavet
> balavān indriya-grāmo
> vidvāṁsam api karṣati
> [[books:sb:9:19:17|[SB 9.19.17]]].

This is the order, that //mātrā... Mātrā// means "along with mother"; //svasrā// mean "along with sister"; and //duhitrā// means "along with daughter." "One should not sit down in a solitary place even with mother, sister or daughter."

So one may be surprised, that "Nobody becomes agitated sitting before mother, sister or daughter." But //śāstra// says, "No, no. They are agitated." Then you can say, "Maybe agitates some fool rascal." "No." //Vidvaṁsam api karṣati:// "Even though one is very advanced, learned, they also become agitated." Therefore you should be very, very careful. Very, very careful. And another place is, another... Just like in our Society, compulsorily we have to mix with women---not only women, very beautiful young girls. But if one is not agitated even in this association of beautiful women and girls, then he is to be considered //paramahaṁsa.// He is very advanced. Those who are not... //Paramahaṁsa// means he's above all these material qualities.

So we cannot avoid in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. That was the problem from the very beginning. In India there is restriction between men and women, free intermingling, but in your country there is no such restriction. Therefore I got my disciples married. They criticize me that I have become a marriage-maker. Anyway, I wanted at least to regulate. That is required. //Dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi// [[books:bg:7:11|[Bg. 7.11]]]. Kṛṣṇa also says. Now, a married man also can be //brahmacārī.// If a married man stick to one wife, and before sex, if he takes permission from his spiritual master, then he is //brahmacārī.// Not whimsically. When the spiritual master orders him that "Now you can beget a child," then he is //brahmacārī.// Śrīla Vīrarāghavācārya, he has described in his comment that there are two kinds of //brahmacārī.// One //brahmacārī// is //naiṣṭhikī-brahmacārī;// he doesn't marry. And another //brahmacārī// is... Although he marries, he is fully under control of the spiritual master, even for sex. That is... He is also //brahmacārī.//

So why so much restriction on the sex life? It is... The people do not understand throughout the whole world. They are captivated by sex life, especially in the Western countries. //Puṁsaṁ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etat.// Material existence means a desire of sex life, both man and woman. //Puṁsaṁ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etat.// Not only in human society, in animal society, in bird society, everywhere, that is material life. //Tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim āhuḥ// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. And when they are united for this purpose, a man and woman, they... We are already attached to the material activities. Then our attachment becomes more and more strong. //Tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim āhuḥ.// Then, out of this attachment, //ataḥ gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta vittair janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. In this way, being united, then they want //gṛha,// apartment, to live together. Then they want some land. Formerly there was no service; the //gṛhastha// used to produce the food grains from the land. Neither there was factories or big, big offices to get job. One had to produce his own food from the land. So simply apartment will not help; I must require some land for eating. //Gṛha-kṣetra-sūta.// Then we desire for some children. //Sūta, āpta,// then friends. //Sūta, āpta. Ataḥ gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta vittaiḥ.// But all these establishment can be maintained by money only. Then money. Then, in this way, gradually, //janasya moho 'ham.// We are already bewildered. We are attached to this material world. But when we are united, man and woman together, our attachment for this material world becomes increased. //Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. Material world mean "I am this body, and in relationship with this body everything is mine," this conception. They forget altogether that "Nothing is mine. Even this body is not mine. Even I am not mine. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's." That is wanted. Unless we get to that status of life, that "Nothing belongs to me. This body also belongs to Kṛṣṇa; I, as spirit soul, belong to Kṛṣṇa; and everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa...," then we become liberated. //Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]].

This human form of life is meant for //tapasya,// to learn how to become detached from this material world. And the beginning is this //brahmacārī// life. //Brahmacārī gurukule vasan dāntaḥ. Dānta// means self-controlled. That is real teaching. Either a //gṛhastha// lives... If a //gṛhastha// lives, even he has got wife, he does not... One side, according to Vedic civilization, there is no sex life except for begetting a nice child, and that also with //garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.// In other words, whimsically sex life is completely stopped in Vedic civilization. There everything under regulation. Therefore //brahmacārī// means how to control the senses, to keep under his own control. Not that "I am now sexually inclined. I must have immediately sex." No. //Dānta.// That is taught. Just like in our Society, even //gṛhastha,// he is also under restriction, and what to speak of //brahmacārī.// But we should always remember that this human life is meant for controlling the senses. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// It is simply meant for inquiring about our spiritual life. That is perfect civilization.

Therefore //brahmacārī// means living under direction of //guru, guror hitam.// And //guror hitam:// how he can be simply thinking of benefiting the spiritual master. Unless that position comes, nobody can serve //guru.// It is not an artificial thing. The //brahmacārī,// the disciple, must have genuine love for //guru.// Then he can be under his control. Otherwise why one should be under the control of another person? Therefore it is said, //ācaran dāsavat. Dāsa. Dāsa// means servant. Not only servant, but menial servant. Menial servant means just like the sweeper, the cobbler, like that. They are called menial servant. So in India there is system. The sweeper class is different, the cobbler class is different, and domestic servant is different, and the barber, he is also servant, different. The washerman, he is also servant. So //nīca// means just like the washerman or the barber or the cobbler. They are less than the domestic servant at home. They are //śūdras,// and they are considered less than the //śūdras, pañcama.// So a disciple is expected to live in //gurukula// or---//gurukula// means at the shelter of //guru---nīcavat,// menial servant. Menial servant. //Nīcavat. Ācaran dāsavan nīco gurau sudṛdha sauhṛdaḥ// [[books:sb:7:12:1|[SB 7.12.1]]]. This can be possible when one is very thickly related with the //guru.// Otherwise, ordinary relationship will not do. One who has got actually the conviction, //yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo...// One who is convinced that "If I can please my //guru,// then Kṛṣṇa will be pleased." This is called //sudṛdha,// full faith. //Yasya prasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.// "And if I displease my //guru,// then I have no place." In this way... Of course, //guru// cannot be a false //guru.// False //guru// has no such thing. If one //guru// is genuine and the disciple is genuine, then both of them are benefited, and they go back to home, back to Godhead.

Thank you very much.
