====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
First business, how to get our books. [indistinct] [loud //kirtan// in background] For Russia, export from India will be favorable. So government paper we are printing seven, eight rupees price. Make that addition, all the books. Ask them to take paper from the government, huge quantity, and all these books should be published immediately, five thousand copies.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Five thousand copies each.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, if possible. Minimum one thousand.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Last time when we were speaking, I was mentioning to you that in Russia they are particularly inclined towards an exchange program of books, where we give our books and they will give some useless books.

**Prabhupāda:**
So [indistinct], why should we do this?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You mentioned last time you will throw them away.

**Prabhupāda:**
For us there is no readable books in the whole world.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
We cannot waste our time.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, of course. But is there any... I mean, of course we would like to...

**Prabhupāda:**
But only some of the authorized books, just to take their parts and to refute; otherwise, we haven't got to take lesson from anyone.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is a fact. All rascal speculators, what value they have got?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Supposing there are many thousands of libraries in Russia and they are agreeable to placing, say, one of our books of each book in each of the libraries, but they are not willing to purchase all of these books, but they are willing to give us some book in exchange? Will we make this sacrifice? Because it will represent a loss of money.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, if you can arrange for selling those books at any cost.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can arrange to sell our books to them at any cost?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, exchange.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can sell. There is some set resale value. Then we can realize some money.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, then it is all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They'll have value. There will be some money. We can request them to send us samples of the books that they will return to us. Then we can...

**Prabhupāda:**
Find out cost. Some shopkeepers, stores. Some return. If we can get our cost price of the books.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We should get cost price.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not should, but must as far as possible.

**Gurukṛpā:**
I've heard that in Russia the people are so eager to read imported literature that any literature appears they immediately buy it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's a black market going on in Russia, particularly black market on books. Books are smuggled into the country and sold, and they're very dearly read. People are very anxious.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They must be, because they are keeping in darkness.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
These nasty countries, in the name of giving them material facility, they'll kill them, even they're independent. Such a horrible country. How people can tolerate loss of independence? It is very horrible. I am sitting here twenty-four hours, this is another thing; but if I understand that I cannot go out, I have to sit down here, oh, it is horrible. It is a horrible condition. Simply this impression that I have to keep myself within this room, although I am keeping myself, I am not going, only for walk maybe. But if the impression is that I cannot go out from this room, then my life is lost. This is psychology. So they are keeping their young men. They are not allowed to go out of the country, in Russia. Similarly in China.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Even more so.

**Prabhupāda:**
So what kind of government it is? It is a horrible government. And they are hackney only in literature. These Communist country, the people are forced to accept the government regulation. And that is all bad. I have seen in Moscow, generally the people are morose, their face not very happy. They are also European. They want freedom to go here and there. They have no such freedom. And poor. The taxi driver---first of all there is scarcity of taxi; you cannot get taxi.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Even in Moscow, big city.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That Professor Kotovsky, I asked him, "Please arrange for a taxi." [indistinct] "Well, Swāmījī, this is Moscow." [laughter] So he came down up to the gate---he was very virtuous---he showed me, "Swāmījī, you go this way, three, four lane, then you'll find a short lane, and then you go this way, this way, then you get to your hotel." He showed me some short cut, personally. They... He could not call a taxi. And somewhere we went, we got a taxi, private taxi, and that man was begging for more than the fare.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That means the system...

**Prabhupāda:**
"Can you not give me little more?"

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That means the system is a failure.

**Prabhupāda:**
And then I could understand. And they have got that there is tourist bus, taking here and there, that bus is third class. Even less opulent than in India.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many days were you there?

**Prabhupāda:**
One week.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Short. You were only in Moscow?

**Gurukṛpā:**
That is the rich city. People are fighting to get into that city. They only allow so many people to live there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything restricted.

**Gurukṛpā:**
You cannot just decide to move to Moscow. You cannot do that. You must take permission from the government to live in Moscow.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything..., and we could not get nice food. There was no nice rice, wheat, fruit, flour---nothing. Fruit means the strawberries.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Only.

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't remember we could get any other fruit.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Perhaps you went at a bad season.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Everything is controlled. Whatever government will give you, you have to accept. And all the stores, it is just like, what is called? The old?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Grocery store?

**Prabhupāda:**
Antique, antique. Antique shop. That means no purchaser. People have no p..., no bank. People have no money; simply bare necessities of life their government supplies. And bus transport, buses standing in one place, best time, and people are running after. Women, men, mostly they walk.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Or bicycles.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bicycle, I did not...

**Gurukṛpā:**
I think they must all wear the same clothes.

**Prabhupāda:**
I did not study so much. Yes, there is no gorgeousness.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In China they all wear the same clothes. Whatever you saw in Russia, China is ten times more oppressive. It is much more oppressive. They say that Russia is a complete failure, because they are allowing so much looseness. The Chinese are accusing the Russians of being very loose and very capitalistic inclined. China is very dissatisfied that Russians have given up the principles of Marx and they have taken after the Western ways, preferring one group above another group.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because Russia was afraid of another Revolution. People were preparing. So much pressure, intolerance, after all they are Europeans, so there was a chance of revolution.

**Hari-śauri:**
Especially after Stalin. So many people were killed and sent to prison camps. That was the way that they enforced...

**Prabhupāda:**
Stalin is calculated to be greatest criminal in the world. He has killed so many men. All rogues. We were taken through the neighborhood of all aristocratic men who were killed in the Revolution.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
While reading about China, one of the books I was reading also described Cambodia, Vietnam and Korea. And the recent histories of these countries are so horrible, that the... Mostly in that part of the world now they have become totally anti-American. They are very, very anti-American because of what the Ameri... The Americans have simply gone there and...

**Gurukṛpā:**
Not Korea.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Huh?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, Korea, also there was Americans.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
North Koreans don't love Americans.

**Gurukṛpā:**
No, not north Koreans, South Koreans.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But now Korea is united.

**Gurukṛpā:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes, I've been reading. They hate the Americans in North Korea. In North Korea they hate the Americans.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ācchā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
North Korea is Communist.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Trivikrama has left Korea now. He went, and he has left. He's in Japan.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. He could not do anything?

**Gurukṛpā:**
I don't know. He has left there. He went for three weeks and left. Now he's in Japan. I don't know where. He's doing something.

**Prabhupāda:**
If he could not do anything, he can come back to America. What do you think?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think that it's good for him to come back to America. He's been away from America for five or six years now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, let him come back.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He can preach in colleges. It would be a very purifying experience. Being by oneself for so long in that part of the world is very difficult.

**Prabhupāda:**
To remain alone is risky.

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Now China wants to control India.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And also Russia.

**Prabhupāda:**
Also Russia. China would have attacked. They once attempted, American implemented. They are thinking that because the officers are corrupt, the people are dissatisfied, and if we go they will welcome.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Exactly correct. Oh, yes, it's a perfect analysis.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They believe that the... Of course, it's a fact, the leaders are very corrupt, but the people want the change, that's what they believe. "And if we go, the people will work with us and overthrow this government and establish a true communistic government, a government for all of the benefit of the people." That's their idea. They feel that way about the whole world, the Chinese. They feel in America also---of course that's nonsense---but they think like that, that in America there is a huge working class, and the working class are feeling oppressed. But that's nonsense.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think American working class are paid more than any country.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The average income in the United States now...

**Gurukṛpā:**
Even a bricklayer. You know a man who lays bricks, a man who just lays bricks, bricklayer? In India he gets paid ten rupees a day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Utmost.

**Gurukṛpā:**
And here he gets paid twelve dollars an hour.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bricklayer.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, twelve dollars an hour.

**Gurukṛpā:**
So one hundred dollars a day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, it is impossible to engage.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yeah.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Very expensive. Construction worker, just to build a simple building, they charge construction about nine dollars an hour, every man, minimum, unskilled man, nine dollars an hour.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then, how it will be possible?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We were discussing this. The way to do it is that you get some person... There are many persons all over the country who are knowledgeable, who can do the work, but who are friendly. Just like in many temples that I visited, they have people, professionals who are working, but they are young men, and because they are friendly towards our Society, they'll do the work for less money. I'm sure that there are people who can be found like that here.

**Prabhupāda:**
American devotee, Asian and Australian devotee.

**Gurukṛpā:**
I think it can be done amongst our devotees.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. We are not very anxious to get it done immediately. We shall do slowly.

**Gurukṛpā:**
So we are... Me and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, we have organized the //saṅkīrtana// here. The //saṅkīrtana// should increase about ten times. Before they were doing three hundred dollars a day; now they should be doing at about one thousand three hundred dollars a day.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Therefore I think if we have profit, fifty percent can go for books and fifty percent can be banked. And when they have enough money, then we can build the temple. But it's the only question...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, with what..., whatever collection is there, fifty percent, go on. Why wait?

**Gurukṛpā:**
And what about my collections in Japan?

**Prabhupāda:**
We also spend here for the time.

**Gurukṛpā:**
'Cause I will be getting nice collections this year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurukṛpā:**
I will bank it here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gurukṛpā:**
It should come here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The construction in Māyāpur...

**Gurukṛpā:**
It's just that I don't have...

**Prabhupāda:**
You have paid?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
From Rādhā-Dāmodara party?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We were doing that, previous to the Māyāpur festival.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You are also, you have promised you have continued. There is no temple. Must be constructed.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Do you think... Some of the devotees were expressing that maybe in the front would be better, then they could come in off the street. Otherwise they have to go around the...

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Gurukṛpā:**
If the building was built in the front, some people were thinking this might be a better spot, because if there's no sun back here...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Gurukṛpā:**
...then it becomes very muddy there.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the area here?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Oh, it's bigger.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bigger?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Yes. And they say these neighbors back here are the ones that do all the complaining. So some were expressing that this might be better; they could come in off the street. Also, many tourists come to Hawaii, and if we make it very nice, then they can..., many tourist buses may come here to see the temple. So if it is near the gate then you'll come right out. But it's just that I have no knowledge of how to build anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Myself, how to go about it. I don't have any experience or knowledge of that.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, you have no experience. I know. So that Australian boy who works constantly, there is one temple...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhāskara.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Bhāskara, yeah. He's in New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
He can come and help.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He'll be free pretty soon.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Someone has to organize for the construction, though. That's the main thing. Then later the inside.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Māyāpur they are completing the, er, that building? They had begun that long residential building.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which one?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The one while we were there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Uhuh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I remember they were doing the first..., ground floor. I think you told them to...

**Prabhupāda:**
They are completing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What about the other side?

**Prabhupāda:**
That side also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Exhibition hall.

**Prabhupāda:**
That side also scheduled to begin.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And Bombay also has to be finished.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So sufficient funds have to be sent for completing Bombay in ten months' time and for those two buildings in Māyāpur.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bombay, the slab is laid [late?], temple. Latest letter?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
Giridhārī. And the tower, [indistinct].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Really?

**Prabhupāda:**
I think it will be finished earlier.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya.// Any more news on the attempt of the government to take it back?

**Prabhupāda:**
The government, I know it will be unable to take. They cannot acquire temple. There is no such law. And even they acquire, we shall say, "All right take it. [indistinct]." And the Hindus will... [indistinct] ...to neglect, "All right, we will do it."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We could write a book. A book should be written about the Bombay...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that... One lady, Nirmala.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Dr. Singhal's wife.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, she has already sent some article, why it is not published?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, whenever I see her she asks, "Why they don't publish?"

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, and they inquire.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So we should start to make enquiry now throughout the world, how to push these books forward. Just as you are pointing out---sending books from India to Russia---in this way there may be so many arrangements.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Just find out what is the venues to push our books. As much as possible.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should I concentrate my time for this?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, only. This will be your only business. All over the world, see how the books can be pushed. In their language or in English. Now we have got several languages. You have seen the latest Portuguese edition?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Spanish.

**Prabhupāda:**
Spanish. You have seen?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't think I have.

**Prabhupāda:**
Give it to him.

**Hari-śauri:**
It's on the bottom shelf.

**Prabhupāda:**
Last.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This one?

**Prabhupāda:**
Last, last book. Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Phew, very handsome.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they have done very nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. That's the idea. If books like this can be introduced, I'm certain that every single Spanish embassy around the world will take a book like this for their library. And there's plenty of them. There's many nations.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you can sell standing order of all the languages. So they will take. And the get-up is so nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Beautiful. Yeah, that book is nice, the color is good.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is printed in America also. American books.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Printed in...

**Dhṛṣṭadyumna:**
EUA.

**Prabhupāda:**
USA.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
USA.

**Prabhupāda:**
In this way, if possible, print in Russian language, in black market.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, that's possible, and they'll be eager.

**Dhṛṣṭadyumna:**
The young people are dissatisfied, young student.

**Prabhupāda:**
Small books print, first of all. See how the black market takes it, and then big books.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There is also all of the Eastern European countries.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, they have got black market. There must be intermediate man who deals in black market.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There is.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Give them. Let them make good profit. We want to put up, that's all. And let them take money, we don't mind. //Śaṭhe śaṭhuṁ samācaret.// When there is trickery, you become trickery. //Śaṭhe śaṭhuṁ samācaret.// Kṛṣṇa's play, those who are plain, Kṛṣṇa is very kind and plain. Those who are tricky, "All right, I am also tricky." We shall adopt all the means of the materialistic person, simply for Kṛṣṇa. [break] Just like Kṛṣṇa's //rāsa// dance. Any materialistic person at the dead of night will be glad to dance with young girls. What is the difference? [break] But because it was Kṛṣṇa's dancing, so this association of the woman with Kṛṣṇa is taken by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the first-class worship. //Ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā.// Kṛṣṇa also became a little tricky with the //gopīs,// "Oh, you have come at dead of night? What your husband, father would think? And there are so many ferocious animals in the jungle. Please get out immediately." You have read that?

**Devotees:**
Mmm. Hmm.

**Prabhupāda:**
And the //gopīs// were thinking, "What this rascal says..., say?" [chuckles] They are so sorry, that "We have come, leaving everything and this rascal is giving us moral instruction." This is love: they can chastise Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...somehow or other, black market, white market, red market, let them make. And as soon as there is taste, there will be very good demand. And this black marketeer will make profit and they'll do. This Chinese policy or the Russian policy will not stand. Simply we require to make ourselves strong. As soon as we become stronger than the Communist movement, we shall finish everyone.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Finish everyone?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You mean attack them?

**Prabhupāda:**
That I shall tell later. You become little strong. We cannot allow them. Because Kṛṣṇa's policy is, //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtam// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. You have to take that policy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Vṛndāvana, one day on a walk, you were saying that Kṛṣṇa's soldiers will walk all over the world, and they will approach everyone and say, "Do you believe in Kṛṣṇa?" And if they say, "No," immediately, kill them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Not kill them with weapon, but kill them by //saṅkīrtana.// They are already dead. So physically killing is for very big, big, strong man like Mao, or this Lenin, like that. Not common people. They have to be shown mercy.

**Hari-śauri:**
More a question of revival for the common people. More a question of revival.

**Prabhupāda:**
If they allow us to forward our movement, then we are satisfied. And when there is hindrance, the person who is hindering, finished. But don't do it now, [chuckles] then you will be finished.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Do you think the time will come when we will...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Because Kṛṣṇa has two business: //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtam// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. We are for delivering all people. Anyone who will put hindrance, then we have to finish. Not small; big. Yes. That is going on all over the world, politics.

**Gurukṛpā:**
Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, he also...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the way everywhere. [break] They will be automatically finished. Just like the Ramakrishna Mission, who are advertising that they have done wonderful importance. They are now finished. They are simply making false propaganda in India. Actually, they have got fangs. What is called, fangs?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Phans?

**Prabhupāda:**
The poison teeth?

**Devotees:**
Fangs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fangs, fangs. That is broken. So make... First of all try to push books everywhere, all over the world. They have got so many languages, like Russian or... Black market. Chinese also. Black market, they cannot check.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, no, and you don't need permission either.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And there's more profit, too.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In black market.

**Prabhupāda:**
And yes, if there is demand, then you will make good profit also. And there will be demand.

**Hari-śauri:**
They'll be big demand for your books.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very big, very big.

**Prabhupāda:**
They trans..., sent one translation of Tulasi dāsa's //Rāma-caritra-mānasa.// It was sold, all, in a week. And therefore they have stopped now.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Wow, really?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gurukṛpā:**
It is //Bhagavad-gītā// and //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
They sent stocks, //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sometimes I wonder that---of course, we want our books to be translated by our own men---but in the absence of sufficient translators...

**Prabhupāda:**
Any way. That thing, you see, that our men means they know the philosophy. Others, they do not know. That is the difficulty.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Supposing we have---I'm just using this hypothetical...

**Prabhupāda:**
Any, "our man" who knows Russian language, he should check.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Professionals may translate, but one of our men may check?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, just like our books are being done in Germany now.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Yeah, then you can have quite a few books translated. Because if we only depend on our men for the entire translating work, it will never get done.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Then get professional man, but he may not create the havoc[?].

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, he must be checked by someone who knows. Whew, this is exciting. I'd love to see your //Bhagavad-gītā,// the most widely-read black market book in Russia.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then that will create revolution.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Whew. These books are very revolutionary. You are very strong. You have put everything in a very clear-cut, strong words. You have attacked everyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious as fools and rascals.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] This is a fact. It is not exaggeration.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In your article in //Back to Godhead// about Marx, you call him a... What is that?

**Gurukṛpā:**
Nonsense.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
A nonsense. You call him "Marx is nonsense."

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, what is his philosophy? Dialectitude?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dialectic Materialism.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, we have written one Dialectic Spiritualism.

**Hari-śauri:**
Harikeśa's.

**Prabhupāda:**
Harikeśa.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, he read it to us in India. He's preaching, I think, in Eastern Europe sometimes. We got a report. Has he written you?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I heard that, but is he being all right or not?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
From the report it appears that he goes occasionally into some Eastern European countries. Mostly he's concentrating in England, Germany and Scandinavias. He has a party, and they are doing speaking engagements and distributing books. And sometimes he went in..., which countries?

**Dhṛṣṭadyumna:**
Czechoslovakia, Hungary. He went to Budapest.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He is going to some Communist European countries.

**Dhṛṣṭadyumna:**
They make their vans with false bottoms, and they hide the books underneath, so at the border they do not see. Underneath the van is all your books. When they get in the country then they distribute the books to these students.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Revolution.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is very nice.

**Dhṛṣṭadyumna:**
Sometimes he said when he's speaking, the translator will not say what he is saying because it's...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sometimes he forgets---usually he speaks very carefully, guarded words. But once or twice he says..., he starts speaking direct Krishna consciousness, and the translator looks at him and won't translate it into the local language. Sometimes he forgets himself and starts speaking about Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the translator suddenly looks at him. Usually he covers everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
He has done a good job.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He is a fit person, very intelligent.

**Prabhupāda:**
So in this way... You are all intelligent; you can plan. The aim is how to distribute books. That is first consideration. [break] In //Bhāgavata// it is very figuratively described that we have got this body and the different parts. Just like Arjuna is sitting on the chariot. There is chariot driver, there are horses, reins, there is wheel, and the arrow and the bow. They have been figuratively... So this can be used for killing the enemies of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and then give up all this paraphernalia, chariot, wheel. Just like after fighting, only victory, then you kill them. And similarly this body is there, the mind is there, the senses are there. So utilize it for conquering over this material existence. And then give up your body and go back to home.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Does the devotee... I mean, just like you are always enthusing us to push on...

**Prabhupāda:**
That is sharpening your weapons. That is also described. By serving the spiritual master, you keep your weapon always sharpened. And then take help from Kṛṣṇa, the words of spiritual master sharpen weapon, and //yasya prasādad bhagavata...,// and the spiritual master is happy, then Kṛṣṇa immediately will help. He gives you strength. Suppose you have got a sword, sharpened sword. But if you have no strength, what will you do with the sword? Kṛṣṇa will give you the strength, how to fight and kill the enemies. Everything is described. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]. Make your weapon sharpened by the instruction of the spiritual master, and then Kṛṣṇa will give you strength, you'll be able to conquer. This figurative explanation I think last night I give. Here is a verse, //acyuta-balaḥ, acyuta-balaḥ// [[books:sb:7:15:45|[SB 7.15.45]]]. Is Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa here?

**Hari-śauri:**
[calls out] Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa?

**Prabhupāda:**
We are soldiers of Kṛṣṇa, servant of Arjuna. Simply we have to act accordingly, then you will finish our enemies. They have no power, although their number is hundred times. Just like Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas, they have no power, //yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [[books:bg:18:78|[Bg. 18.78]]]. Keep Kṛṣṇa in your side, then everything will be successful. //Tatra śrīr vijayo bhūtiḥ.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, we have to go now, catch our airplane. You'll be coming to America in about a month's time?

**Hari-śauri:**
Three weeks.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think so.

**Hari-śauri:**
Three weeks.

**Prabhupāda:**
Three weeks.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The Ratha-yātrā in New York is taking place on July 18th. So I think it's...

**Prabhupāda:**
So if I go earlier in New York, my place is available?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yeah. If you like to come it's ready. It'll be ready for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm, I want to go. I want to see how this new building is...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Utilized.

**Prabhupāda:**
Because I went there in New York, no place to stay. It is very engladdening we have got now nice building.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This place is the best facility we have in the movement. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Baladeva means Nityānanda. //Nitāiyer karuṇā habe braje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe.// In this way I was praying. //Balarām hoile nitāi.// So this word //bolo// I [indistinct]. It is supported by Vedic version: //nāyam ātmā bala-hinena labhyaḥ.// Without Baladeva... Give this garland to him and this flower to that boy. [indistinct] [end]
