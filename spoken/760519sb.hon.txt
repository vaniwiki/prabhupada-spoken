[leads devotees in chanting]

[02:09]

So //sakṛn manaḥ. Sakṛt// means even if once in ecstasy, mind, //kṛṣṇa padāravindayoḥ,// the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, if one thinks, //niveṣitam,// with full ecstasy and absorption, if one thinks very nicely about the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, //tad-anurāgi,// being attached, //anurāgi, yaiḥ,// anyone, //iha,// in this material world... Then what happens? //Na te yamaṁ pāśa-bhṛtaś ca tad-bhaṭān. Yama-pāśa...// Yamarāja, the superintendent of death... After death one goes to Yamarāja. Not the devotees, but the nondevotees. //Na te yamaṁ pāśa-bhṛtaś ca tad-bhaṭān svapne:// "Even in dream they do not see Yamaraja." //Svapne 'pi paśyanti cīrṇa-niṣkṛtāḥ.// And completely freed from all reaction of sinful activities, simply by once thinking of Kṛṣṇa. We are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// but if we become at least once in life in ecstasy in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, then all our sinful reaction of life is finished. Unfortunately, we again commit sinful life. Otherwise, by chanting once Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// one becomes immediately free from the reaction.

But the //māyā// is so powerful that it induces again to commit sinful life. So we have to promise... Just like Jagāi Mādhāi. They were delivered by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They were very sinful, their activities. Sinful means that has become ordinary things nowadays in Kali-yuga. They... What is that sinful? They were drunkards, illicit sex, meat-eater and gambling. These four things, they were very much addicted, so they were rejected from the society. The society was so pure. Five thousand years before, Parīkṣit Mahārāja gave the Kali-yuga four places. First of all he wanted to kill Kali. Then he begged pardon, "Sir, I am also your //praja,// a citizen in your kingdom. So it is my business to kill these animals. So why you are punishing me? So give me protection. What can I do?" So Parīkṣit Mahārāja allowed, "No, you cannot do in my kingdom. You have to go out." So Parīkṣit Mahārāja was the emperor of the whole world, so the Kali, he said, "Sir, you say go out of your kingdom, but where is not your kingdom? Everywhere, throughout the whole world, where shall I go?" Then he designated that "You stay in these four places." "What are those places?" "Now, where illicit sex, brothel, prostitutes are going on. You can live there. And where unnecessary animal killing is going on, you can stay here. And where drinking, intoxication is encouraged, you can stay there. And where gambling is there, you can stay there." So he could not find any place throughout the whole world where these things were going on. That is the kingdom of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. There was no chance. So it is the government's duty to see that people are very nicely ruled so that they become all-pious. That is the duty of the government. [break] No, they were //rājarṣi. Imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. Because if the king, monarch, is properly instructed, and if he orders that "My subject, my citizens, should follow this order," then it will be automatically followed out by king's order.

So in the Kali-yuga, this age, there is no such king. There is no such government. Therefore people are becoming polluted. It is the duty of the //guru,// the duty of the parents, duty of the government to train people in such a way that they may become pious, sinless. But they do not believe, even in the next life, that "If we act impiously, then we have to suffer next life." They avoid to believe that there is next life. But there is next life. In the morning we were talking about this. How you can say there is no next life? The child has got next life: a boy. The boy has got next life: a young man. And the young man has next life: to become old man. Similarly, the old man has got next life. It is very common logic. And it is spoken by Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority. Even if you do not understand, your dull brain, but we have to accept the words of Kṛṣṇa. That is the critical point. If we take Kṛṣṇa's instruction, everything will be solved. There will be no problem.

Therefore we are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// to induce people to take as it is. Don't make any amendment, interpretation. As Kṛṣṇa says, you do it; then your life is successful. The instruction is there. It is not that we are manufacturing some ideas. No. That is not our business. We are following the same principle as Kṛṣṇa said to the sun-god:

> imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ
> proktavān aham avyayam
> vivasvān manave prāhur
> manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt
> [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]

> evaṁ paramparā prāptam
> imaṁ rājarṣayo...
> [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]

The same thing. We have no difficulty. If you say, "How can I take instruction from Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is not present." No, Kṛṣṇa is present by His instruction. The //Bhagavad-gītā// is there. Not that it is necessary... Kṛṣṇa is always present, but you have no eyes to see. That is another thing. Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere. //Aṇḍāntara-sthaṁ paramāṇu cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere, even within the atom. But we cannot see. That is another thing. I have no eyes to see. But if I develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then I'll see constantly Kṛṣṇa. This is the effect. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to develop love for Kṛṣṇa. So one who has developed this love for Kṛṣṇa, he can see Kṛṣṇa every moment. There is no difficulty. Kṛṣṇa is present.

So even though you think that Kṛṣṇa is not present, but He is present by His words, //Bhagavad-gītā.// He is absolute. Kṛṣṇa the person, and Kṛṣṇa's words, //Bhagavad-gītā,// there is no difference. //Advaya-jñāna,// no duality. Everything is one, absolute. Kṛṣṇa is absolute, Kṛṣṇa's instruction is also absolute, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes absolute. Everything. That is Absolute Truth. There is no difference. In the material world the name and the thing is different. Suppose here is mango, so mango is the thing and mango is the name. So if I simply say "Mango, mango, mango," there is no mango. There must be the thing, mango. That is duality. This is the world of duality. "Absolute" means the name mango and the mango thing is the same. Otherwise what is the... If they're different, then what is the use of chanting "Kṛṣṇa"? Kṛṣṇa chanting means Kṛṣṇa this word, and Kṛṣṇa the person, the same. Therefore by constant chanting means constantly associating with Kṛṣṇa. Then we are becoming purified. Purified. There is no difference.

So we have to understand this philosophy. Everything is there in the book. So we have to read it carefully, understand it through the teacher's, or //guru's,// instruction. So in this way, if our mind becomes fixed up in Kṛṣṇa the person or the Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa word, //sakṛt,// once only... //Sakṛt// means once only, yes. //Kṛṣṇa padāravindayoḥ, pandāyo, niveśitam,// fully absorbed. This practice, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, means to practice this, how to fix up the mind always at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa also advised the same thing: //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. //Mayy āsakta-manaḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. This is //yoga,// meditation. If you simply sit down in a place and you... It is recommended that in a solitary place and sitting straight, right angle, and not closing the eyes but half open---this is //yoga// practice---and looking over this point of nose, and observing celibacy, //brahmacarya,// following the rules and regulations, in this way you can practice //yoga.// Not that you can do whatever nonsense you like and you have become a //yogī.// This bluff is going on. The //yoga// system---first //yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ,// to control the senses. And now it is going on, Transcendental Meditation, that "After practicing //yoga// you will increase your sex power." This is going on. And that is accepted as //yoga,// and they are paying for it. I have seen. Yes. This is going on. //Yoga-indriya...// Just the opposite. People want sense gratification. If somebody encourages, "Yes, you take this //mantra// and you'll be very powerful sex enjoyer," so people will pay for that: "Yes, give me that." This rascaldom is going on. You see? So what we can do? We can simply explain. But people want to be cheated. That is the thing. //Satya bole tomare lata.// There is a Hindi proverb that "If somebody speaks the truth, it is received in [indistinct], and if he speaks lies, all bluffing, then it is received, and payment is there."

One scientist in Delhi, our Delhi festival, he said very nicely that "We scientists, we are just like learning how to bark like dog." Yes. [laughter] He said very plainly. Because a dog is barking, everyone knows. But if there is a tent and advertisement, yes, that "Mr. Such-and-such will bark like a dog," and people will come and pay ten dollars' fee: "A man is barking? Very wonderful. Let us see." So these rascals, the chemists, they are trying to manufacture living being within test tube, and they are becoming very famous: "Oh, now they are making life in the..." Rascal, there are so many hundreds and millions of life are there, every day being created. What credit you'll get if you manufacture a life within test tube? But the rascals, they are: "Oh, scientists. He is now going to manufacture life." "No, show me how made..." "Yes, we are trying. It will be, in future." Yes. Our Svarūpa Dāmodara... There was one professor, he came to California. He was speaking how from matter life can be there. He has written one volume, book, and he has got Nobel Prize, and the book's name is //Evolution of Chemicals and Life.// So he is also doctor in chemistry, our Svarūpa Dāmodara. He was also present there. As soon as he asked, "Sir, if I give you the chemicals, can you manufacture life?" at that time he said, "That I cannot say." "Why you cannot say? You are speaking that 'Combination of chemical brings in life.' " We are writing one book that life is from life, not from matter. That is not possible. These rascals are simply bluffing that "From chemicals life can be manufactured." No. We challenge.

So these things are going on. We want to be cheated, and there are so many cheaters. //Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ.// The //Bhāgavata// has discussed everything. These rascals are //andhā,// blind, and one blind man is promising to lead other blind men. So what will be the result? If one man is not blind, he can lead hundreds of blind men. That is fact. But if the leader is also blind, then what is the use of leading such blind men? So that is discussed in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam://

> na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ
> durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ
> andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās
> te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ
> [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]

//Īśa-tantra,// by the laws of nature, or laws of God... Laws of nature means laws of God. They accept, "By nature it is..." But they do not know who is behind this nature. That is intelligence. Nature is dead matter. It cannot... Just like this microphone, this is matter, material. What is that? Some iron, some other thing, some wood, some... But this iron-wood combination cannot take place and become a microphone. No. There is a life behind this iron and wood, and he has manufactured; therefore it is working. But these rascals, they are thinking that combination of this iron and wood and something else, it has become microphone. No. It is a machine, but machine is manipulated and manufactured by life, not that automatically the iron-wood becomes a machine. No. So these rascals, they cannot understand that the nature is working---that's all right---but how it is working? What is the background? That they do not know. That answer is in the //Bhagavad-gītā. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]: "Under My superintendence it is working," Kṛṣṇa says. That's a fact. You might have manufactured a very big machine. That is all manufactured by some life. Not that the iron and wood has come together, a skyscraper building---the bricks have come all together automatically. They say, "By chance." What is this nonsense? By chance these bricks have come and piled and become rooms? Just see. These things are going on, rascals. Therefore //andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. [aside:] Let him sleep somewhere.

So this is going on. Don't be misled. //Īśa-tantrya,// by the laws of nature, we are bound up tight, hands and legs. We are not independent. You cannot do anything independently. You are completely under the clutches of material nature. And behind the material nature is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore our business is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa and take knowledge from Him, and then you become perfect. That is explained here, //sakṛn manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor niveśitaṁ tad-guṇa-rāgi yair iha.// Who will take instruction from Kṛṣṇa? //Tad-guṇa-rāgi,// when you understand that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. We have to take instruction from Him." Nobody is perfect except Kṛṣṇa. Or one who follows Kṛṣṇa, he is perfect. Kṛṣṇa is perfect; one who follows Kṛṣṇa, he is perfect. Just like a child. He does not know what it is, but if he takes instruction from his father or teacher that "This is microphone," so when he says, "This is microphone," this is perfect. He may be child, but because he has learned from his father or teacher, "This is microphone," and he says, "This is microphone. This is this," then it is perfect. So the instruction of Kṛṣṇa is perfect, and the teacher or //guru// who speaks the same thing as Kṛṣṇa says, that is perfect. And if he manufacture his own ideas and becomes more than Kṛṣṇa, then he's a rascal number one. There is no benefit.

Thank you very much.
