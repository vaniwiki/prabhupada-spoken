====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.30 ======

**Pradyumna:** Translation: "My dear King, the order carriers of Viṣṇu, the Viṣṇūdutas, immediately arrived when they heard the holy name of their master from the mouth of the dying Ajāmila, who had certainly chanted without offense because he had chanted in complete anxiety."

**Prabhupāda:**

> niśamya mriyamāṇasya

So this is the benefit of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Both the order carriers of Yamarāja and order carriers of Lord Viṣṇu, they're everywhere, just like the police is everywhere. But as soon as you call them, from the police station they immediately inform the patrol police on the car, and immediately he comes. If there is such material arrangement within the government, how much nice arrangement is there in the supreme government?

So we have to practice this, that Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// If we practice, there is chance at the time of death repeating the same thing, Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// So immediately you are saved, not to go to the //yama-mandira.// The powerful name, holy name, is as good as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference. Absolute. Absolute means... Just like here, if I simply chant "mango, mango, mango," there is no mango. Mango is different from the name mango. If I want to eat mango, the substance mango I must have. So there is difference between the name and its substance. That is material---duality. But in the absolute world there is..., means there's no duality. The name mango and mango: the same. This requires advanced knowledge. So there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa the name and Kṛṣṇa the person. There is no difference. Otherwise, this is practical. You're chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Twenty-four hours you can chant, you'll never feel tired. But if you chant any other thing... [break]

//...etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavān mamāpi durdaivam īdṛśam ihājani nānurāgaḥ// [[books:cc:antya:20:16|[Cc. Antya 20.16]]]. God realization... The atheist class, they say, "There is no God." But let him chant the God's holy name, he'll see God. There is no difficult process of... In the Kali-yuga especially, this is a special prerogative of this age because God realization is very, very difficult for them. But if you take advantage of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mercy... It is... Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mercy means it is perpetual. Not that because Caitanya Mahāprabhu has introduced the //saṅkīrtana// movement, therefore the name is as good as the person. No. It is always, the name Nārāyaṇa or Kṛṣṇa, the name of the Supreme Lord, is as good as the Su... It is always. But in this age especially it has got special potency. That is the..., because we are all very, very fallen souls. [child crying] [aside:] The child. We are very, very fallen souls. We cannot do anything. It is very, very difficult. Although at any time, as it is said before, //kevalayā bhaktyā. Kecit kevalayā bhaktyā vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]. Simply by //bhakti,// devotional service, one can become liberated from all contamination. That's a fact, especially in this age. Otherwise why the Europeans and Americans, they will join this movement and chant if there is no effective measure? Why? They are not fools, rascals; they are educated. They're coming from respectable family. It is not that we are befooling them to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance. No. They are feeling ecstasy. It's a fact. Not blindly they are doing. Not only in one place---hundreds of centers. Why? That is the effect of chanting. If you chant, you get the effect, because the holy name and the Supreme Lord, there is no difference.

That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu says: //nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija...// [[books:cc:antya:20:16|[[books:cc:antya:20:16|[[books:cc:antya:20:16|[Cc. Antya 20.16, Śikṣāṣṭaka 2]]]]]. God has many names. It is not that you have to chant only "Kṛṣṇa." No. If you have got any other name of God... Must be God's name. But they do not believe in God. Generally they think there is no God, or if there is God, God is dead. Something like that. And I don't think there is any definitive name in any other religious system. It is only in the Vedic system there is name. So anyway, if somebody thinks that "This 'Kṛṣṇa' is Indian name. Why shall I chant 'Kṛṣṇa'?" Well, you chant any other name, but it must be God's name. Then it will be effective. Just like immediately chanted "Nārāyaṇa." Not that one has to chant "Kṛṣṇa." "Nārāyaṇa" will do. "Govinda" will do. Must be God's name, because God and God's names... There are //sahasra,// one thousand, //Viṣṇu-stotra.// God has many names, hundreds and thousands. So any name you prefer, you chant, you'll get the result. This is the process. God, factually, He has no name. How many names you will remember? But His names are given according to His activities. Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is the best name. Why? That Kṛṣṇa means "all-attractive." This name can attract everyone. This is the most perfect. Although God has many names, out of many names the Kṛṣṇa name is //mukha,// or the primary.

So Caitanya Mahāprabhu has introduced Kṛṣṇa name, //kṛṣṇa-varṇam.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu's identification is given in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, kṛṣṇa-varṇam, kṛṣṇam varṇa iti, iti kṛṣṇa-varṇam.// He is always chanting "Kṛṣṇa." He's Kṛṣṇa, //kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ// [SB 11.5.32]. The incarnation of Caitanya Mahāprabhu is described in the Eleventh Canto, perhaps Fifth Chapter. He's described. He has recommended in the //śāstra// that in the Kali-yuga this incarnation, this form of God, should be worshiped. What is that? That is here: //kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ.// He is always chanting "Kṛṣṇa," and He's Kṛṣṇa. He belongs to the category of Kṛṣṇa, //kṛṣṇa-varṇam. Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ.// But in this age His bodily complexion is not blackish, [indistinct]. //Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ saṇgopaṅgāstra-pārṣadam// [SB 11.5.32]: accompanied by His associates, just like there is Nityānanda, there is Advaita, there is Gadādhara.

So //saṅga upaṅgāstra-pārṣadam. Astra, astra// means weapon. So //saṅga...// Because when God incarnates, He has got two business: //paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. So one business is to give protection to the devotee and to annihilate the //duṣkṛta,// those who are sinful. So for annihilating, it requires weapon, //śaṇkha, cakra, gadā, padma//[?]. Lord Rāmacandra has got bows and arrows, and Kṛṣṇa has got Sudarśana-cakra. But here it is said, //saṅga-upaṅga-astra.// What is that //astra,// weapon? Caitanya Mahāprabhu has no //astra.// Seemingly there's a... But this is //astra,// this //hari-saṅkīrtana.// This is //astra.// In the Kali-yuga there is no profit by killing them. They're already killed. So therefore this is the //astra.// To kill the miscreants this is //astra,// this //hari-saṅkīrtana.// If they simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, this is //astra// that will kill all their sinful reaction of life; they'll become devotee. This is //astra.// Now it is not required the bows and arrows or... Because they're already dead, because they have no conception of God. Simply fighting how to avoid God, this is their business. It is very difficult to convince them about the existence of... They're seeing every moment there is existence of God, but they're so stubborn, so much bewildered by //māyā,// they'll not. So under the circumstances Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He's therefore called //namo mahā-vadānyāya,// most munificent incarnation. Why? //Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te// [[books:cc:madhya:19:53|[Cc. Madhya 19.53]]]. Even without understanding Kṛṣṇa, simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// they become ecstatic for love of Kṛṣṇa. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's benediction: no qualification, but if he simply chants Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// he'll be ecstatic. //Kṛṣṇa-prema-pradāya te.//

To understand Kṛṣṇa is very difficult job. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. Out of many millions of persons, one is endeavoring to make his life perfect. But they do not know what is perfection of life. So //yatatām api siddhānām. Siddhi// means to understand that "I'm not this body. I don't belong to this material world." That is //siddhi. Siddhi.// Everyone is under the impression that "I'm this body." "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am Christian"---bodily //upādhi,// designation. He does not become free from the designation. The other day we were talking on Mr. Huxley, I think. He was talking of philosophy, but he was thinking, "I'm Englishman. I do this like that." So this bodily concept of life is there, although he's philosopher. What kind of philosopher? Philosophy begins when there is no more bodily conception. What is that? //Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat paratvena nirmalam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. So this kind of philosophy has no meaning, because how a dog can become philosopher? That is not possible. A human being can become philosopher. But the..., so long I'm on the bodily concept of life, I'm in the line of cats and dogs. So how we can become philosopher? There is no question of philosopher. But they're philosophizing, means bluffing, and similar men, he's thinking, "I believe." You believe or not believe, the law will go on.

So everyone is proposing "I believe." That's why the government law is there, that "If you do this, you'll be punished like this." That is government law. Suppose you have stolen something, committed theft. You must be punished by six months' imprisonment. So you believe or not believe, the law will act. If you say in the court, "I believe," what is the meaning of your belief? There is no question of belief. Law is law. Ignorance is no excuse. If you go in the court and if you are punished, so if you say, "My Lordship, I believe like this. I'll not be punished. So you're punishing me," so that is no excuse. You believe or not believe, the law is law. So, similarly, these philosophers theorizing so many "I believe." So these things will not do. These things will not do. That is useless, simply waste of time. You must know there is God. How we can deny it? There is supreme power. I am being controlled every moment. Who wants to die? And who is forcing me to die? How he can deny the superior power? I do not want to become old man, and superior power forces me, "You must become old man." So, so long there is force behind you, you have to act according to that. Where is your so-called belief or independence? That is foolishness. That is foolishness. But they have no brain that "I am being kicked. I'm being enforced to do something, and still I'm thinking 'independent,' 'I believe.' " What is this meaning of your belief? There is no question of. This is foolishness.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is just to educate man that you believe or not believe, it doesn't matter. There is God. There is the proprietor. But He is coming personally and He's saying, //bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaraṁ suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]: "I am the proprietor, I am the enjoyer, and I am everyone's friend. If you want to be delivered from this miserable condition of material life, I am your best friend." //Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām.// Kṛṣṇa. Because He's the father. Although He's the... Who can be better friend than the father? Hah? Father always wants to see that "My son is happy." That is natural. There is no begging, "Father, be kind upon me." No. Father is already kind. But if you revolt against the father, then you suffer. Similarly, God is our father, God is our friend, naturally, and He says that //suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām, ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]: "I am the seed-giving...," not only for the human being---all species of life, they are living entities; then according to your //karma,// therefore different dresses. Just like we have got in this meeting different dresses. So every one of us human beings; the dress may be different. That is another thing. Similarly, the living entity is part and parcel of God, but someone has become human beings, some has become cats, someone has become tree, some as insects, some as demigods, some as Brahmā, some as the ant---varieties. Because they wanted to become like that, and God has given him the chance, "All right. You want to become like this and enjoy life? All right, you become like this." So this is arrangement, that God is there, and He is everyone's father. He is everyone's friend. He is always ready. He's coming personally to canvas. He's so kind. Just hear, immediately.

God has sent so many order carriers. "Just see if one is inclined to come to Me." Just see. So as soon as the order carriers---they're travelling everywhere---so "Here's a person, he's chanting 'Nārāyaṇa.' Come on. Take him." Just see. "Here is a person, he's chanting 'Nārāyaṇa.' Yes." //Bhartur nāma mahārāja niśaṁya.// "Oh, it is wonderful. He's chanting 'Nārāyaṇa.' " Immediately Yamadūtas wonder, "Why they are disturbing him? Stop!"

So take this chance of chanting //harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]. You are always safe. The Yamadūtas, the order carriers of Yamadūta, will not be able to touch you. It is so efficient. So take this opportunity, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. I'm very glad that you are doing, but be very strict; sincerely chant---your life is saved, your next life is saved, everything is all right.

Thank you very much.
