====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 6.1.45 ======

**Pradyumna:** Translation: "In proportion to the extent of one's religious or irreligious actions in this life, one must enjoy or suffer the corresponding reactions of his //karma// in the next."

**Prabhupāda:**

> yena yāvān yathādharmo
> dharmo veha samīhitaḥ
> sa eva tat-phalaṁ bhuṅkte
> tathā tāvad amutra vai
> [[books:sb:6:1:45|[SB 6.1.45]]]

So, one has to suffer or enjoy. There are two things. So that is according to our activities. That we can practically experience. If one is educated, naturally he gets a good position, and if one is criminal, he gets another position. There is no difficulty to understand. So there are two things, //dharma// and //adharma,// religiosity and irreligiosity. Religiosity means to abide by the orders of God, and irreligiosity means to disobey the orders of God. That's all. Simple thing. But in this connection we must know what is the order of God, what is God, how He orders, how to execute, how we become fit for executing orders. These things..., these questions are there, but God is speaking personally, "This is My order," in the //Bhagavad-gītā// you'll find, very simple thing.

What Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā?// First of all, He establishes Himself that "I am the Supreme Lord." //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. So the Māyāvādīs, they also think that "I am also Kṛṣṇa. I can also speak." No. That you cannot do. Just like we are singing this song daily, //gopī-jana-vallabha giri-vara-dhārī.// It is... Kṛṣṇa is playing with the //gopīs.// The //sahajiyās,// they take it very easily. But //giri-vara-dhārī,// oh, that is very difficult thing. He raised the whole Govardhana Hill in His finger. That nobody is imitating. But //gopī-jana-vallabha,// very easy. "You are //gopī,// I am Kṛṣṇa. Let us enjoy." This is //sahajiyā.// This is //sahajiyā.// That is going on, //parakīyā-rasa.// All rascaldom is going on. But one should understand that "Here is Kṛṣṇa. He can dance with the //gopīs// and He can lift the Govardhana Hill also, simultaneously." That is also for pleasing the //gopīs.// When there was incessant rainfall, all the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana became so disturbed, and they had no other friend than Kṛṣṇa. So they appealed, "Kṛṣṇa, do something!" "Yes!" Immediately He raised the whole hill as umbrella: "Come on under this." So that is Kṛṣṇa. So don't imitate Kṛṣṇa, but hear Kṛṣṇa, what says; then our life is successful. We cannot imitate God. We have to simply follow His order. That is //dharma.// And if you imitate Kṛṣṇa, that is //adharma.// Don't try to imitate. There are two words in Sanskrit, //anukāraṇa, anusaraṇa. Anukāraṇa// means imitation, and //anusaraṇa// means follow. So we have to execute //anusaraṇa,// follow. //Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya. Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya// [SB 10.33.29].

The Parīkṣit Mahārāja inquired that Śukadeva Gosvāmī, "Kṛṣṇa, He came to establish //dharma,// but it appears that He danced with other's wife or other's daughter." According to Vedic civilization you cannot mix with any other woman except your wife. That is not allowed. So in according to the Vedic conception of life, it was not right thing that Kṛṣṇa danced with other's wife or other's daughter. This question was put. Parīkṣit Mahārāja said that Kṛṣṇa, because He is God, He cannot do anything wrong. Just like in England, the Constitution, "The king can do no wrong." King cannot be subject to any law. Similarly, when Kṛṣṇa danced with the //gopīs,// it has got a deep meaning. Because they are all devotees, they did not know except Kṛṣṇa, and they prayed to the Kātyāyanī, although they were married, they prayed to Kātyāyanī before they were married, that "Let Kṛṣṇa become our husband." Kṛṣṇa is so beautiful, naturally there is attraction. //Kṛṣṇa// means "all-attractive." So... And they were not ordinary women. They are eternal consorts or associates of Kṛṣṇa. //Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ// [Bs. 5.37]. They are expansion of Kṛṣṇa; they are not ordinary women. Expansion of Kṛṣṇa. //Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtiḥ hlādinī-śaktiḥ asmād// [[books:cc:adi:1:5|[Cc. Ādi 1.5]]] The //gopīs,// Rādhārāṇī, they are expansion of the spiritual energy of Kṛṣṇa. Don't think they are ordinary women. They are Kṛṣṇa. //Śaktiḥ śaktimator abhedaḥ.// They are not different from Kṛṣṇa. But to give Kṛṣṇa pleasure, Kṛṣṇa expands Himself by His spiritual energy, //ānanda hlādinī,// spiritual energy, //sandinī hlādinī.// That is the expansion of His pleasure potency. It is not that to imitate //gopīs.// That is //sahajiyā.// That is //sahajiyā.// They are //ānanda-cin-māyā-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūto// [Bs. 5.37]. When Kṛṣṇa wants pleasure, He is full spiritual, His pleasure is full spiritual. There is no question of material. It has been very broadly described by Śrī Jīva Gosvāmī. Read all this. Don't try to imitate. That is //sahajiyā.// We should know the position of Kṛṣṇa, His expansion of pleasure potency.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa's //līlā// is put into the middle of the Tenth Canto. First of all, try to understand Kṛṣṇa from the very beginning. //Janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. What is Kṛṣṇa? //Vāsudeve. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// So what is Vāsudeva? //Janmādy asya yato.// Here is the original source of everything. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]. First of all, try to understand Kṛṣṇa. So therefore Vyāsadeva has dedicated full nine cantos for understanding Kṛṣṇa. //Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. //Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. [break] //...siddhis,// they think of //gopīs.// That is recommended in //Caitanya-caritāmṛta, siddha-deha.// So where is //siddha?// And //siddha-deha// means there is no more any material lusty desires. That is //siddha-deha.//

> yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-pādāravinde
> nava-nava-rasa-dhāmany udyataṁ rantum āsīt
> tad-avadhi bata nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne...

So long we shall think of //nārī-saṅga,// association, unity with woman, we must consider this is material body, not //siddha// body. //Siddha// body means //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]: all material desires, zero. That is //siddha// body. So therefore it is very confidential. But to clear it, that "How Kṛṣṇa accepted to dance with so many //gopīs,//" this was for clearance.

In that question, you'll find, Śukadeva Gosvāmī has answered that unless one is liberated, he should not think of it even. Should not think of it. And he has given the example that, you have read, that Lord Śiva, when there was churning, the poison came out, he took it and kept it. But if we imitate Lord Śiva, that "He kept, he also drunk, so let me drink also, let me smoke //gañja,//" no. You cannot do. //Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya// [SB 10.33.29]. The example is given: those who are very, very powerful, they are not contaminated. Just like the sun. Sun is so powerful that it can soak water from the urine or from the stool, but it still is sun. But if you imitate sun and you... Nowadays it is going on. The urine is turned into water and they drink. And from stool they are getting fat. So these things are going on. But we should not try to imitate. The sum and substance is Kṛṣṇa cannot be contaminated. //Apāpa-viddham.// In the //Īśopaniṣad,// you'll find. //Tejīyasām.// Just like sun is never contaminated. From the whole universe, the sun is soaking water from any filthy place, but the filthy place is becoming purified by the sun rays. That is possible by the sun.

So similarly, we cannot imitate Kṛṣṇa. That is //pāpa, adharma. Dharma// is to abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa. That is very simple. And if we do that then we become qualified to go back to home, back to Godhead. Very simple thing. It doesn't require much education. Simply it requires a purified mind, that "I shall execute it honestly." That much qualification is sufficient. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. This is Kṛṣṇa's law and order. Kṛṣṇa does not say anything which is very difficult to execute, because we cannot do it. Kṛṣṇa asks from you very simple thing. Not that Kṛṣṇa is asking from you very things which we cannot supply. No. We can supply. Anyone, any poor man, any illiterate man, any poor man or any rich man. Everyone. It is open to everyone. //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ.// Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not forbidden to anyone, even //pāpa-yoni.//

> mām hi pārtha vyapāśritya
> ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ
> striyo vaiśyas tathā śūdras
> te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim
> [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]

//Kiṁ punar brāhmaṇāḥ puṇya bhaktā rājarṣayas tathā// [[books:bg:9:33|[Bg. 9.33]]]. //Bhajasva mām.// This is Kṛṣṇa's instruction. Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī:// "Simply always think of Me." This is the law and order. Who cannot think of Kṛṣṇa? Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Very easy. Where is the difficulty? This is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. //Man-manā, bhava mad-bhakto.// And unless one is devotee, he cannot spend time in that way, "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa." Only the devotees can do. And //mad-yājī,// to worship Kṛṣṇa. So if somebody says, "I am very poor man. I cannot construct such a nice temple or offer Kṛṣṇa so many nice foodstuffs," Kṛṣṇa says, "No. No need." //Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati// [[books:bg:9:26|[Bg. 9.26]]]. "Come on." You do not require. If you have money, then spend it for Kṛṣṇa, as much as you can. Then if you don't spend, if you think, "Kṛṣṇa wants //patraṁ puṣpam;// the money I shall keep in the bank for my pleasure," then Kṛṣṇa will cheat you also. If you want to cheat Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is the greatest cheater. Then you'll be cheated. Don't be cheater. Simply, fervently, very honestly obey the orders of Kṛṣṇa. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām.// Four things. And what is the result? //Mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]: "Without any doubt, you'll come back to Me." What do you want more? [laughter] That Kṛṣṇa is so nice.

So spread this movement all over your country. Your country is... By the grace of Kṛṣṇa, everything is there. And the first qualification is that you are not poverty-stricken. So take the instruction of Kṛṣṇa and be happy. Open similar temples all over your country. Your country is not poor. You can establish such temples, hundreds and thousands. And similarly assemble, hear Kṛṣṇa's instruction, and see how happy you'll become.

Thank you very much.
