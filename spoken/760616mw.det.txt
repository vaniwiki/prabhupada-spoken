====== Morning Walk ======

[No Audio]

**Prabhupāda:**
...wrong yesterday?

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
No, you were right on the mark, Prabhupāda. Always. The old man, the other night, when you said that, he said, "This is something like elitism."

**Prabhupāda:**
Elitism? What is that.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They think it's only for a certain section of people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Gentlemen class. Without first-class man, what is the use of second-class, third-class men. They will ever remain in the darkness.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Christians have a tendency to disbelieve that man can lead man back to God. They think that Christ or God comes, and then, like this. It doesn't matter what quality of men they are.

**Prabhupāda:**
God comes, when God says, "Come to the kingdom of God," that is God comes [indistinct].

**Hariśauri:**
No, he's saying that God can take you there, but then after God's...

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
The Christians themselves, throughout the centuries, they have no faith that someone can be so much exalted that they can lead human society. In other words, the Christians have no faith that actually someone can become God conscious.

**Devotee:**
They say Christ is God.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They say everyone is sinful; therefore what is the use?

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone sinful, therefore... Christ is not sinful, therefore somebody may be sinful.

**Hariśauri:**
But their whole philosophy is that no one can be sinless except Christ.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right, then why don't you follow Christ? Christ says "Thou shall not kill," then why do you interpret? "Christ ate meat, therefore we shall open slaughterhouse," this is rascaldom. This rascaldom [indistinct]. Because maybe somewhere he has eaten fish, therefore, by following in his footsteps, we shall open slaughterhouse and kill thousands of animals daily. The evidence is Christ has eaten fish. Do they not say that? And they are Christians. All others are sinful [indistinct], that's all right, why don't you kill [indistinct]. Several times these Christians [indistinct].

**Devotee:**
Everyone in the world is becoming tenth-class men, but Śrīla Prabhupāda is turning the whole thing around. Had you not come, there would be no hope for the whole world.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
They say that "Thou shalt not kill," that's okay, but this is an impossible instruction.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is rascaldom.

**Hariśauri:**
That's a common philosophy. The Ten Commandments are there, but they're an ideal that no one can ever achieve.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then you go to hell, rascaldom. [last two minutes of tape indistinct] [end]
