====== Initiation Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[//prema-dhvani//] [devotees offer obeisances]

**Pradyumna:**
//Acama// has finished. Ten offenses.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have said? So I have to speak something?

**Pradyumna:**
If you like. There are some Indians, if you want to speak.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Pradyumna:**
You could if you wish.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa?

**Pradyumna:**
He's very behind on typing or something, so he wanted to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So this is... So many devotees are being initiated. So initiation means, the Sanskrit word is //dīkṣā. Dīkṣā. Divya jñānaṁ kṣapayati iti dīkṣā. Divya-jñāna.// There are two kinds of knowledge: //divya// and mundane. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. This is the instruction of Mahārāja... What is? Bhārata Mahārāja's father?

**Pradyumna:**
Ṛṣabhadeva.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ṛṣabhadeva. Ṛṣabhadeva is the father of Mahārāja Bhārata, under whose name this planet is called Bhāratavarṣa, from Mahārāja Bhārata. Formerly, the king of Bhāratavarṣa... The whole planet was called Bhāratavarṣa. So this... Before that, it was known as Ilāvṛtavarṣa. So Mahārāja Bhārata, the eldest son of Ṛṣabhadeva. Ṛṣabhadeva was incarnation of God. So He advised His one hundred sons, "My dear boys, //tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattya// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]." Before retirement and making Bhārata Mahārāja the emperor of the world, He gave them advice. It is the duty of the father. Generally, we do also. Before retirement, the instruction is given by the father how to rule over the kingdom or manage the business. Anyone, as it is. So retirement was compulsory. Not that unless he's shot dead he's not going to retire. No. This was not Vedic civilization. At the present moment there is no Vedic civilization. Nobody is going to retire unless he's shot dead. But Vedic civilization was not like that. Retirement compulsory. //Brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa//---four divisions of spiritual order. Human life is meant for spiritual realization, and sense gratification is animal life. This meeting is for the human beings, not for the cats and dogs. They cannot come here, neither they will understand what is going on here. A human body, human being, has the chance to understand the philosophy of life as it was enunciated by Ṛṣabhadeva.

He said,

> nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke
> kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye
> tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvaṁ
> yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam
> [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]

He said, "My dear boys, this human form of life," //ayaṁ deha,// this body... //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājām.// Everyone has got body. The Brahmā has got body, and the small insect, it has got also body. The spirit soul is encaged in this material body. So lower than the human being, up to the animals, there are so many forms of life. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati// [Padma Purāṇa]. In this way, varieties of life. But Ṛṣabhadeva said, "Now you have got this human form of life, don't spoil it like the hogs and dogs simply by sense gratification." Sense gratification is available by the hogs and dogs also. That was the instruction of Ṛṣabhadeva. And what is the duty of human life? //Tapo, tapasya. Tapasya,// voluntarily accepting some inconvenience. That is called //tapasya.// Generally, we want //loke vyavāya āmiṣa-madya-sevā nityasta jantu. Jantu,// when one is not on the platform of spiritual understanding, they are called //jantu. Jantu// means anyone who has got life. The cats and dogs, they have also got life.

So //loke,// in this material world, //vyavāya āmiṣa madya sevā. Vyavāya// means sex indulgence, sex life. And //āmiṣa// means meat-, fish-, egg-eating. //Āmiṣa.// Therefore vegetarian diet is called //nirāmiṣa,// not //āmiṣa.// So it is general tendency of the living being to become //āmiṣa,// eat meat. That is the general laws of nature. //Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam// [[books:sb:1:13:47|[SB 1.13.47]]]: one living entity is the life for another living entity. //Ahastāni sahastānām.// There are animals, two-legged animals, and there are four-legged animals. The four-legged animals is the food for the two-legged animals. So, so long we remain as animals, then there is the necessity of eating meat. //Ahastāni sahastānām. Hasta// means hands. So those who are living like animals, only two legs. The other animals, four legs, and here is an animal of two legs, //dvipad-paśu.// For them, the animal is eatable, //āmiṣa-madya sevā.// And drinking wine, or intoxication, and //vyavāya,// sex life. //Loke vyavāyāmiṣa-madya sevayā nityastu jantu.// So long he is //jantu,// these things are required. //Pravṛttir eṣā bhūtānāṁ nivṛttis tu mahā-phalā// [Manu-saṁhitā]. That is general tendency. But when one gives up voluntarily for higher status of life, that is called //nivṛtti-mārga. Pravṛtti-mārga// and //nivṛtti-mārga. Pravṛtti-mārga// means to fulfill these desires, //āmiṣa vyavāya madya sevā.// But when one is trained up to give up these habits, that is called //nirvrtti-mārga.// So we have got so many //pravṛttis,// inclinations. But when you voluntarily give up all these nonsense habits, that is called //nivṛtti-mārga// and //tapasya.//

So human life is meant for //tapasya. Tapo-divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. Don't be carried away by the general, menial, abominable tendencies. Therefore //tapasya// required. //Tapa,// we prescribe for //tapasya// no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication and no gambling. This is //tapasya.// This is //tapasya.// We have to accept if we want superior position of life. //Tapo divyam. Tapasya,// the aim of //tapasya// is to be situated on the transcendental platform of knowledge, //tapo divyam.// So this life, this human form of life, is meant for //tapasya// and transcendental knowledge. This is the purport. Not to waste this life, this human form of life, //ayaṁ deha.// The cats and dogs also have //deha,// body. The... Analyze the body of a dog and analyze your body, what is the difference? No difference. There is blood, there is flesh, there is vein, there is so many things, all common things. Then what is the difference between the cat's body and dog's body and your body? The advancement of knowledge and consciousness. So for that //divyam,// knowledge, one has to be initiated. //Divyam. Dīkṣā// means beginning of transcendental knowledge.

So Vedic civilization is //janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ.// By birth, everyone is born a //śūdra,// fourth-class man. But there is chance of the fourth-class man to become the first-class man. That is possible. //Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ.// Everyone, when he's born by the sex behavior of the father and mother, he's a //śūdra.// Then //saṁskārād-bhaved dvija.// By //saṁskāra,// by the purificatory method, this //tapasya,// he becomes a //dvija. Dvi// means "twice" and //ja// means "birth," second birth. //Saṁskārād-bhaved dvija.// Then when he becomes //dvija,// properly initiated, then he's allowed to read Vedic literature, //veda-patha. Śūdra// cannot. If you remain a //śūdra,// no //saṁskāra,// no purification, then you have no right to understand Vedic knowledge. Either you have no right or you cannot understand. Why... The //Bhagavad-gītā// is there. Throughout the whole world, everyone knows //Bhagavad-gītā.// But they have misunderstood, because they are kept //śūdra. Veda-patha.// First of all, by birth, he's a //śūdra,// and when he's purified, then he becomes //dvija. Dvija,// the sacred thread is..., means that this man... //Upanayana.// This is called //upanayana. Upa, upa// means "near," and //nayana// means "bringing." So when one is brought nearer to the spiritual master and he accepts him as his disciple, he gives the sacred thread as badge, that "This man is now //dvija,// twice-born. He's no more //śūdra.// He's //brāhmaṇa.// So he has the right to read the Vedic literature."

So the //Bhagavad-gītā// is the summary of all Vedic knowledge. So if we pass through this process of //divya-jñāna, dīkṣā,// then we rightly understand what is //Bhagavad-gītā// or we become interested that what is the lesson of //Bhagavad-gītā. Veda pathād bhaved vipra.// After reading... //Bhagavad-gītā// is the summary of Vedic literature. You cannot read all the //Vedas// at the present moment, neither you have time, nor you have got the capacity. In this Kali-yuga, //mandāḥ sumanda-matayo// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]], everyone is fallen, //manda-bhāgyā.// So this human life should be utilized for understanding the Vedic knowledge, //divya-jñāna;// then he'll be purified, //tapo divyaṁ yena śuddhyed sattvam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. My existential identity will be purified. At the present moment it is not purified. Because it is not purified, therefore we are repeatedly dying. But there is no knowledge how to stop death. They think death is natural. It is not natural. It is unnatural. They do not know it. But in the //Bhagavad-gītā// you'll get the information, //na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit:// "The soul is never born, never dies." //Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit.// "I see he's died, he is dead." No, he's not dying, his body is being annihi... //Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. By seeing the body is destroyed, don't think he's destroyed. He'll get another body. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. So this is our position. We have accepted one body, and we live in that body for some days, and then again we give up this body, //tathā dehāntara-prāptir.// So this is disease. So in order to get out of this disease there is necessity of //tapasya,// how to stop this disease.

So this initiation means... Don't think that it is something official, ritualistic ceremony, and as soon as we get the initiation, now we have become perfect, and then whatever nonsense I like, I can do. No. //Tapasya// must continue. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. In order to purify yourself, your existence, you have to continue the //tapasya//---no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxication, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. If you follow these five principles, then your existence will be purified, you'll understand Kṛṣṇa from the //Bhagavad-gītā,// you'll know Kṛṣṇa, you'll know what is the purpose of life. The purpose of life is to understand Kṛṣṇa. There is no other business in this human form of life. But because we have given up Kṛṣṇa, we have invented so many occupational duties. So these so-called occupational duties, running here and there on motorcar, is not the end of life. There is something more for the human being, and that is //divya-jñāna. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvam, yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. Why shall I purify my existence? Because you want happiness. That is your desire. So you'll get //brahma-saukhyam,// the greatest happiness, which will never end. If you purify your existence by //tapasya,// then you will be happy eternally. There will be no end. Here in this material world any happiness is temporary---either for five minutes or five days or five years or five hundred years or five millions of years. It will end. But if you purify your existence, then the happiness will never end. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvaṁ yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam. Anantam// means unlimited. It is very serious thing, and it is offered to the human being. So anyone can take advantage of this opportunity and make his life successful.

Thank you very much.
