====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.6.5 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [Prabhupāda and devotees respond] [leads chanting, etc.]

> tato yateta kuśalaḥ
> kṣemāya bhavam āśritaḥ
> śarīraṁ pauruṣaṁ yāvan
> na vipadyeta puṣkalam
> [[books:sb:7:6:5|[SB 7.6.5]]]

[02:01]

Translation: "Therefore, while in material existence [//bhavam āśritaḥ//], a person fully competent to distinguish wrong from right must endeavor to achieve the highest goal of life as long as the body is stout and strong and is not embarrassed by dwindling."

**Prabhupāda:**

> tato yateta kuśalaḥ
> kṣemāya bhavam āśritaḥ
> śarīraṁ pauruṣaṁ yāvan
> na vipadyeta puṣkalam
> [[books:sb:7:6:5|[SB 7.6.5]]]

So this should be the human activity, that //śarīraṁ pauruṣaṁ yāvan na vipadyeta puṣkalam.// So long we are stout and strong and we can work very nicely, the health is quite all right, take advantage of it. It is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for the lazy fellow. No. It is meant for the strong man: strong in body, strong in mind, strong in determination---everything strong---strong in brain. It is meant for them. Because we have to execute the highest goal of life. Unfortunately, they do not know what is the highest goal of life. The modern... Not modern; always. Now it is very conspicuous: people do not know what is the aim of life. Anyone who is in this material world, he is in //māyā,// means he does not know what is the goal of life. //Na te viduḥ,// they do not know, //svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇu. Svārtha-gati.// Everyone is supposed to be self-interested. Self-interest is the first law of nature, they say. But they do not know what is self-interest. He, instead of going back to home, back to Godhead---that is his real self-interest---he's going to become a dog in the next life. Is that self-interest? But they do not know it. How nature's law is working, they do not know it.

//Na te viduḥ. Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram. Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā.//

> matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā
> mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām
> adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ
> punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām
> [[books:sb:7:5:30|[SB 7.5.30]]]

That, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //matir na kṛṣṇe.// People are very much reluctant to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Why? //Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā.// By others' instruction... Just like we are trying to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world, //parataḥ svato. Svato// means personally, by personal endeavor---just I am reading //Bhagavad-gītā// or //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and other Vedic literature. So, //matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā. Mitho vā. Mitho vā// means "by conference." Nowadays it is a very popular thing to hold conferences. So one cannot become Kṛṣṇa conscious either by his personal endeavor or by advice of some other men or by holding big, big conferences. Why? //Gṛha-vratānām:// because his real aim of life is that "I shall remain in this house." //Gṛha-vratānām. Gṛha// means household life, //gṛha// means this body, //gṛha// means this universe. There are so many //gṛhas,// big and small.

So here it is said, //tato yateta kuśalaḥ kṣemāya bhavam āśritaḥ. Bhavam.// This material world is called //bhavaḥ.// And those who are within this material world, they are called //bhava-rogī,// means diseased, in the //bhava// disease. //Bhava// means "you become." //Bhava.// So here in this material world is..., to become, //bhava.// I have already taken birth in some family, I have already become something, //bhava,// but I'll have to die. Then finish? No, //bhava.// Again //bhava.// Again //bhava. Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]], //bhū-dhātu.// So //bhava, bhū,// so //bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate.// This is the nature, material nature. So those who are //bhavam āśritaḥ...// Those who have taken shelter of this material world for repeatedly taking birth and death and suffering old age and disease, they are called //bhavam āśritaḥ.// So for the //bhavam āśritaḥ,// those who are suffering in this disease, there are other, //bhavauṣadhi, bhavauṣadhi.//

> nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād
> bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt
> ka uttamaśloka-guṇānuvādāt
> virajyeta pumān vinā paśughnāt
> [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]

//Vinā paśughnāt. Paśughnāt// means the slayer, killer of animals, or killer of himself. //Paśughnāt.// So //paśu// means "life." So they are killing. So this civilization is a killing civilization. Because the human being has got the opportunity for get out of this //bhavam-āśritaḥ,// this material world where he has to take birth and death, accept birth and death again and again. So this is an opportunity to get out of it. But they are not being properly educated. They are being forced to accept this chronic disease and suffer perpetually. This is the modern civilization.

But Vedic civilization is not like that. Vedic civilization is how to rescue him from this disease, //bhava-roga. Bhava-roga...,// to cure this //bhava-roga,// Caitanya Mahāprabhu has also prescribed, and it is since the creation, Vedic knowledge is that //bhavauṣadhi. Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād// [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]. This chanting of the holy name of the Lord is called //nivṛtta tarṣair upagīyamānād.// This chanting can be performed by //nivṛtta tarṣair,// one who has ceased from all kinds of //tṛṣṇa,// or desire: //sarvopādhi vinirmuktam// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]] or //anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. One who has become free from all kinds of material desires, for them, this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is possible, is very successful. But still, those who are not free from these material desires, it is recommended by Parīkṣit Mahārāja //nivṛtta-tarṣair.// Actually this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// should be done by the liberated person. But still, those who are not liberated, //bhavam-āśritaḥ,// for them it is //bhavauṣadhi:// the disease, medicine of this disease. //Nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād bhavauṣadhi chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt// [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]. It is very pleasing to the ear and the mind. //Chrotra, chrotra// means ear, and //mano// means mind. Even one is not liberated, still, it is so pleasing to the ear and the mind. //Bhavauṣadhac chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt.// Such a nice thing. What is that? //Uttamaśloka-guṇānuvādāt. Uttamaśloka// means the Supreme Personality of Godhead who is prayed by selected poems. //Uttama,// transcendental poetry, transcendental songs. He's worshiped by transcendental vibration of sound. //Ka uttamaśloka-guṇānuvādāt pumān virajyeta vinā paśughnāt.// Who keeps himself aloof from this transcendental vibration of sound? //Vinā paśughnāt:// simply the person who is animal killer. Therefore, meat-eating is so dangerous for a devotee. Because one who is animal killer, he'll never be attracted. Therefore we prescribe that no animal killing. Meat-eater means other things will follow. Illicit sex will follow and drinking will follow. Because you cannot digest meat by water; you must drink. That is the fact. It is so heavy that unless... Therefore, //madhyamanusa,// they are four relatives. If you eat meat, then you have to drink, otherwise, you'll not be able to digest. Then your intestine will be digested, the wine is so strong. Therefore the drunkard must take. In India we have seen---everywhere---this wine and meat, they are together, because you have to digest.

So //nivṛtta-tarṣair upagīyamānād bhavauṣadhac chrotra, vinā-paśughnāt// [[books:sb:10:1:4|[SB 10.1.4]]]. We have to become very simple and pure. Then it is possible to relish the transcendental chanting. So //bhavam āśritaḥ,// for one who has taken shelter. Actually this is not our place. This very word is used, //āśritaḥ.// Unfortunately we have taken shelter of this material world. Otherwise it is not our place. We are spirit soul, //sanātana,// and there is a //sanātana-dhāma,// place. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātanaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. This word is used, //sanātanaḥ.// Means "eternal." These living entities, they're eternal. They are not meant for this world. Here, nothing is eternal; everything is temporary. So why we should remain here? It is not. Therefore it is called //bhavam āśritaḥ.// Unfortunately, he has taken shelter of this place where he has to die and take birth again. So //bhavam āśritaḥ.//

So Prahlāda Mahārāja recommends, //tato yateta kuśalaḥ.// If one is interested for his upliftment, //kuśalaḥ... Kuśalaḥ// means "auspicity." Everyone wants auspicity. //Tato yateta kuśalaḥ kṣemāya bhavam āśritaḥ:// ultimate auspicity or ultimate goal of life. So long the body is strong... Not that... Prahlāda Mahārāja has begun, //kaumāra ācaret prājñaḥ.// General education also, education is given to the children, not to the old men. Because that is the rising of the body. He's receptive; he can take. Prahlāda Mahārāja's recommendation is that so long we are strong, we are in working order, we are not feeble or all energy lost... No. When you have got full energy, full strength, young men, children, they should take this lesson of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is recommended for them, not for the old man who has lost everything. No. But they have taken it that Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is for the old man who is going to die. But here it is recommended: No, for the strong man, youthful children, like that. So Prahlāda Mahārāja is recommending, because the business is very important, //bhavam āśritaḥ:// to get out of this //bhava. Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate// [[books:bg:8:19|[Bg. 8.19]]].

So now, we find from the //Bhagavad-gītā...// There are three words. //Sanātanaḥ,// eternal, is used there. First thing is this //jīva,// these living entities, they have been described as //sanātanaḥ. Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātanaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. We are living entities, //sanātanaḥ.// It is not that we have become //jīva-bhūtaḥ// by the influence of //māyā.// We have put ourself in the influence of //māyā;// therefore we are //jīva-bhūtaḥ.// Actually we are //sanātana. Sanātana// means "eternal." //Nityo śāśvata. Jivātmā// is described: //nityo śāśvato yaṁ na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. That is //sanātana.// So we are so less intelligent that if I am eternal, //sanātana,// I have no birth and death, why I have been put into this tribulation of birth and death? This is called //brahma-jijñāsā.// But we are not educated. But we should be educated. At least we should take advantage of this instruction. We are //sanātana.// And another world is there, mentioned in the //Bhagavad-gītā, paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ// [[books:bg:8:20|[Bg. 8.20]]]. //Vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ.// This material world is manifested, and background of this is the total material energy, //mahāt-tattva.// That is not manifested.

So //vyakto 'vyaktāt.// Beyond this there is another nature, a spiritual nature, //sanātana.// That is called //sanātana. Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ// [[books:bg:8:20|[Bg. 8.20]]]. And the //jīva-bhūtaḥ---sanātana.// And in the Eleventh Chapter, Arjuna describes Kṛṣṇa as //sanātana.// So three //sanātana.// The three //sanātana...// So if we are all //sanātana,// there is //sanātana-dhāma// and Kṛṣṇa is //sanātana,// we are also //sanātana.// So when they are combined together, that is called //sanātana-dharma.// They do not know what is //sanātana-dharma.// They think that if I dress in a certain way and if I am born in a certain community, then I'll become //sanātana-dharma.// No. Everyone can become //sanātana-dharma.// But they do not know what is the meaning of //sanātana.// Every living entity is //sanātana.// And Kṛṣṇa, God, is //sanātana.// And there is a place where we can meet together---that is //sanātana dhāma. Sanātana dhāma, sanātana-bhakti, sanātana-dharma.// When it is executed, that is called //sanātana-dharma.// So what is that //sanātana-dharma?// Suppose I return to that //sanātana-dhāma// and there is God, //sanātana,// and I am //sanātana.// So what is our //sanātana// activities? Does it mean that when I go to //sanātana-dhāma// I become God? No. You do not become God. Because God is one. He's the Supreme Lord, Master, and we are servant. Caitanya Mahāprabhu: //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108]]]. So here, every one of us, we are claiming to become Kṛṣṇa. But when you return to the //sanātana-dhāma,// then we---unless we are qualified we cannot go there---then we eternally engage in the service of the Lord. That is //sanātana-dharma.//

So you practice it. The //sanātana-dharma// means this //bhakti-yoga.// Because we have forgotten. Everyone is trying to become God. Now practice here how to become a servant of God. And if you are qualified, factually, that now you are, rest assured, that you have become a servant of God, that is //bhakti-mārga...// As Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, //gopī-bhartur pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:13:80|[Cc. Madhya 13.80]]]. When you are expert in becoming the servant of the servant of the servant of the servant of the Lord---hundred times down, servant---then you are perfect. But here everyone is trying to become the Supreme Lord. Somebody is misusing the word "//so 'ham,//" "//ahaṁ brahmāsmi,//" and therefore "I am the Supreme." But that is not. These are Vedic words, but //so 'ham// does not mean "I am God." //So 'ham// means "I am also the same quality." Because //mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]], //jīva// is the part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa, so the quality is the same. Just like you take a drop of water from the sea. So the chemical composition of the whole water of the sea and a drop of water---the same. That is called //so 'ham// or //brahmāsmi.// Not that we misuse these words, Vedic version, and I think falsely that "I am God. I have become God." And if you are God, then why you become a dog? Does God becomes dog? No. That is not possible. Because we are minute particle. That is also mentioned in the //śāstra://

> keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya
> śatadhā kalpitasya ca
> jīvaḥ bhāgo sa vijñeya
> sa anantyaya kalpate
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:140|[Cc. Madhya 19.140]]]

Our spiritual identity is that we are ten-thousandth part of the top of the hair. It is like a very small, we divide it into ten thousand part, and one, that is our identity. Now that small identity is within this body. So where you'll find it? You have no such machine. Therefore we say //nirākāra.// No, there is //ākāra,// but it is so minute and small that it is not possible to see with this material eyes. So we have to see through the version of //Vedas. Śāstra cakṣuṣa.// That is the //Vedānta// version. We have to see through the //śāstra.// Not by these blunt eyes. That is not possible.

So all these things should be discussed, should be understood, so long we are young, strong, brain is in order. Then our life will be successful. And Prahlāda Mahārāja is advising:

> tato yateta kuśalaḥ
> kṣemāya bhavam āśritaḥ
> śarīraṁ pauruṣaṁ yāvan
> na vipadyeta puṣkalam
> [[books:sb:7:6:5|[SB 7.6.5]]]

So long you are strong, try your best to understand the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, and be Kṛṣṇa conscious and make your life successful.

Thank you very much.
