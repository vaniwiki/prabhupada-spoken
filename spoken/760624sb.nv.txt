====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 7.6.8 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [Devotees repeat] [leads chanting, synonyms, etc., devotees respond]

> durāpūreṇa kāmena
> mohena ca balīyasā
> śeṣaṁ gṛheṣu saktasya
> pramattasyāpayāti hi

[04:37]

Translation: "One whose mind and senses are uncontrolled becomes increasingly attached to family life because of insatiable lusty desires and very strong illusion. In such a madman's life, the remaining years are also wasted because even during those years he cannot engage himself in devotional service."

**Prabhupāda:**

The calculation of life is already given account. Maximum years, hundred years. Fifty years by sleeping, minus. Then fifty years remains. Then twenty years childhood and playing. Then, remaining thirty years, and twenty years in old age, invalidity, not fulfillment of desires, what to do. In this way twenty years, and balance ten years, because all along one is directed by lusty desires, what he'll do. Prahlāda Mahārāja is trying to establish his submission. It is not theory, but submission, that //kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. From the very childhood this //bhāgavata-dharma// should be taught and learned. Just like here, these boys, they are very fortunate, because from the very beginning of their life they are being taught in //bhāgavata-dharma.// They are coming, take a little flower, offering to the Deity or the spiritual master, offering obeisances, chanting, taking little //prasādam//---these are all taken into account. Every inch of it. It is not that playfully they are doing this. No. Because //bhakti-mārga...// Kṛṣṇa says, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Four things: "Always think of Me, become My devotee, worship Me and offer obeisances unto Me." Four things. So even the child can do it. The child can, because he is mixing with devotees, he's seeing the Deity, naturally his mind always thinks of Kṛṣṇa, naturally, psychology. So //man-manā,// and they're coming to the temple, //mad-bhakta,// becoming //bhakta.// Offering obeisances to the Deity, to the spiritual master, to the Vaiṣṇavas, //bhakta,// they're becoming //bhaktas.// And little flower, fruits, offering to the Deity, //mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru.// It is so easy. And by practicing this, Kṛṣṇa says if you do this only, then //mām evaiṣyasi,// you come back. By doing these four things one can go back to home? Yes. Kṛṣṇa says //asaṁśaya,// "without any doubt." It is so nice. Not that it is gambling: "It may be or..." No. It must be. Anyone who is performing these four principles of devotional service...

I do not know why people are reluctant to do this simple act, when the result is so great. To go home, back to home, back to Godhead is not easy thing. To get out of the clutches of //māyā// and go back to home, back to Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, it is not so easy thing for ordinarily... But Kṛṣṇa personally is coming and teaching so that people may take advantage of it and go back to home, back to Godhead. Still, people could not understand. Therefore Kṛṣṇa came as devotee, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu, teaching the same thing. Teaching the same thing. He, although He's Kṛṣṇa, He never invented anything. That is called //paramparā// system. Although He's God Himself, God also does not invent anything. Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, brahma-sūtra-padaiś caiva hetumadbhir viniścitaiḥ// [[books:bg:13:5|[Bg. 13.5]]]. He's giving reference to the //Brahma-sūtra, Vedānta-sūtra.// So our line is like that. Even God Himself, He can say something new? No. He said to Arjuna, //purātanam yogaṁ proktavān,// that "I am speaking to you the same old philosophy, //purātanam yogam,// which I spoke to the sun-god." We must stick to this, that a spiritual understanding is never changed, that "Now the modern days, we have to adjust things." No. That is not spiritual. There is no question of "modern" and "old." //Nitya,// that is //nitya,// eternal. We should always remember that. The... Millions and millions of years ago, what was spoken by Kṛṣṇa to the sun-god, the same thing was spoken to Arjuna. He said that "I am speaking to you the same old, //purātanaṁ yogam,// but because the //paramparā// system is now broken, so I am making again the //paramparā// system through you, beginning from you." So the //paramparā// system we can understand by Arjuna's behavior, by Arujuna's understanding. Everything is written in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. So if we follow Arjuna then we can understand //Bhagavad-gītā// very easily.

So we should not waste. If we keep it for future, then, as it is stated by Prahlāda,

> durāpūreṇa kāmena
> mohena ca balīyasā
> śeṣaṁ gṛheṣu saktasya
> pramattasyāpayāti hi
> [[books:sb:7:6:8|[SB 7.6.8]]]

If you do not practice from the very beginning, it is not possible. //Ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ// [[books:sb:2:1:6|[SB 2.1.6]]]. It is said that the greatest success of life is at the time of..., remembering Nārāyaṇa, //ante nārāyaṇa-smṛtiḥ.// Just like Ajāmila. He, at the end of his life, remembered Nārāyaṇa. So this is success. But this can be possible if we practice from the very beginning. Ajāmila, first of all, he was a //brahmacārī, brāhmaṇa,// very well behaved //brāhmaṇa,// learned everything, but due to bad association he fell down. But Kṛṣṇa gave him the opportunity... Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, na me bhakta praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. If once one has sincerely become the pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, that will never go in vain. So Kṛṣṇa saw this Ajāmila in his childhood and boyhood and youthhood a devotee, so He gave him the chance. At last, he had ten sons. The tenth son was named as Nārāyaṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa's policy, that "This rascal is forgetting Me, so I'll give him a child whose name is Nārāyaṇa." So, with reference to his son, he was chanting "Nārāyaṇa." "Nārāyaṇa, please come here, my dear son," "Nārāyaṇa, please take this food." So in this way, his account was being credited, "Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa, Nārāyaṇa." You see? So therefore he got the salvation. Similarly, if we simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and follow these principles, our life is successful. This is called //ajñāta-sukṛti.// We have to acquire //sukṛti. Sukṛti// means pious activities. //Su// means "pious," and //kṛti// means "activities." //Sukṛtino 'rjuna. Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:7:16|[Bg. 7.16]]]. Arjuna... Those who are //sukṛtina,// means one's background is pious, they begin //bhajana,// Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna. Ārto, arthārthī, jñānī, jijñāsur.// Four kinds of men---//ārto,// the one who is distressed; and //arthārthī,// one who is poor, wants some money; //jñānī,// one who wants to know what is God; //jijñāsur,// inquisitive. Such persons, if his background is piety, //sukṛtina,// then he begins //bhajana.//

So otherwise, //śeṣaṁ gṛheṣu saktasya pramattasya. Gṛheṣu saktasya,// those who are too much attached... Everyone is attached in material way of... //Gṛheṣu// means not only family; somebody is very much attached to the body. That is natural for every living being, body, bodily attachment is there. Even an animal like hog is living in filthy place and eating stool, still, he has got affection for the body. When the hog is taken from the flock for being killed, he screams very loudly, "Don't want. I don't want to be killed." Although the life is very abominable, still he's attached to the body. The old man is attached to the body. So this is called //moha. Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. Atheists... In our Los Angeles temple we have seen, there are so many //karmīs,// and when there was earthquake they screamed like anything. So no one wants to die. They say, "No, I can die." No. At the time of death they scream; they do not like. Nobody wants to die. That's a fact. So //gṛheṣu saktasya.// Generally, people become too much attached to family life. I sometimes say that in the Western countries the young boys, they come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, their only one great asset is they are not family-wise attached. That is very good qualification. Some way or other, they have become. Therefore their attachment to Kṛṣṇa becoming staunch. In India they have got organized family attachment. They are not interested. They are after money now. That I have experienced. Yes.

So family attachment is the greatest impediment in the matter of advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But if the whole family is Kṛṣṇa conscious, that is very nice. Just like Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. He was a family man, but all of them---Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, his wife, his children---and the best children is our Guru Mahārāja, best child... So he has sung by his experience, //ye dina gṛhe bhajana dekhi gṛhete goloka bhaya// [//Śaraṇāgati// 31.6]. If family-wise, everyone is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, that is very nice. That is not ordinary family. That attachment is not ordinary attachment. But generally people are attached materially. That is condemned here. //Śeṣaṁ gṛheṣu saktasya pramattasya apayāti hi.// They are called //pramatta.// Everyone is thinking that "My family, my wife, my children, my nation, my community, that is everything. What is Kṛṣṇa?" This is the greatest illusion imposed by //māyā.// But nobody will able to give you protection.

> dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣv
> ātma-sainyeṣv asatsv api
> teṣāṁ pramatto nidhanaṁ
> paśyann api na paśyati
> [[books:sb:2:1:4|[SB 2.1.4]]]

Everything will be finished. Nobody can give us any protection except Kṛṣṇa. If we want to be freed from the clutches of //māyā---janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]---we must take shelter of the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa through the spiritual master and live with devotees who have engaged themselves for the same purpose. It is called... What is that exact word? //Sakhi// or something. Now I am forgetting. But in the same category we must live and execute our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then these impediments, //gṛheṣu saktasya pramattasya...// Anyone who is..., all the //karmīs,// they are attached to this family life, but family life is good, provided there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Gṛhe vā vanete thāke, hā gaurāṅga bole dāke.// It doesn't matter, either he is in family life or he's in //sannyāsī// life, if he's a devotee, then his life is successful.

Thank you very much.
