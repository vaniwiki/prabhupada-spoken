====== Room Conversation ======

**Bṛṣākapi:**
...we have ordered. They will be arriving in two months. Also we have Prabhupāda-Bhaktisiddhānta deities. They will be coming also. We will be the first in America to have Prabhupāda, Bhaktisiddhānta and Sītā-Rāma.

**Prabhupāda:**
Here?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Yes, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

This //rasagullā// is nice.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Not as good as Keśī dāsa.

**Prabhupāda:**
They make it like Keśī dāsa, in New Vrindavan. [indistinct]

[long pause] [indistinct background whispering]

**Prabhupāda:**
There is water?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
[indistinct] Here, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...to purchase it? And he has to sell to us. Nobody will purchase.

**Rūpānuga:**
No. And we have the option secured with a deposit. Otherwise, we would not spend so much money.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, as soon as possible, you purchase it. Six hundred thousand?

**Rūpānuga:**
Six-fifty.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
We have purchased. In effect, we have already purchased, Prabhupāda. It is ours.

**Rūpānuga:**
It is just that we have ten years to get more money.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
It's cheaper to make the payments than to try and buy.

**Prabhupāda:**
But Rāmeśvara has not agreed to pay?

**Rūpānuga:**
No, we do not have to get money from BBT this way. This way we do not have to take loan. It is good, because BBT does not have that much money.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, we need supply money to India. Depend on Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa will supply.

**Vipina:**
//Jaya.// That happened just about less than a month ago. Some gentleman who was a Seventh Day Adventist, he became interested and started to call and come by, and listened to the philosophy, and even listened to your tapes. And then shortly after that he gave a donation of five thousand dollars. We bought with it some chandeliers for Kṛṣṇa's temple for you to see tomorrow.

**Prabhupāda:**
Five thousand dollars?

**Vipina:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't misspend.

**Vipina:**
Not all on chandeliers. Just part of it.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
You have a bell system?

**Rūpānuga:**
Yes, it rings, but you can't hear it in here. It rings in the back quarters.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. I'll just go in there.

**Prabhupāda:**
The doors you have purchased?

**Rūpānuga:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is costly?

**Vipina:**
Yes.

**Rūpānuga:**
The other doors were not..., they could not even be locked nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice.

**Vipina:**
We got matching doors all the way through your quarters.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
We are hoping if you like it, you will stay here, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
I want to stay, but...

**Rūpānuga:**
...cannot.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Where's the bell? I want to test the buzzer.

**Rūpānuga:**
On the other side, it works. This Washington temple actually is one of your oldest centers, but this is the first time you have been able to come when facilities were proper. So we have...

**Prabhupāda:**
Indians are coming?

**Rūpānuga:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They come on the Love Feast?

**Rūpānuga:**
They come to the Sunday feast.

**Vipina:**
They are starting to come more now. With the changes we made in the temple, and they are being very much impressed that we are doing nicely, and they want to become a part.

**Prabhupāda:**
I heard that Ambassador, you have made some engagement?

**Vipina:**
Prabhupāda, he..., I got a call from his secretary, and I've been working on it, and I've been to his house once. He has a very nice, stately house. He had requested that maybe you could come there to his home, and your servant and Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa were thinking it might be hard for you to travel there. So we're trying to convince him to come here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. There is no question of insisting. They cannot help us in any way.

**Vipina:**
No, not at all.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have tried all these. They are useless.

**Bṛṣākapi:**
We have written all the Parliament, and we have asked them to come, but they are too busy.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you go and take rest.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya. Haribol.//

**Prabhupāda:**
There is much time difference from...?

**Vipina:**
From...?

**Bṛṣākapi:**
Ten-thirty. It's ten-thirty now.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, New Vrindavan and...?

**Devotees:**
Same time, New Vrindavan.

**Rūpānuga:**
Should I close this, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
I'm going to the bedroom.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like a fan that doesn't make so much noise, perhaps? A fan in here?

**Prabhupāda:**
May be required.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. [end]
