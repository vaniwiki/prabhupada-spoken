Translation: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme controller, who is infallible and indefatigable, is present in different forms of life, from the inert living beings [//sthāvara//], such as the plants, to Brahmā, the foremost created living being. He is also present in the varieties of material creations and in the material elements, the total material energy and the modes of material nature [//sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// and //tamo-guṇa//], as well as the unmanifested material nature and the false ego. Although He is one, He is present everywhere, and He is also the transcendental Supersoul, the cause of all causes, who is present as the observer in the cores of the hearts of all living entities. He is indicated as that which is pervaded and as the all-pervading Supersoul, but actually He cannot be indicated. He is changeless and undivided. He is simply perceived as the supreme //sac-cid-ānanda// [eternity, knowledge and bliss]. Being covered by the curtain of the external energy, to the atheist He appears nonexistent."

**Prabhupāda:**
So this is the description of the Absolute Truth. [to Svarūpa Dāmodara:] You can explain in your own way. Just stand up and explain. They'll be glad. The Absolute Truth, explanation.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The Absolute Truth?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, you can explain in your scientific way. [laughter]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We impose that, ah...

**Prabhupāda:**
Stand up and say. They'll be glad to hear. [laughter]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
We make a prerequisite, saying that in order to understand the difference between life and matter, the basic requirement is to have some understanding of the Absolute Truth. Just like in mathematics and physics and in chemistry, there are certain axioms from which the knowledge... [break] ...and theories are produced from these axioms. [indistinct] Similarly, if one would accept Absolute Truth, the axiom of the truth, in order to understand the basic meaning of God, the difference between life and matter, the requirement is very scientific process, they say axioms, actions that can be proven. They say the Absolute Truth cannot be proven by [indistinct]. So we take Absolute Truth source of everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. In the //Bhagavad-gītā,// the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa, is explaining Himself. Absolute Truth is the ultimate end, //Vedānta.// The subject matter of knowledge is Absolute Truth. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// So we have got this human form of life to inquire about the Absolute Truth. //Jijñāsuḥ śreyaḥ uttamam. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreyaḥ uttamam// [SB 11.3.21]. Unless one is //jijñāsuḥ,// inquisitive, there is no need of accept a so-called fashionable //guru.// To accept //guru// is not a fashion, style, that "Everyone has //guru;// I'll have a //guru.//" No. The //śāstra// says, //tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreyaḥ uttamam:// One should accept //guru// when he is inquisitive, //jijñāsuḥ.// What about? //Śreyaḥ uttamam,// the Absolute, or the auspicity, beyond this material world. //Uttamam. Tamaḥ// means darkness, ignorance.

So here, our position in this material world: darkness. We are simply speculating in so many ways what is the ultimate cause. There are so many philosophers, but they are speculating only, without any definite knowledge. So //śāstra// says that speculative knowledge will not be successful at any time. In the //Brahma-saṁhitā// it is said that //panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo vāyor athāpi manaso muni-puṅgavānām// [Bs. 5.34]. //Manaso,// by mental speculation, //muni-puṅgavānām.// One who speculates, he is called //muni.// So //muni-puṅgava. Puṅgava// means the most exalted //muni,// if he simply speculates about the Absolute Truth, how many years? //Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara.//

Just like people are now going in the outer space to find out some shelter in the moon planet, in the Mars planet, similarly, if you want to find out the Absolute Truth or the abode of the Absolute Truth... The description is there in the //śāstra://

> goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya
> devī-maheśa-hari-dhāmasu teṣu teṣu
> te te prabhāva-nicayā vihitāś ca yena
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.43]

The topmost planet in the spiritual sky is the..., called Goloka. That is Kṛṣṇa's place. //Goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni.// And below this there are Vaikuṇṭha-dhāmas, unlimited number of Vaikuṇṭha-dhāmas. //Goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya devī-maheśa.// Devī-dhāma. This is called Devī-dhāma, this material world. And Maheśa-dhāma, the Śivaloka. And //devī-mahesa, hari-dhāmasu. Hari-dhāmasu// means Vaikuṇṭha. So these are the different status of //dhāma.// We cannot calculate, estimate even this Devī-dhāma. This is called Devī-dhāma. This material world is called Devī-dhāma. It is controlled by Devī, goddess Durgā.

> sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā
> chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā
> icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.44]

So this Devī-dhāma is being controlled by the most powerful energy, Durga. //Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir eka.// But she's acting as //chāyeva,// a shadow of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also summarized in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ
> sūyate sa-carācaram
> hetunānena kaunteya
> jagad viparivartate
> [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]

So in this way, if we study through the //śāstra,// everything is there. If you want to find out the Absolute Truth, how? //Śāstra cakṣuṣāt:// through the //śāstras,// through the Vedic knowledge, you'll find the Absolute Truth. If we actually accept that //Veda// means knowledge... //Vetthi veda vida jñāne. Veda// means knowledge, //jñāna.// So //Veda-anta,// the last, last phase of knowledge. The last phase of knowledge is the Absolute Truth. You have to go up to that. So that Absolute Truth, if you go on speculating, //panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo// [Bs. 5.34], that will not be possible. //Śata-vatsara-sampragamyo,// by hundreds and hundreds of years, if you go on with speed... What is that speed? //Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-sampragamyo vāyor athāpi.// Aeroplane, airplane, //vāyor athāpi.// And what is the speed? //Vāyor athāpi. Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara sampragamyo vāyor athāpi. Manaso vayu:// by the speed of air and mind. Mind is very speedy. You are sitting here, you can immediately remember ten thousand miles away, it is so speedy. So even by the mind's speed you cannot, by going over the space, //koṭi-śata-vatsara,// many millions of years still it remains unknown. So this is not the way to understand the Absolute Truth, but if we accept the Vedic process, //avaroha panthā,// when the knowledge comes from the Absolute Truth, then it is possible.

So we Kṛṣṇa conscious, I mean to say, devotees, we try to understand the Absolute Truth by the grace of the Absolute Truth. The Absolute Truth is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "I am the Supreme." //Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. In this way, if we try to understand Kṛṣṇa as He is speaking, as they are stated in the //śāstra,// as it is accepted by the //ācāryas,// then we can have some trace of the Absolute Truth. Just like Kṛṣṇa says,

> athavā bahunaitena
> kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna
> viṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam
> ekāṁśena sthito jagat
> [[books:bg:10:42|[Bg. 10.42]]]

The expansion of the Absolute Truth, how it is working, so Kṛṣṇa summarized before Arjuna that this material world, material world... //Ekāṁśena sthito jagat,// this material world. What is that material world? This material world, we see only one universe to our vision. Similarly, there are millions of universes. //Yasya prabhā prabhavato jadad-aṇḍa koṭi// [Bs. 5.40]. //Jagad-aṇḍa// means one universe, and in each universe, //koṭiṣu aśeṣa. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭisv aśeṣu vibhūti-bhinnam// [Bs. 5.40]. There are millions of planets, and each planet is different from here. That is God's creation. So all this together, //ekāṁśena sthito jagat,// this material world is one-fourth part exhibition of God's creation. And three-fourths' part is in the Vaikuṇṭhaloka, spiritual world. So by speculation, by our research, it is impossible, but we can get a glimpse of knowledge of the Absolute Truth when we receive it through the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.

Thank you very much.
