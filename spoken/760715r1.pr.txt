====== Conversation at Gītā-nagarī Farm ======

[Hari Sauri Prabhu’s comment: "Looks genuine. We were in Gita Nagari for the day and Bali, Cyavana, TKG were all there. Buy more land was Prabhupada's usual response to the question of increasing sizes of herds."]

**Paramānanda:**
Prabhupāda, our cows are multiplying very quickly, so we were wondering, we have figured out that by the end of two years we will have as many cows as we can support off this land. We'll have 100 cows. So we were wondering...

**Prabhupāda:**
So get more land.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
The land is very costly, Prabhupāda. This land cost $350,000.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, no. We purchase somewhere land and keep the cows there... cattle there grazing.

**Bali Mardan:**
Grazing land... down south... year-round land.

**Devakīnandana:**
Would the cows be milked there or would they just be allowed to graze?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, whatever you can milk you keep here. Otherwise let them graze there.

**Bali Mardan:**
Like all the bulls that are not being utilized.

**Prabhupāda:**
They will eat grass and grow, nature's way.

**Paramānanda:**
We were just concerned that there would be so many good milk cows that we wouldn't be able to utilize.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not? You take milk and turn into ghee. You can sell it.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
The problem he's suggesting is that after a while there will be so many milk cows that they won't have any room for them here either. In other words, they are multiplying in such a number, what is to be done?

**Bali Mardan:**
One idea that I had was that they should not breed them so quickly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Kṛṣṇa was maintaining 900,000 cows. Do you think you will have more than that? [laughter]

**Paramānanda:**
We figure at the end of ten years we'll have 2000.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's alright. You have seen the pictures how many thousands of cows He has taken to the pasturing grounds?

**Bali Mardan:**
So simply we have to buy enough land for them to graze on. That is, our duty, to buy the land.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Caivana:**
Because these cows are such high quality, they could be taken to our other farms. If they have too many here we could take them to our other farms because they are the best cows in the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devakīnandana:**
But all the other farms will have the same problem with too many cows. There is another problem Śrīla Prabhupāda. It is very difficult to find people who are qualified to protect the cows properly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Add some land and let them graze there. That's all.

**Bali Mardan:**
Keep the ones that produce the most milk here, for milk.

**Prabhupāda:**
Somehow or other, don't kill them. That's all.

**Bali Mardan:**
So also they can simply graze. They don't have to breed them to produce calves. They can simply graze. It's no problem.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
If they keep them all together, won't they mate?

**Bali Mardan:**
You have to castrate the bulls.

**Hari Śauri:**
If we protect the cows nicely, then Kṛṣṇa will supply everything we need for doing that.

**Prabhupāda:**
The cow will supply milk and from milk you can produce ghee and you can sell and make profit.

**Devotee:**
Butter is very expensive today.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you can make and sell it.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
Right now we are selling some of the extra milk. How much are we getting every month?

**Devakīnandana:**
$1,500.

**Tamal Kṛṣṇa:**
Already we are getting $1,500 per month from sale of the milk products.

**Prabhupāda:**
That $1,500, $1,000 you keep for purchasing land.

**Devotee:**
You say in your books, Prabhupāda, that this cow protection is the greatest thing for....

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, Kṛṣṇa did it. [end]
