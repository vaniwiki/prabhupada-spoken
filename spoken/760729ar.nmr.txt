====== Arrival at Farm ======

[at apartment at chateau]

**Bhagavān:**
Most are at the farm, waiting. Here there is about sixty; the rest are there. They told me that after I told them that you might not come, the next morning at //maṅgala ārtik// no one was dancing.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] I know that. Therefore I come in this old age to encourage the devotees. [coughs] Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare.

**Bhagavān:**
There is nice water here, from the source. We have a source.

**Prabhupāda:**
From?

**Bhagavān:**
There is a source, a natural spring not far from here, and people take their water.

**Prabhupāda:**
You all bring all drinking water from there?

**Bhagavān:**
No, yours.

[pause]

**Bhagavān:**
Here, we are an hour ahead.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Bhagavān:**
One hour ahead, 12:20. We have bitter melon and all fruits and vegetables, everything.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who will cook?

**Bhagavān:**
We have Mandākinī...

**Prabhupāda:**
Mandākinī has not cooked very nice last.

**Bhagavān:**
There is Aditi; there is... The wife of Hari-vilāsa, she cooked for you before.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, she can cook.

**Bhagavān:**
What is for lunch? Bitter melon?

**Prabhupāda:**
Bitter melon, you teach them how to do it.

**Bhagavān:**
//Samosā?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Not necessarily. Simply prepare nice //ḍāl,// nice rice, vegetable, some bitter melon, and two, three //cāpāṭis,// that's all. Not cumberous. Must be well cooked, rice. That's all.

**Bhagavān:**
//Mung ḍāl,// is all right? //Mung ḍāl?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mung ḍāl,// yes.

**Bhagavān:**
//Mung ḍāl.//

**Prabhupāda:**
It boils nicely? Any //ḍāl// which boils nicely, that's all right. Without being boiled, it is useless.

[long pause; background discussion as devotees arrange things]

**Prabhupāda:**
Is it working or not? [referring to the bell]

**Devotee:**
Yes. We tried it yesterday, it was working.

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't think it is working.

**Devotee:**
It's not working.

**French devotee:**
Yesterday we tried everything. It was working, I know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is there any buzzing? No.

**French devotee:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Is there any buzzing?

**Devotee:**
From the buzzer.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

[background discussion as devotees fix the bell] [coughing]

**Bhagavān:**
Where is that //loṭā// for Prabhupāda?

**Harikeśa:**
I told them two o'clock their time, which is one o'clock your time from London, because there's a compromise of..., in between the two, and in that way it would adjust.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Harikeśa:**
I also told them not to make anything fancy, but to make very simple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who? They will not be able.

**Harikeśa:**
Hari-vilāsa's wife? Parijāta?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, she's...

**Harikeśa:**
She's here.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Harikeśa:**
So I explained to her, and Arundhatī's going to show her the cooker and everything, so...

**Prabhupāda:**
Arundhatī cannot. She cannot.

**Harikeśa:**
No, she's not so... She knows the mechanics of it, but the details are difficult. When we get to the farm there is a separate kitchen, and every spare minute I will be with him and just teach him everything in great detail. [break]

[lecture, translated into French throughout]

**Prabhupāda:**
So I am very glad to see you again in this village.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. It was the prediction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that in every village, in every town on the surface of the globe, there will be preaching of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's name and the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// [aside:] It is to be translated? So by your transcendental endeavor it is being fulfilled, otherwise who expected that in this remote village of France, Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// would be chanted?

**Devotees:**
//Jaya! Haribol!// [devotees cheer and clap hands]

**Prabhupāda:**
When Caitanya Mahāprabhu said in every village, in every town, He did not mean that every village and every town in India. He specifically says //pṛthivīte,// means on the surface of the globe. So the purpose is that without spreading of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, nobody can become happy. That's a fact. The opportunity of human form of life is systematcially being refused by the modern civilization. This material activity only for the bodily comforts of life, that is not human civilization. Human civilization means the human being must know the supreme controller and the aim of life. The real fact is that God is there, the supreme controller, and we living entities, we are His parts and parcels. As parts and parcels of God, we, being separated, we are suffering. An example can be given in this connection, just like a small child is the part and parcel of the body of the mother. So the child is happy when the child is on the lap of the mother. That means the part and the whole must live together. Then there is happiness. Otherwise, there is distress. The modern godless civilization is making the part and the whole separated. Therefore the whole condition is chaotic. You have got experience in your this part of the globe, within fifty years there have been two big, big wars and... Many other parts also. People are not in happiness, on account of godlessness. So actually if we want to be happy in this life and the next life, then we must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And it is not at all difficult: simply chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// So I am very glad that you are accustomed to chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Stick to it and you'll all be happy.

Thank you very much.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol! Jaya!// [break]

[in room]

**Bhagavān:**
These are all smelling flowers. They're very sweet, like gardenia.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, developed[?] in our garden.

**Bhagavān:**
No, we bought. These we cannot grow. We bought these special.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have got a greenhouse?

**Bhagavān:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Still you cannot grow?

**Bhagavān:**
It was too late. We started too late.

**Prabhupāda:**
Last time I stayed in this room?

**Bhagavān:**
No, you stayed in another room. You stayed in my office. This is silk wallpaper.

**Prabhupāda:**
These are...?

**Bhagavān:**
Silk. Saffron.

**Prabhupāda:**
Organize this center very nicely. So many people will be happy.

**Bhagavān:**
The devotees are very ecstatic.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Bhagavān:**
The devotees there are very ecstatic to see you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Yes, there was no hope of my coming. Now I've come, they must be. [laughter] Sunshine will stay at least up to noon, huh?

**Bhagavān:**
No, till five o'clock.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Acchā?//

**Bhagavān:**
Yes. It is going like this. It goes from this room into your room. All day long it is lit. They said it was hot in this room until six o'clock last night, very hot.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Bhagavān:**
If you'd like, I can show you how to use some things in the bathroom.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Bhagavān:**
All the taps, they are the same. The red here, this is hot. All you do is lift up. [break] And the cows are also coming here, you can see later. These are all big oak trees. They are very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Harikeśa, have you came here?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes.

**Bhagavān:**
All the marble, I had it made in Italy especially for you. This is all lotus flower carving they have done. And the bookshelves also.

**Prabhupāda:**
This also marble?

**Bhagavān:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh!

**Bhagavān:**
Everything is designed for Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I can use this closet?

**Bhagavān:**
Oh, all these are closets.

**Hari-śauri:**
Lockable one.

**Harikeśa:**
Lockable closets.

**Bhagavān:**
These are many pillows. If people come, they can sit.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Very nice, so you can keep here. [background discussion about keys and closets] [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
It's coming in a few minutes. Have to order that.

**Bhagavān:**
What is that?

**Hari-śauri:**
Tapioca.

**Prabhupāda:**
Is there any store here near?

**Bhagavān:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not immediately. Just... Or you have got barley powder?

**Bhagavān:**
They are getting this morning. They are taking it to get ground.

**Prabhupāda:**
Immediately, there is no stock?

**Bhagavān:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**

> yasya deve parā bhaktir
> yathā deve tathā gurau
> tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ
> prakāśante mahātmanaḥ
> [ŚU 6.23]

This desire to serve //guru// is the qualification. //Yasya deve para bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau.// In the spiritual life, this is the secret of success. //Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā...// In many places. Our Gauḍīya Matha people, those who were leaders, they wanted to supersede the order of Guru Mahārāja. Therefore it was failure. Very, very nice.

**Bhagavān:**
They have painted that nice picture. It's special board.

**Prabhupāda:**
All books are here?

**Bhagavān:**
Oh, yes. Some are missing from the Seventh Canto, but most are here. Here is //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// And if you have books you need, they can go down here, your reference books. I got you this little box here...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Bhagavān:**
...if you wanted to keep anything special. They used to make things for the princes. This is comfortable seat?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Very good.

**Bhagavān:**
Table is close enough?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Everything is comfortable. These stones are not available in India. Maybe; very costly. Italian.

**Bhagavān:**
This is from Portugal. The white is from Italy. They have put the different marbles together.

**Prabhupāda:**
Combination.

**Bhagavān:**
Very expert. They have also made your Vyāsasana.

**Prabhupāda:**
That one. So this side, marble is cheaper?

**Bhagavān:**
Yes, it's very..., it's not expensive.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. They have done very nice this furniture. We cannot expect this furniture in India. They may make, but it will be very costly. [coughs] You bring one spittoon.

**French devotee:**
Yes, we are waiting it.

**Prabhupāda:**
How many devotees are there?

**Bhagavān:**
Hundred and fifty.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. They are all happy?

**Bhagavān:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let them come and work little, grow food, eat and chant. Why should they bother going to the factory, running at five o'clock? Horrible life, horrible civilization. Motor accident, delayed, anxiety: "Oh, I am delayed, I am delayed." What is this civilization?

**Bhagavān:**
He is taking over there. You take here?

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, I shall begin there. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

[whispered discussion as devotees bring things in; looking for silver cup]

**Devotee:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Jaya.// [end]
