====== Morning Walk Around Grounds ======

**Prabhupāda:**
It requires much water. Then sow grains. [break]

**Devotee (1):**
This is from the previous owner, Prabhupāda. He's agreed to take the graves away. He is simply finding another place for them. It's part of the contract we made with him, that he had to remove them.

**Prabhupāda:**
This land?

**Bhagavān:**
That is the proprietor's land on this side.

**Prabhupāda:**
And he does not find any land to move the graves.

**Bhagavān:**
What was that, Śrīla Prabhupāda? He has so much land?

**Devotee (1):**
There is a law by which it's very difficult to move graves anywhere. So he's trying to get permission from the //maire// to do it. [break]

**Bhagavān:**
...built a big factory here to engage people who were socially misfit, and he was making all kinds of plastic toys. So when we moved in, we suggested that he help manufacture Spiritual Sky. So now almost his whole factory is being used.

**Devotee (2):**
One of his workers has [indistinct].

**Bhagavān:**
Many young Indian boys who have come to France looking for something, they had no money. So he has employed them here. So they're working, they've brought their families.

**Prabhupāda:**
They're established.

**Bhagavān:**
Yes, and he's building them houses.

**Devotee (2):**
There's one there.

**Bhagavān:**
Yes. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
I think it's unusual in Europe.

**Bhagavān:**
It's like this every July and August, very sunny. During these months most people in Europe come to France.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [break]

**Bhagavān:**
...storage house.

**Prabhupāda:**
What does he manufacture?

**Bhagavān:**
Manufactures some boats and plastic things.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is box?

**Devotee (2):**
Spiritual Sky, perfume bottles. [break]

**Bhagavān:**
It's a quarry for stone. The same kind of stone that the chateau is built from.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Bhagavān:**
This is the factory here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Factory of the proprietor? The proprietor?

**Bhagavān:**
Yes, and he rents to Spiritual Sky.

**Devotee (3):**
[inside warehouse] These incense packs, packs we use. We are reorganizing the stock now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where you are selling?

**Devotee (3):**
Everywhere in France. We're doing now also Germany and also Holland and Belgium.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where it is printed?

**Hari-śauri:**
These are all from the US, I think.

**Devotee (3):**
No, now it's from France. We started a few months ago, from France. Everything now is organized in France.

**Prabhupāda:**
These are all essential oils?

**Devotee (3):**
Yes, this is all perfume here. We have pure sandalwood from India. It is getting very expensive now.

**Devotee (2):**
This is our Indian packages, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotee:**
What's this for? [indistinct]

**Devotee (4):**
We're changing the design on this package. We have Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. Then we put the picture of Gopāla Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
When it is nice, why you are changing it? Unnecessary spending is not...

**Devotee (4):**
We're going to use these... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...the sticks?

**Devotee (3):**
From China.

**Prabhupāda:**
What are in these bags?

**Devotee (3):**
This is for making henna.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Devotee (3):**
We're specializing in henna.

**Prabhupāda:**
Honey?

**Devotee (3):**
Henna.

**Hari-śauri:**
What's that?

**Devotee (3):**
Henna is for the hair. And we're going to produce ten different coloring hennas. This is actually a custom.

**Devotee:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda's used to the powder. [break]

**Devotee (3):**
Leaf of acacia making noncoloring henna.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where you get?

**Devotee (3):**
This is coming from India, I think. But we have found acacia in... There's much acacia in France, and so we're going to pick it ourselves. This will make us a producer, which will increase our profit.

**Bhagavān:**
Spiritual Sky is paying right now almost eighty thousand dollars a year to the association here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Devotee (3):**
This is... We're doing two lines now. Were doing a cheaper line called Scented Garden, and the more expensive. This is for the cheaper customers.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is scent?

**Devotee (4):**
They're different, different flavors.

**Devotee (5):**
This is the cheaper oil. [laughter]

**Devotee (4):**
They're making the prisms here.

**Devotee (3):**
This belongs to the previous owner of the chateau. He let us use these machines. He also helps us make very nice stands for displaying. These here are some for putting in the henna for coloring, making different colors. These boxes come from India also, we think.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this, sand?

**Devotee (3):**
This belongs to the owner of the factory. [break]

**Bhagavān:**
It stays light until quarter to eleven here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Like Moscow also. I was there in June or July. Sarasvatī, you like this place?

**Hari-śauri:**
You like this place?

**Sarasvatī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this?

**Devotee (3):**
This is bath oil, putting in the bath.

**Prabhupāda:**
Santal?

**Devotee (3):**
Sandalwood. And this is the more expensive quality. [laughter] This is actually pure sandalwood, a little diluted.

**Prabhupāda:**
Jagadiśa's son? Oh.

**Bhagavān:**
Nirmala.

**Hari-śauri:**
You want to ride in the palanquin?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. We can sit down on the palanq... [break] Snake here?

**Devotee (4):**
Little ones.

**Devotee (5) :**
There are some, yes.

**Devotee (2):**
There's a big one in the forest. It has not got any water in yet. It is very big.

**Devotees:**
Snake? [laughter]

**Bhagavān:**
He thought you said lake.

**Prabhupāda:**
Python?

**Hari-śauri:**
No. He thought you said a lake. So he said there's a big one in the forest. But you were talking about a snake.

**Prabhupāda:**
Snake, yes. There is a big snake here? [laughter]

**Hari-śauri:**
No. He was talking about a lake, for water.

[pause]

**Bhagavān:**
//Kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [//kīrtana// begins] [end]
