====== Evening Walk [partially recorded] ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, can I see? [break]

**Bhagavān:**
[aside:] Is it clean? Carnations, and these are gladiolus, for the vases, those long flowers. This is the chili peppers over here, green peppers. What's the best way to go, Haribol? Over here?

**Haribolānanda:**
...wants to see over there? The flowers and everything? [break] [tape of Prabhupāda singing in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
...that this voice does not belong to this universe.

**Devotees:**
//Haribol!//

**Prabhupāda:**
That is the secret. It is imported from the spiritual world. //Golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana. Golokera.// It is coming from Goloka Vṛndāvana.

[sings //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu-nityānanda//]

[pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
That girl has returned? No.

**Hari-śauri:**
That girl from Thailand? She's still in Paris?

**Bhagavān:**
She's in Paris.

**Hari-śauri:**
She's still in Paris. [end]
