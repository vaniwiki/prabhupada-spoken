====== Evening Darśana ======

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all.

**Devotee:**
Thank you.

**Prabhupāda:**
So mind, his business is to think something. But ordinarily the thinking is we accept something and reject something. Or accept the same thing and again reject the same thing. This business is going on. But if you think of question, there is no question of rejecting. Simply accepting. Then it is fixed up. Other things you accept and reject. Something we accept as "Oh, it is very good." Again, "No, no, it is not good." Accepting. Childish. Child is playing, one type of playing, "No, no, another one." That is material. And when you fix up---no rejection, simply accept it---that is Kṛṣṇa... So if you think of Kṛṣṇa... Just like here is temple. If you come and, as other devotees are doing, if you do, if you attend //maṅgala-ārati,// if you attend //bhoga-ārati,// always see, then offer obeisances, then naturally you will think of Kṛṣṇa always. Then as you think of Kṛṣṇa, you become purified. Just like if you touch with fire you remain always warm. Similarly, //man-manā,// if you always think of Kṛṣṇa, you gradually become fully Kṛṣṇa-ized, Kṛṣṇa's devotee, Kṛṣṇa's servant. That is perfection. There is no difficulty. People will not do that. That is the difficulty. "Why shall I think of Kṛṣṇa? I shall think of this, I shall think of that." This is the difficulty. Otherwise not difficulty. You have to think something; think of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Finished. [Hindi with guest] //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. //Duṣkṛtinaḥ.// [Hindi] //Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. [Hindi] Beating with shoes by //māyā,// that's all. [Hindi] [someone enters]

Oh, when you have come?

**Woman:**
This morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
I was thinking of you.

**Woman:**
Oh, yes?

**Prabhupāda:**
So did you go to Bangkok?

**Woman:**
No, I'm going very soon.

**Prabhupāda:**
[converses in Hindi] //Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. [Hindi conversation] Indian Māyāvādīs are more dangerous. [Hindi] Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, //māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa// [[books:cc:madhya:6:169|[Cc. Madhya 6.169]]]. Anyone who is influenced by Māyāvādī, he's doomed.

**Indian man:**
He's doomed.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's finished. No more spiritual knowledge. He's doomed.

**Indian man:**
How far the study of the scriptures helps us in being Kṛṣṇa conscious?

**Prabhupāda:**
You read //Bhagavad-gītā.// That is the essence of all scriptures. And follow it. It is, from the very beginning to the end, it is simply helping you. You haven't got to read many literatures. Just like these American, European boys, they are with me for the last, utmost seven, eight years. Otherwise, three years, four years. So how are they becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious? It is not at all difficult. They are accepting //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and becoming perfect. But in India: "Why shall I worship Kṛṣṇa? I have got this, I have got that." He'll bring thousands of Kṛṣṇa competitors, and he'll himself, he has become Kṛṣṇa: "I am God." You see? He's so shameless that he says that "I am God." God is so cheap. He's shameless. He has no shame even, how he says that he is God? //Māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.// So-called //jñānī// means //māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.//

**Indian man:**
//Māyāvādī?//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Māyayā apahṛta-jñāna. Māyā.// [Hindi conversation] Who is very, very much under the influence of //māyā,// he is Māyāvādī. Unless he is too much under the influence of //māyā,// how he can say that "I am God"? Which is impossible. [Hindi] So many things which makes one //rāja,// and if you simply imagine, "I am //rāja,//" so how much rascal he is, just see. //Mūḍha. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. [Hindi] //Māyāvādi-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa// [[books:cc:madhya:6:169|[Cc. Madhya 6.169]]]. If one follow the Māyāvādīs and thinks that "I am God," then he is finished. His future is finished. [long conversation in Hindi] That is very nice, that "I have got a protector." [conversation in Hindi]

**Indian man:**
He can be fearless, free.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. He's fearless. Natural. I have seen in my practical life. Long ago I was going in a tram car. So my son, he was two years old. The conductor: "//Paisa, amsa." Bolte.//[?] [Hindi] "Hah! //Mana pitājī he!//" [Hindi] He's confident, "My father is there. How he can get me down?" This is natural. //Sanātha-jīvitam. Kadāham aikāntika-nitya-kiṅkaraḥ praharṣayiṣyāmi.// That is //ānanda,// that "I have no fear. I have got my father here. I have got my protector." //Sanātha-jīvitam.// That is...
