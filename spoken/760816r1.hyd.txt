====== Room Conversation ======

**Hari-śauri:**

They are already cutting the animals premature. There is no [Hindi]. [Hindi conversation] //Choti// aeroplane. Who is pilot? Very small. Minute. Just like construction like aeroplane. Who is pilot still? Answer him. Ask the scientist. [Hindi conversation; Indian lady also speaking] Among the whole world she knows this.

Indian man: Pālikā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Pālikā.

**Indian man:**
Yes. She has gone yesterday.

**Harikeśa:**
She learned here.

**Indian man:**

**Prabhupāda:**

**Indian man:**

**Prabhupāda:**
East to west. [Hindi] Where is Mahāṁśa Mahārāja? He is not here?

**Devotee:**
Can somebody go find Mahāṁśa?

**Devotee (2):**
He was here. Just probably bringing some things for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. So? We have got the key? Not here.

**Devotee:**

**Prabhupāda:**
So, //kīrtana// [Hindi]?
