====== Room Conversation ======

[loud //kīrtana// in background]

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything is all right?

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Let him dance[?]. Wherefrom you are coming?

**Acyutānanda:**
From Calcutta. Māyāpur, Calcutta.

**Prabhupāda:**
My health is not well.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes, I have heard. We brought you some medicine from your sister.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh!

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I wrote her.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes. We have that with us.

**Prabhupāda:**
So. Everything all right?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Everything all right to have your //darśana,// Śrīla Prabhupāda. We have heard that you are not feeling well.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Acyutānanda:**
Everyone in Calcutta, they are asking how you are. Many people, they are anxious to see you. We have gotten very good recent publicity there. Three days in a row.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Acyutānanda:**
Three days in a row of front page news articles.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is they are publishing?

**Acyutānanda:**
Very good. Many ministers are also coming to Māyāpur. It's very...

**Prabhupāda:**
Here also the chief minister, [indistinct].

**Devotee:**
Yesterday.

**Prabhupāda:**
Chief minister came yesterday. [indistinct]

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes, he is okay. [indistinct background conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
Gradually they will appreciate. Everyone, all over the world.

**Acyutānanda:**
This was on the front page of the //Ananda Bazar,// five //lakhs'// circulation.

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct] Māyāpur.

**Acyutānanda:**
Front page.

**Gargamuni:**
This is in the answer...

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh?

**Gargamuni:**
This is the answer to those accusations made by the...

**Acyutānanda:**
By the CPI. This is in answer. They came and did a full report with tape recorders, movie cameras. This newspaper.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can send this copy to Delhi for those ministers who want it.

**Acyutānanda:**
Those. Oh yes. This is the largest circulation in India.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This probably came in the big [indistinct] yesterday. [indistinct] has been enclosed the xerox copies already. With the front page, we can get it translated...

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...so that they can read it.

**Acyutānanda:**
Right. [//kīrtana// in background; devotees talking]

**Hari-śauri:**
So Prabhupada can lecture and he doesn't have to go down. [indistinct conversation]

**Acyutānanda:**
Wow. He just sits right here. Perfect. Also, this came the day before, in the same newspaper. [indistinct conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
You directly prove that "We are not CIA." //Kṛṣṇa-nāma// [indistinct].

**Acyutānanda:**
And Bhavananda invited the CPI [Communist Party of India] members to come to Māyāpur and see for themselves.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah!

**Acyutānanda:**
This article invites them.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These members are now in Delhi, so we can send it to them.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These members are all in Delhi. And when I write the letter which you dictated, we will also enclose it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. They published one English article, "Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement Catches On."

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay.

**Prabhupāda:**
In //Ananda Bazar.//

**Hari-śauri:**
It's that magazine called //Sunday.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah, hah.

**Hari-śauri:**
We saw it in New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
Somewhere I saw.

**Hari-śauri:**
New York.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice article.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes, about thirteen pages in the magazine.

**Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, really.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes, very long, three quarters of the magazine.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is this?

**Acyutānanda:**
That's an income tax form. I pasted these on the back.

**Prabhupāda:**
That CPI member, what does he say?

**Acyutānanda:**
Well, apparently they're a little bit envious because Māyāpur is becoming very popular amongst the local people. We get five thousand people now for the... Five thousand people are coming for the //prasādam.// And even the Congress leaders, they come here and eat with the people. They said, "This is wonderful."

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is that?

**Acyutānanda:**
At Māyāpur.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is a unique. In these days we are...

**Acyutānanda:**
And Jayapatāka is going to the villages. I gave him one bus, and he is selling about six to seven hundred //Gītār Gāns// a day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Acyutānanda:**
Six to seven hundred //Gītār Gāns// are being sold each day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Sixty...

**Acyutānanda:**
Six hundred.

**Prabhupāda:**
Six to seven hundred.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes. Each day.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You'll run out of those pretty...

**Jayapatāka:**
We'll be finished in two months with those thirty thousand.

**Acyutānanda:**
And the response is wonderful within the villages. They all say "Hare Kṛṣṇa," everywhere.

**Prabhupāda:**
They are envious of this, certainly.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
How people are receiving this movement all over the world, even minister to the Communist party. They are trying to kill God, and we are putting God. We are the greatest enemy.

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Jayapatāka:**
Show that other article that... This is the actual article against us. The one against us.

**Acyutānanda:**
Also this came in the //Statesman,// the pro–vice-chancellor of Calcutta University came to Māyāpur. He wants to affiliate Māyāpur with the Calcutta University. This came in the //Statesman.// And a few days ago, the vice-chancellor...

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not yet finished?

**Jayapatāka:**
That's the old picture.

**Acyutānanda:**
No, this picture's six months old.

**Jayapatāka:**
It's more than half.

**Acyutānanda:**
It's more than that.

**Jayapatāka:**
We're working on the roofs now. We've received ten //lakhs// so far. The building total cost was twenty //lakhs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[indistinct]

**Jayapatāka:**
Each building, six times longer than our building. Two hundred rooms.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is against us?

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes. This is the first article. [break] The first article. That was against us, in the same paper. Then these two came. But it was very good. Many people came to the temple. They said, "Your Society is cleared." Many Bengalis, so many came, "We have read, 'Your Society is cleared.' "

**Prabhupāda:**
Now it is even more cleared. We have got so many [indistinct]. [end]
