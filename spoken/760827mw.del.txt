====== Morning Walk at Lodi Gardens ======

**Mahāṁsa:**
Everything he was saying is what he has learned from the Ramakrishna Society.

**Prabhupāda:**
There are so many gentlemen who have become poisoned by this nonsense. [break] [//japa//] //Jaya.// Very nice garden. [break] ...you see this //nim// tree in any other part of the world. It is only in India.

**Indian man:**
Very good.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Very good. [break] [Hindi conversation] Sixty thousand dollars daily.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Every day.

**Prabhupāda:**
Every day. This is preaching, real preaching. Substantial. It will remain. Don't pluck anymore. That's all right.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If they see us, they may stop us coming.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [Hindi] //Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān// [[books:sb:7:6:1|[SB 7.6.1]]]. This is the process. From the very beginning of life. In Hyderabad that garden, Bala, Bala... You have been?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I didn't go on the walk.

**Harikeśa:**
I don't remember the name.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bala Bhavan. Jawahar Bala Bhavan.

**Harikeśa:**
Oh, yes. Bala Bhavan.

**Prabhupāda:**
Three, four big, big buildings, they're closed. What they are teaching to the //bālas?// No teaching. Very old buildings.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is Lodi tomb. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Lodi dynasty, there were family, Lodi dynasty.

**Indian man:**
Yes, Lodi tomb.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tomb worship. [break]

**Indian man:**
All the conferences here are educational.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's built by the Americans?

**Indian man:**
Yes. Behind this is a fruit farmer's lot. [indistinct] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...the tomb? Very big.

**Harikeśa:**
I was just thinking that this was really a case of decoration of the dead body.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, see the Taj Mahal. That's thousand times better than this.

**Prabhupāda:**
[sound of bicycle bell] In the gate it is said that bicycle prohibited. [break] ...tomb was constructed before Taj Mahal. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...improvement on this park.

**Indian man:**
The last two years they have rebuilt this park. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...there are similar buildings.

**Hari-śauri:**
In Rome?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Old. And hundreds of tourists go to see them.

**Hari-śauri:**
That Coliseum is very famous all over the world. That Coliseum?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Indian man:**
[Hindi] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**

> yānti deva-vratā devān
> pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ
> bhūtejyā yānti bhūtāni 
> mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām
> [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]

After this body, one has to go somewhere. So this is the description, who will go where. //Mad-yājino 'pi mām.// Those who are preparing to go back to Godhead, they can go. Otherwise, if you go..., want to go in the higher planetary system or in the lower planetary, that you also go. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We go from here. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...inquires, "Why you are chanting?" The simple reply is that "We have to go somewhere after death. We are going to Godhead. And you do not know where you'll go." //Thik hai?// They do not know where they will go. The animals do not know. Huh?

**Indian man:**
We know where we have to go to [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [end]
