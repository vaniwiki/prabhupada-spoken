**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. Give him initiation. [Hindi about shaving]

**Lokanātha:**
[indistinct] initiation, he should do it first?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Lokanātha:**
I'll ask him.

**Devotee:**
//Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody said to him? You did not know? Let him shave up. Then we shall... You should. You are introducing, you did not know? Then who has introduced?

**Lokanātha:**
Tejiyas.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tejiyas is not saying, and you also not detect? You should be very careful. If you remain ignorant, all ignorant, then where is progress? Everything ignorant I have to find out. So many big, big monkeys, nobody could find out. Big, big monkey, big, big belly. You also did not. That's all... Who is next?

**Pradyumna:**
Anyone else? That is all, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So? [Hindi conversation] [break] Yes. Because some of them, they could not follow Hindi.

**Pradyumna:**
I'll just do it fast. First //nāma-aparādha// is [Sanskrit verse] //Paramam aparādham// The saints, the saintly persons who are spreading the glories of the holy name, if we abuse them, if we make offense at the people who are spreading the glories of the holy name, then the holy name will never tolerate that. How can the holy name tolerate the abuse of those who are spreading the glories of the holy name? So we must understand that a saintly person, a //sādhu, satām,// spreading the glories of Kṛṣṇa, talking about Kṛṣṇa, must never be offended. Must always be very careful. //Sādhu-saṅga// [[books:cc:madhya:22:83|[Cc. Madhya 22.83]]]. You must know how to associate with the //sādhus,// to always honor them and worship them and not to make offense. The second offense is that we should not put the..., understand that the names of Śrī Kṛṣṇa or //Viṣṇu-tattva// personalities, which are completely spiritual, are the same as the material designations of //jīvas// like ourselves. There's //Viṣṇu-tattva,// there is //jīva. Viṣṇu-tattva// is God; //jīva// is this ordinary living entity. The name of the Supreme is the same as the Supreme. The name of the //jīva// is different from the //jīva.// So we should not confuse these. We should understand the name of Viṣṇu is the same as Viṣṇu. The name of //jīva// is not the same. So the names of demigods---the demigods are also //jīvas//---their names are not spiritual. If we call names of some demigods, it will not do us the same spiritual..., it will not give us this spiritual result as calling the name of Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore during the time of initiation we change the name. A spiritual name is given. Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
Because that spiritual name has..., because the name of Kṛṣṇa, a name of Hari, has the spiritual potency; therefore we use the name of Hari as much as possible. Hari dāsa...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dāsa.// Not that name, but the name's servant. //Dāsa.// When one is named Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa dāsa, he is servant of Kṛṣṇa. Not that Kṛṣṇa. If he thinks, "I have become Kṛṣṇa," that is //Māyāvāda.// Kṛṣṇa dāsa. Go on.

**Pradyumna:**
The next offense is //guror avajñā,// to neglect or disrespect the orders of the spiritual master. Because the spiritual master is the external representation of the internal Kṛṣṇa, whatever the spiritual master says is to be taken as exactly what Kṛṣṇa's desire is. Kṛṣṇa is within all of us as Paramātmā, but because we cannot see Him, because He is //adhokṣaja,// or above our senses, therefore that same Kṛṣṇa within appears without as the spiritual master, and he gives us instructions, and these are taken to be the same as Kṛṣṇa's instructions. So to disrespect the orders of the //guru// is not to make any progress on the spiritual path. //Na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.// There can be no //gatiḥ,// there can be no spiritual achievement without following the orders of the spiritual master, because the order of the spiritual master is the same as Kṛṣṇa's order. //Śruti-śāstra-nindanam.// One should not make blasphemy the //śruti,// which are the //Vedas,// and //śāstra,// the //śāstras// which follow the //Vedas.// This is //Mahābhārata,// the //Purāṇas,// the //itihāsa,// the //smṛti. Śruti-smṛti.// These are the two eyes. It is said the //brāhmaṇa// has two eyes: one is //śruti,// one is //smṛti.// So by these //śāstras// we can understand, because the //śāstras// are made by God, because they are emanating from God; therefore they are perfect. As Kṛṣṇa...

**Prabhupāda:**
Not different. Not different from God.

**Pradyumna:**
Because God is perfect, because Kṛṣṇa is perfect, therefore His words and His ideas are also perfect. So these //śāstras// are the words of God. So they are also perfect. So the //śruti-śāstra-nindanam// means to think that there may be something wrong in the scripture or to take one verse out of //Bhagavad-gītā// and reject another verse. Because it is all coming from Kṛṣṇa and is all-perfect, therefore everything is perfect within it. We must accept everything. We must accept it without any..., as being without any fault. So //śruti-śāstra-nindanam.// We should not think that it has any imperfection, that "This may be wrong." //Śruti-śāstra-nindanam hari-nāmni kalpanam.// We should not think that the..., should not speculate on the nature of the holy name.

**Prabhupāda:**
Go on, next. //Nāmnād balād pāpa-buddhiḥ.//

**Pradyumna:**
//Nāmnād balād pāpa-buddhir na tasya śuddhiḥ, na tasya vidyate śuddhir yamaiḥ.// Of one who makes... The next offense is that..., if by chanting the holy name one becomes relieved from all his past sinful reactions, so if one thinks that "I will perform sinful activities. I'll have illicit sex, I'll eat meat, fish..." [break] [end]
