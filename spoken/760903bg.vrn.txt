====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.15, Arrival Address ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So here is a verse, number fifteen, from //Bhagavad-gītā,// Seventh Chapter:

> na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ
> prapadyante narādhamāḥ
> māyayāpahṛta-jñānā
> āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]

So we have made this verse a standard of examination. We haven't got to do anything. Everything is there, because Kṛṣṇa is the original //guru. Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam// [[books:bg:2:7|[Bg. 2.7]]]. Arjuna, in the //paramparā// system, is teaching us how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. So this is the qualification how to advance in spiritual consciousness. People are suffering. For want of spiritual consciousness, they are living like animal, //dehātma-buddhiḥ.//

> yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke
> sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma ijyadhīḥ
> yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij
> janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ
> [SB 10.84.13]

//Go-kharaḥ// means animals---cows and asses. Anyone who is thinking, "I am this body," he is animal. This is the verdict. Actually he is animal. If the dog is thinking, "I am dog," and if some gentleman is thinking, "I am Indian," "I am American," or "I am Englishman," where is the difference? To identify the body? There is no difference.

So on this platform of bodily concept of life, we remain animal. And to raise from that animal platform to the platform of our spiritual consciousness, that is the business of human life. //Athāto brahma jijñāsā.// This is the //Vedānta-sūtra.// If we do not inquire about Brahman in this human form of life, which is obtained after many, many births... //Bahūnāṁ sambhavante.// Many, many millions of years and millions of births. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptir:// we change our body, but because we are on the animal platform, we cannot understand that we have to change our body. So Kṛṣṇa personally comes, because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. //Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. He's more anxious for us, because we are suffering in this material world under bodily concept of life. That is His first instruction, //tathā dehāntara-prāptir.// We have to understand that we have to change this body. Don't be happy because you have got by //karma// a comfortable body. No body is comfortable. It is temporary, even it is comfortable. Even if you have got a very nice body, American body or European body, it may appear to be very nice, better than the Indian body---but that is not permanent. You'll have to change it. That is spiritual consciousness.

So we must be prepared. This is //glānir.// On the platform of bodily concept of life, whatever we are doing, that is all defeat. //Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam// [[books:sb:5:5:5|[SB 5.5.5]]]. In the bodily concept of life, whatever we are doing, simply defeat. We are thinking, "I'm making very good progress." Rascaldom. There is no progress. Unless you become inquisitive, //athāto brahma jijñāsā,// there is no progress. That has been taught by our //ācāryas.// Sanātana Gosvāmī, when he approached..., Sanātana Gosvāmī approached Lord Caitanya, his first question was... He was prime minister, he was a very big man, but he approached Caitanya Mahāprabhu to inquire, "Who am I?" //Ke āmi.// That was his inquiry. //Ke āmi kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya, apani kaha prabhu kiser hita haya// [[books:cc:madhya:20:102|[Cc. Madhya 20.102]]].

So this is the process, to know of oneself, not to be bewildered for the temporary, bodily comforts. This is the instruction of the whole Vedic literature. Prahlāda Mahārāja also said to Lord Nṛsiṁha-deva, //śoce tato vimukha-cetasa māyā-sukhāya bharata vimūḍhān, māyā-sukhāya bhavato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]], that those who are engaged for this temporary //māyā-sukha,// they are //vimūḍhān.// The same thing is explained here: //na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. So those who are after this material happiness, they have been always described in all //śāstras,// and Kṛṣṇa is personally describing: //mūḍha. Vimūḍhān.// If we want to remain a //vimūḍhān// and suffer this material existence, that is our not very sign of good intelligence. Everyone should try to be intelligent enough what is the goal of life, what is to be done in this human form of life.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the supreme welfare activities in the world, because we are trying to stop the life of hogs and dogs. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Viḍ-bhujām,// the stool-eaters, hogs, what is their business? We have seen in Vṛndāvana also there are many hogs---day and night searching after stool, and eating, and getting some strength and fat, then sense enjoyment, never mind whether it is mother, sister or daughter. This hogs' and dogs' life should be stopped. It is not possible for everyone to stop, but those who are intelligent, fortunate, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu said,

> ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgyavān jīva,
> guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpā pāya bhakti-latā-bīja
> [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]

So you are all fortunate that you have taken to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, //bhakti-latā-bīja.// And proceed according to the principles. And the first principle is //tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. This is the first principle. //Ādau gurvāśrayam.// That is the first principle. And in the //Vedas// also it is said that,

> yasya deve parā bhaktir
> yathā deve tathā gurau
> tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ
> prakāśante...
> [ŚU 6.23]

Vedic knowledge is revelation. Vedic knowledge is not understood by so-called mundane scholarship, by reading grammar. No. Vedic knowledge is possible to be understood by a person who has got unflinching faith in the bona fide //guru. Guru// means representative of Kṛṣṇa---Kṛṣṇa and His representative. We have repeatedly discussed this fact that //guru// means the bona fide servant of Kṛṣṇa. //Guru// does not mean a magician or jugglery. That is not //guru. Guru// means... It is explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu very easily how to become //guru.// He has asked everyone, especially those who are born in India, //bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra// [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]. Especially. Because we Indians, //bhāratīya,// we have got facilities to become //guru// of the whole world. We have got the facility. Because here we have got the literatures, Vedic literatures, especially the //Bhagavad-gītā,// which is spoken by Kṛṣṇa Himself. If we try to understand what is the aim of life and preach all over the world, then you become //guru.// And if we want to cheat others in the name of so-called //yogīs, svāmī,// scholar, that will not make you //guru. Guru...// Caitanya Mahāprabhu says you become, all Indians, all //bhāratīyas, guru. Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. Wherever you are. And how shall I become //guru? Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa upadeśa.// That's all.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to follow the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction is this, to preach //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.// And this is //kṛṣṇa upadeśa: na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ// [[books:bg:7:15|[Bg. 7.15]]]. This is not our manufactured words; it is //kṛṣṇa-upadeśa,// that "Anyone who is not surrendered to Me, //duṣkṛtina,// he is immediately classified into four groups." What are they? //Duṣkṛtina, mūḍhāḥ, narādhamāḥ, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā, āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.// So it is a very simple thing. Who is a //mūḍha?// If one does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa, if one does not understand what Kṛṣṇa, he is either //duṣkṛtina,// means sinful; //mūḍha,// rascal; //narādhama,// lowest of the mankind; and //māyayāpahṛta-jñānā,// and his so-called education and degrees are useless because real knowledge is taken away from him. //Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.// So there is no need of fighting by... But we can understand what are these people in general. They are within these four groups of men.

So we have to face them. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is facing these rascals, these //duṣkṛtina,// these //narādhamas,// and to request them to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. You cannot sit idly to show your gorgeousness in a secluded place, imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. No. You have to preach. That is the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. //Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. That is really following the Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Not to imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura. That is not possible. You can... Even you do that very nicely, that is for your safety. Supposing that you are doing nicely, but that is for your safety. But one who is facing dangerous position for others' benefit, they are very quickly recognized by Kṛṣṇa.

> na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu
> kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ
> [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]

> ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ
> mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati
> [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]

So if you face... Just like fighting soldiers, they are facing danger for the country. They are recognized. Similarly, those who are preachers---on behalf of Kṛṣṇa preaching people to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness---they are great soldiers.

So I am very happy that you Europeans and Americans, especially, you are helping me. So continue this process, and that is the very easy way to be recognized by Kṛṣṇa. Because He says, //na ca tasman manusyesu kaścin me priya-krttamaḥ// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. Who? Who is preaching this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So I thank you very much that you have come here in Vṛndāvana, and you are traveling, you are preaching. So let us dedicate this life for preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. Never mind we die by preaching. Still, it will be glorious.

Thank you very much.
