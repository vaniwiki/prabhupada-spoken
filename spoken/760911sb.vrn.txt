====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.7.12 ======

**Pradyumna:** Translation: "Sūta Gosvāmī thus addressed the //ṛṣis// headed by Śaunaka: Now I shall begin the transcendental narration of the Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa and topics of the birth, activities and deliverance of King Parīkṣit, the sage amongst kings, as well as topics of the renunciation of the worldly order by the sons of Pāṇḍu."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [aside:] The flies are disturbing. How we are...

> parīkṣito 'tha rājarṣer
> janma-karma-vilāpanam

This //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// is another //Purāṇa,// history. We have already explained. So sometimes a class of devotees known as //sahajiyā,// they say that "What we have got to do with the narration of Kurukṣetra battle?" They immediately jump to the //kṛṣṇa-līlā,// directly with the //gopīs.// And Kṛṣṇa's activities in other field, they think it is useless. But that is not the fact. Anywhere Kṛṣṇa is acting, that is transcendental. The battlefield of Kurukṣetra, historical references, description, so superficially it appears that what a devotee has got to do with this battlefield? But battlefield or no battlefield, wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, that is transcendental. This has to be understood. Otherwise, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, why he should indulge in describing how Uttarā's pregnancy was saved by Kṛṣṇa, how the //brahmāstra// was thrown by Aśvatthāmā? So Śukadeva Gosvāmī is liberated person. Why he should indulge in these material things? No. Those who are advanced, they know that Kṛṣṇa's dancing with the //gopīs,// that //līlā// and Kṛṣṇa's playing as the leader of the battlefield of Kurukṣetra, is the same. It is all transcendental. One should not make any distinction between the two. //Saṁsthāṁ ca pāṇḍu-putrāṇāṁ vakṣye kṛṣṇa-kathodayam. Pāṇḍu-putrāṇām,// the //pāṇḍu-putras,// or the Pāṇḍavas, son of Pāṇḍu, they're all devotees. Even their political affairs, because there is connection with Kṛṣṇa, it is //kṛṣṇa-kathā.// Those who are with poor fund of knowledge...

[break] ...directly taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa or to take shelter of a pure devotee who is under the shelter of Kṛṣṇa. //Mad-āśrayaḥ.// So if one takes shelter of a pure devotee... Just like electricity: the powerhouse is far away, but the power is coming. Suppose your body is electrified, and if I touch, then my body immediately becomes electrified. And if somebody touches me, then other's body. This is electric. Similarly, one who is pure devotee, he's authorized by Kṛṣṇa, he's electrified. So if one takes shelter of a pure devotee, then he becomes purified. //Yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ śudhyanti// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. That is the statement given by Śukadeva Gosvāmī. How the //caṇḍālas// can become purified? The example I have already stated. Then at the end, Śukadeva Gosvāmī says, //prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// This is the supreme transcendental power of Viṣṇu. He can do. Sometimes they say that unless the body is changed, how a //caṇḍāla// can become purified? Yes, body is changing. Because we do not know how the body is changing... Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ. Dehāntara-prāptiḥ. Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā tathā// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]], like that. //Tathā// means "like that." //Dehāntara-prāptiḥ.// So these are //dehāntara. Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.// This is //dehāntara.// Every moment we are changing our body. This is //dehāntara.// Kṛṣṇa says, the greatest authority. How you can say that there is no //dehāntara?// Yes, //dehāntara.// Suppose in my childhood I am born in a //caṇḍāla// family, but if by initiation, by taking shelter of a pure devotee, I become initiated, so //dehāntara// is there, going on. So if I take initiation seriously, so in the next //dehāntara...// Suppose yesterday I was a //caṇḍāla.// Now by this time there is //dehāntara,// and if I am purified by initiation... So this argument... //Dehāntara// is already there. Scientifically, in modern understanding, and on the authority of Kṛṣṇa's statement, //dehāntara// is going on. Not that somebody was European or... We take Europeans as //mlecchas, yavanas.// Yes, he was yesterday //mleccha// and //yavanas,// but he has changed his body, and after changing, if he's initiated, then //dehāntara. Śudhyanti,// he's purified. //Śudhyanti.//

So how this is possible, if we cannot understand... Because Lord Viṣṇu's energy is inconceivable. Inconceivable, //acintya.// Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī has discussed. Unless you accept //acintya-śakti// of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, you cannot understand. You have to accept. It is //acintya,// inconceivable, by us. But it is not inconceivable by the advanced devotees. Or anything being executed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is not inconceivable by Him. //Svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8, //Cc. Madhya 13.65,// purport]. He's so perfect in knowledge that what we are thinking inconceivable, that is very, very easily done with full knowledge by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So what is inconceivable by us, it is not inconceivable by Him.

Therefore we have to learn it from,

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

We cannot understand directly. It is not possible. So we have to approach //tattva-darśī.// Just like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, //tattva-darśī.// He says //śudhyanti.// Yes, he's purified, although he is born of //kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśāḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]], //caṇḍāla. Caṇḍālo 'pi dvija-śreṣṭho hari-bhakti-parāyaṇaḥ.// So it is inconceivable by us how a //caṇḍāla// can be //dvija-śreṣṭha,// more than a //brāhmaṇa.// It is inconceivable by me. But when we get a statement of the authorities like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, and above that, Kṛṣṇa... Because the conclusion of Kṛṣṇa and the conclusion of pure devotee like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, they are the same. Just see here. Kṛṣṇa says, //māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]]. So unless one is purified, how he can go to //parāṁ gatim?// And Śukadeva Gosvāmī also says the same thing. //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra. Pāpa-yoni.// They are //pāpa-yoni. Śudhyanti prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// Simply we have to go through the process; otherwise everything is possible. That is the omnipotency of Kṛṣṇa.

We use this word "omnipotency," but we do not know actually what is that omnipotency. Omnipotency means He has got diverse energies. That is omnipotency. And we do not know by which energy He's acting in a particular case. But this is a fact, that His energy is working. And He says also in the //Bhagavad-gītā// directly, //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa,// "Under My supervision //prakṛti// is acting." So how //prakṛti// is directed, how Kṛṣṇa is directing //prakṛti// to make a nice flower... Just like here, they're painting flower on the wall. It takes so much time, so much arrangement. Still, it is not as good as a natural flower. Here you have painted one rose flower, and here are roses. There is art also, and here is art also. Without art, without artistic sense, how this nice thing, beautiful thing, can come in? You'll find a beautiful flower bloom in a plant, you appreciate it. And don't think, as the rascal says, "By nature it has come automatically." No. The same energy as you are taking---you are applying your energy to paint a flower on the wall with your paints and brushes---but Kṛṣṇa is also doing that, but His energy is so inconceivable that we cannot see how He's working. But He's working. Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa says, //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]: "//Prakṛti// is working under My direction"? Is it a bluff? No. Actually, //prakṛti// is acting under His direction.

It is confirmed in the //Brahma-saṁhitā,//

> sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā
> chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni bibharti durgā
> icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā...
> [Bs. 5.44]

So //prakṛti. Icchānurūpam api yasya.// That //prakṛti,// Durgā, is acting under the direction of Govinda. //Icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi.// The direction is there. Direction is there actually. But because we cannot conceive how in this plan the direction of the Supreme Lord is there so that a nice flower is coming with so beautiful feature... But direction is there, we should know. In ordinarily we say sometimes that "Not a blade of grass moves without the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead." So everything is going on under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Don't think that it is taking automatically. There is no such thing as automatic. But the direction is so quick, so sufficient and so perfect. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. Automatically, immediately. There are so many machines we have, just like the computer. There is machine working, but it is so minute that simply by pushing one button, so many things immediately done. This is a material machine, manufactured by a human being. And how much perfect the machine of Kṛṣṇa will be, just imagine.

So this material nature is nothing but machine. It is not God. Those who are with poor fund of knowledge, they are taking directly this material nature as working. No. Material nature has no power to act. It is dull. The same example, the computer. It is a very nice machine, but it cannot work automatically unless an expert pushes the button. So material nature cannot do anything. It is Kṛṣṇa's direction. So in everywhere there is Kṛṣṇa's direction. One who has got the eyes to see, for him, //kṛṣṇa-kathodayam.// Whatever he sees, he remembers Kṛṣṇa.

> sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhe nā dekhe tāra mūrti
> sarvatra haya nija iṣṭa-deva-sphūrti
> [[books:cc:madhya:8:274|[Cc. Madhya 8.274]]]

One has to become advanced devotee to understand how Kṛṣṇa's direction is going on. They can understand. Don't think that things are taking place automatically. Therefore even in adverse condition a devotee does not see that "This thing is happening without direction of Kṛṣṇa." Even if he is in an adverse condition, he does not feel any pain, because he knows that "This adverse condition is also under the direction of Kṛṣṇa. So I am fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. Why I shall take this adverse position as not mercy of Kṛṣṇa? It is also mercy of Kṛṣṇa." //Tat te 'nukampāṁ su-samīkṣamāṇo bhuñjāna evātma-kṛtaṁ vipākam// [SB 10.14.8]. A devotee is not disturbed by adverse condition. He takes that this is a gift of Kṛṣṇa. //Tat te anukampām.// "It is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Although I am put into difficulty, it is Kṛṣṇa's mercy."

So anyone who takes in that way, //mukti-pade sa daya-bhāk:// his going back to home, back to Godhead, is guaranteed. Because he takes everything as Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. Prahlāda Mahārāja was so much chastised by his father. You know how he was put into difficulty in so many ways. But he was taking, "This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy." He did not take otherwise. So in this way, wherever... Everywhere there is Kṛṣṇa's hand, so what to speak of this battlefield or any other thing. So we should not take otherwise, that "This the best part and this is the lowest part." No. Wherever there is Kṛṣṇa directly. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere, but we cannot see. But at least in //Mahābhārata,// in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in Kṛṣṇa's dealing with the Pāṇḍavas, the Kṛṣṇa's hand is there. That is Kṛṣṇa's //līlā.// [break] ...it is not like that. One who is advanced, one who is actually in knowledge, they will take //kṛṣṇa-kathodayam.// Wherever Kṛṣṇa's //kathā// is there, it is as good as any other. That is the way of...

Thank you very much.
