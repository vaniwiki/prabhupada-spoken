====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.7.20–21 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [chants verse]

> athopaspṛśya salilaṁ
> sandadhe tat samāhitaḥ
> ajānann api saṁhāraṁ
> prāṇa-kṛcchra upasthite
> [[books:sb:1:7:20|[SB 1.7.20]]]

Translation: [03:21] "Since his life was in danger, he touched water in sanctity and concentrated upon the chanting of the hymns for throwing nuclear weapons, although he did not know how to withdraw such weapons."

> tataḥ prāduṣkṛtaṁ tejaḥ
> pracaṇḍaṁ sarvato diśam
> prāṇāpadam abhiprekṣya
> viṣṇuṁ jiṣṇur uvāca ha
> [[books:sb:1:7:21|[SB 1.7.21]]]

Translation: [04:17] "Therefore a glaring light spread in all directions. It was so fierce that Arjuna thought his own life in danger, and so he began to address Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa."

**Prabhupāda:**

> athopaspṛśya salilaṁ
> sandadhe tat samāhitaḥ
> ajānann api saṁhāraṁ
> prāṇa-kṛcchra upasthite
> [[books:sb:1:7:20|[SB 1.7.20]]]

> tataḥ prāduṣkṛtaṁ tejaḥ
> pracaṇḍaṁ sarvato diśam

So necessity has no law. This //brahma-bandhu,// he knew how to create this //brahmāstra.// He learnt it. But he knew it also that this weapon is not to be used generally. In very, very rare cases this should be used. As I explained, that atomic bomb, the nuclear weapon, is not used when there is fight between two dogs. It is not so insignificant. When the fight is very severe... Just like your country used this nuclear bomb. When the Japanese people dared to attack your Pearl Harbor, at that time, your president was Mr. Truman. So it was not to be used, but he took little more precaution. Anyway, such weapon, deadly weapon, should not be used ordinarily. Therefore here it is said that //prāṇa-kṛcchra upasthite.// He knew that Arjuna was after him and there is no escape. He would be killed. So whatever last resort he knew, he used that knowledge to throw //brahmāstra// so that the other party may be killed altogether. But //ajānann api saṁhāram.// He was not willing, but he did not know how to withdraw that. Formerly, they used to know it. They could throw one //brahmāstra,// and if he likes he can withdraw, or the other party, he can nullify it. This is warfare. But he did not know that. How to counteract it, he did not know that.

Another point is here. //Athopaspṛśya salilam:// this //mantra// weapon is so strong that it can be manufactured simply by touching water with //mantra.// Just like we take //mantra,// Sanskrit, //apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ sa bāhya// [Garuḍa Purāṇa]. The same process. Do not think that it is some ritualistic external. No. It has got meaning. If you can chant the //mantra// properly, if you follow the rules and... You must be expert in chanting //mantra.// Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// we are chanting, and Haridāsa Ṭhākura is also chanting. So Haridāsa Ṭhākura, how advanced he was, just imagine. He was a young man, and a very nice, beautiful prostitute came there at dead of night, wanted to enjoy his company, and he said simply, "Very good idea. Please sit down. Let me finish my Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.//" Is it possible for ordinary man? No. It is not possible. That means he was expert, he was advanced. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has advised, //ihā haite sarva-siddhi haibe tomāra// [//Caitanya-bhāgavata Madhya// 23.78].

Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said, "Simply by chanting you'll get all success of life." //Sarva-siddhi.// It is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's blessing. //Ihā haite sarva-siddhi haibe tomāra.// By simply chanting one gets the highest perfection. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's blessing and gift. So we should be very careful and follow the regulative principles. Then automatically you'll be perfect. There is no doubt about it. //Mantra...// Just like sometimes the snake-charming //mantra// can be purchased in the market. But if you do not make yourself perfect about chanting the //mantra,// it will not be effective.

I'll give you one practical instance. It is not a story; it is a fact. It was spoken... Perhaps some of you know that my friend who came here, Dr. Ghosh. He told me when they were students, there was a case. In Lucknow University they were students. So there is a big building, and two, three snake-biting case happened. So some snake charmer was invited to find out the snake and take him. So he came. He came and took it away, the snake. Then this Dr. Gosh and his class friends, they were medical students. Naturally, the so-called modern scientist, they do not believe in all these things. So they became very inquisitive. All of them went to that snake charmer---he was a Muhammadan gentleman. So he knew that "These students, medical students, they have come to see the fun, how the snakes are charmed." So he [they] inquired, "What is the matter? What is the magic that you can catch up snake and the snake cannot do any harm to you?" So he said it is possible by //mantra.// By //mantra// it can be done. So they challenged, "Oh, your snakes, I think they are poisonless and they cannot bite. There is no poison. The poison teeth, the fang, is taken away." "No, no. They have got everything." So he took one and showed that "Here is..." So to make a fun... He had many snakes. He let them all come out from the box. And immediately all over the courtyard, just like courtyard, they began to run over, and all these medical students, they became afraid. They were fleeing this side, that side, that side. So the charmer said, "Don't be afraid. So long I am here they'll not bite you."

So this was spoken by Dr. Ghosh, a personal experience. The //mantra// has got so much power. But not that you purchase the //mantra// and chant. That will not. You have to make it perfect. There is process, how to become perfect in chanting the //mantra.// Similarly... It is an ordinary, material //mantra.// This spiritual //mantra...// I have already explained, this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is spiritual //mantra.// It is not material. Therefore, I've already explained, //golokera prema-dhana hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.// It is not ordinary sound vibration, material sound vibration, radio. No. Spiritual. //Golokera prema-dhana.// So if we actually chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// properly, without any offense, then once chanting is sufficient to make you free from the reaction of all sinful life. Once chanted. There is no question of chanting thousand times. It is said, //eka hari-nāme jato pāpa hare, pāpī haya tato pāpa karibāre nare.// Once chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// can vanquish so many..., so much accumulated reaction of sinful life that a first-class //pāpī// or a very expert //pāpī,// he cannot commit so many //pāpa.// You see. It is so powerful. So if we chant it properly, this chanting, //daśa-vidha,// ten offenses, without offenses... //Nāma-aparādha-śūnyam.// Without any //nāma-aparādha,// if we chant according to the principle, then the //mantra// will act. //Mantra// will act in so nicely that the //mantra// will keep you always in touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is the power of //mantra.// Don't think it is a hobby or it is something superfluous. No. Actually, this //mantra,// Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa---Kṛṣṇa Himself.

So if you are allowed to keep yourself constantly in company with Kṛṣṇa, then just imagine what is your position. If you keep yourself always near the fire, certainly you shall remain warm; there will be no attack of cold or anything like that. So if we constantly chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// then we are not in this material world. But if we purposely again come to the material world... That independence we have got. But if we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// according to the instructions... //Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.// We have to practice. Because Gosvāmīs, they kept a number, a numerical strength. Haridāsa Ṭhākura kept the biggest. Others, they also kept, but not so big. But according... Because, just like Rūpa Gosvāmī, he had to write so many books, so he was not keeping such a big number as three //lakhs.// But there was some numerical... Similarly, we must have some numerical strength. And we have minimized. I know that you are coming from a different source, so according to time, according to circumstances... Even there, there is no limit. You can chant more than sixteen---sixteen hundred times. There is no... But practically we see that even chanting sixteen rounds becomes difficult. So don't try to imitate, but do it properly, what is advised by your spiritual master, without any offense. That //mantra// will save you from the dangers of //māyā.// That's a fact.

You see he manufactured this deadly weapon. It is material. Still, it is so deadly weapon, //brahmāstra.// He was not working in a laboratory, finding out so many chemicals to make an atomic nuclear weapon. Simply water. You see. Here it is said, //atha upaspṛśya salilam.// Just like we do, //oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi.// Then if we do it properly, then it has got immense potency. Immense potency. Don't think it is childish, it is formality. No. Just see here. //Atha upaspṛśya salilaṁ sandadhe tat samāhitaḥ.// This is wanted. //Samāhita,// completely in trance. This is the process. So these things are required, how to become //samāhita, samādhi-stha,// in trance. If we take it as childish play, formality, then it will act, but it will take long time. But if you do it properly, you'll be quickly successful. In one life you'll be successful. You don't require to wait. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that although this process is guaranteed, but don't wait for another life. Finish this business in this life. It is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā// even though one falls immaturely, then //yoga-bhraṣṭo..., śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sanjāyate// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. One who has not been successful, one is fallen from this //bhakti-yoga,// for him also there is guarantee nice. That guarantee, Kṛṣṇa says that //śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sanjāyate. Śucīnām.// Then he's given the chance of taking birth in a very pious //brāhmaṇa's// family. Not ordinary: //śucīnām. Śuci// means //brāhmaṇa,// and //śrīmatā, śrī// means fortune, and //mat// means one possesses fortune---that means very rich man. //Śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sanjāyate.// Even...

Therefore Nārada Muni has said in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,//

> tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer
> bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi
> ko va vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ...
> [[books:sb:1:5:17|[SB 1.5.17]]]

This verse is very important. He says that if one takes sentimentally this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, //tyaktvā sva-dharmam...// Just like in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, you young men, young boys and girls, are coming. You had some engagement previously, undoubtedly. You may be you were a student, you may be businessman or so on, so on. Everyone has got... At least you had some business for LSD. So you have given up all this. //Tyaktvā sva-dharmam.// Somehow or other you were all engaged in some business. That is called //sva-dharma. Sva-dharma// means one has selected some business. That is his //sva-dharma.// Generally, if it is systematic, then //sva-dharma// means //brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.// This is systematic, //sva-dharma.// Otherwise, everyone must have some engagement. Suppose a thief, he has taken the occupation, or profession, of stealing. That is also //sva-dharma.// But that is not systematic; that is whimsical. So anyone must have some engagement. That engagement is called //sva-dharma,// his own business occupation. //Sva-karma// or //sva-dharma.//

So if by chance somebody becomes attracted by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and gives up his profession, good profession or bad profession... There is no good profession in this material world. Everything is bad. That is... Here we have divided, "This is good, this is bad." This is mental concoction. It has no value, because material world is bad. I have given this example many times: just like stool, the upside and downside. Downside is moist and upside is dry. If somebody says, "This side is very nice," what is this nonsense? It is stool. Why do you forget that the dry side is good and moist side is bad, but it is stool, this side or that side? Similarly, //Caitanya-caritāmṛta kaj,// Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī, has said,

> 'dvaite' bhadrābhadra-jñāna, saba---'manodharma'
> 'ei bhāla, ei manda'---ei saba 'bhrama'
> [Caitanya-caritāmṛta Antya 4.176]

//Dvaite...// In the material world, //dvaite bhadrābhadra,// "This is good, this is bad," it is all mental concoction. After all, it is material world. Either you become very expert in handling these material affairs, very big businessman, Mr. Ford, Mr. this and that, or so many things... [break] ...successful, what is the meaning of this "successful," "unsuccessful"? You have to die. You have to suffer from disease. Just like nowadays the flu is going on. Does it mean that a big man or a rich man will not suffer? When the disease is there, either you are big man or rich man or poor man or small man, everyone has to suffer. So long you will be in the material world, if you do not rectify yourself, //śuddha-sattva... Tapo divyaṁ yena śuddhyet sattvam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. If you don't rectify your existence, then this //janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi// will go on [[books:bg:13:8-12|[Bg. 13.9]]]. Then what is the good? Actually, there is no good. //'Ei bhāla, ei manda'---ei saba 'bhrama'.// It is simply mental concoction. So in the material world, even you become very expert to deal with your business very nicely, it is all useless. //Ko vārtha āpto 'bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ.// If one does not become Kṛṣṇa conscious, his so-called success in this material world or failure, they have no value. Rather, if by sentiment somebody comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and if for a few days he chants Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// their success, in future at least, guaranteed.

So it is so nice thing. If you neglectfully chant, still there is success, but it will take some time. And if you chant very carefully, following the rules and regulations, then your success in this life is guaranteed. So we can make our choice, because always Kṛṣṇa gives us the chance to make our choice. //Yathecchasi tathā kuru// [[books:bg:18:63|[Bg. 18.63]]]: "Whatever you like, you can do." So my request... It is my duty, because you have accepted me as your spiritual master. So I am repeating my spiritual master's order, that "Don't wait for another life." That is a very risky, another life. Maybe I am given the chance of taking my birth in a good //brāhmaṇa// family or a rich family, but there is chance of again being spoiled. As we see, there are so many rich men's sons. They have got all the opportunity of chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. They have no economic problem. Father's property, immense property he has got. So he can..., he has no anxiety for economic problems. That is a chance. To take birth in a rich family means he has no economic problem. Because for economic problem we see nowadays people are pulling on //ṭhelā,// a ricksha, for two breads.[?] Because he is condemned to take such life, to work like an ass, like an animal. We see, practically.

So one who is born in rich family, he should think that Kṛṣṇa... But he has no knowledge, he has no good advisor, he has no //guru.// So he is..., he thinks that "I have got this money for nothing. Let me enjoy wine and women. Let me..." He becomes spoiled. So although he was given the chance, //śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]], //janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]]... Although he was given the chance by nature's law, he spoils himself. Just like in America---I always say that you are born in a rich nation's family. Your country is not poor; there is no scarcity. But you should take advantage of it. Don't spoil your life because you have got so much money for nothing or every enjoyable thing. You should always think, "It is all Kṛṣṇa's mercy that we have got this opportunity. We are honored as Americans." Now because the Americans, they have misused their opportunity, now they are degrading. To save your country, take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and enlighten them. Enlighten them. That is your service, actually service of the country. Push this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They have got good opportunity. And it will be very successful, materially and spiritually.

Thank you very much.
