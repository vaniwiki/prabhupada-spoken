**Pradyumna:**

Translation: "O Lord of lords, how is it that this dangerous effulgence is spreading all around? Where does it come from? I do not understand it."

**Prabhupāda:**

So Aśvatthāmā's //brahmāstra...// We have discussed about //brahmāstra.// It is almost similar to the modern nuclear weapon or bomb, but it is made with chemicals, but this //brahmāstra// is made of //mantra.// That is the subtle way. Modern science has not reached to that point of subtle existence. Therefore they cannot understand how transmigration of the soul takes place. The modern science has no knowledge. Imperfect knowledge. They see the gross body, but they have no knowledge about the subtle body. But the subtle body is there. Just like we do not see your mind, but I know that you have got mind. You do not see my mind, but you know that I have got mind. Mind, intelligence and ego. My conception, identity, "I am," that conception is there. That is ego. And my intelligence and my mind, you cannot see, neither I can see. Therefore how the mind, intelligence and personal identity, or egotism, carries the soul to other body, they do not see it. They cannot see it. They see the gross body is stopped, everything is stopped. The gross body is burned into ashes; therefore they think everything is finished. //Bhasmī-bhūtasya dehasya kutaḥ punar āgamano bhaved// [Cārvāka Muni]. The atheist class, they'll think like that. With poor fund of knowledge, they think that "I see the body is now burnt into ashes. Then where is the soul?" So "There is no soul, there is no God, it is all imagination." But that is not the fact; not that is the fact. The fact is that the gross body is finished, but the subtle body is there. //Mano buddhir ahaṅkāraḥ. Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām.// So the action and reaction of the subtle thing, subtle matter... Mind is also matter, but subtle matter, very fine. Just like sky, ether. Ether is also matter, but it is very subtle, fine. And finer than the ether is the mind, and the finer than the mind is the intelligence. And finer than the intelligence is my egotism: "I am," this conception.

So they have no knowledge. Therefore they can manufacture weapon or bomb with the gross things. //Bhūmir āpo 'nalo//---the chemicals, that is gross. But this //brahmāstra// is not gross. This is also material, but it is made of subtle things: mind, intelligence and ego. Therefore Arjuna is asking Kṛṣṇa, "I do not know wherefrom it is coming, wherefrom this such high temperature is coming." It is stated here, //tejaḥ parama-dāruṇam.// The temperature is so high, intolerable. So we should ask the authority. Kṛṣṇa is the best authority. So Arjuna is asking from Him, //kim idaṁ svit kuto veti:// "My dear Kṛṣṇa, wherefrom this temperature is coming?" //Kim idam. Deva-deva.// Why he's asking to Kṛṣṇa? Because Kṛṣṇa is the //deva-deva.// Here we have got many millions of different varieties of life, 8,400,000 varieties of life. Out of them, we human form of life, and above this, the demigods in the higher planetary system, their standard of living, their duration of life is many, many times higher, superior than ours. Just like our standard of life---we are human being---it is better than the uncivilized man. And the uncivilized man's standard of life is better than the animal life. //Nunam mahatāṁ tatra jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.// The uncivilized man, they cannot produce food; therefore they kill animal. In the forest they live, and they kill some animals and eat. They cannot... They have no such knowledge that the forest can be cleared and we can till the ground, and we can get very nice foodstuff, foodgrains, vegetable, so many things. //Kṛṣi,// agriculture. So the land is there, but this uncivilized man does not know how to get the necessities of life from land. They do not know. Otherwise, in the land everything is there. It is stated in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sarva-dughā mahī. Sarva-dughā.// No. //Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī. Kāma. Kāma// means the necessities. We can get all the necessities of our life from the land. The land is so important. But the uncivilized man, they do not know how to utilize the land. Therefore they commit sinful activities for their existence. Instead of utilizing land for the necessities of life, unnecessarily... Although they are civilized---they should not have done so---they are killing animals.

The animal-killing is for the uncivilized man, one who cannot get the necessities of life by intelligence. Just like modern civilized man, they are getting, suppose, so many machines, say motorcar, a very useful vehicle. But wherefrom it is obtained? From the land. What is the motorcar ingredients? It is a combination of matter: earth, water, air, fire. You get iron, put into the fire and melt it, and then get the wheel. Similarly, so many things. //Tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ vinimayaḥ.// Material civilization means //tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ vinimayaḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]---exchange of fire, water and earth---that's all. It is just like you see nice doll. What is this nice doll? //Tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ vinimayaḥ.// There is earth, water, fire. You mix the earth with water and make it a nice doll, and put it into the fire and then color it. It will appear just like a very, very beautiful girl. But it is not the fact. Similarly, the whole material world is nothing but an imitation of the spiritual world by intermixture of earth, water and fire---and nothing else.

But because we are not beyond this material existence; we are in the material... I am identifying with this body, therefore I am thinking that after the finish of this body everything is finished. This is rascaldom, atheism. No. But Kṛṣṇa gives information, //na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre// [[books:bg:2:20|[Bg. 2.20]]]. This is right information. Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority, gives you the information that "Don't think that this body is finished, therefore everything is finished. No. Not everything finished. The soul is being carried by the subtle body." The example is given just like when the air passes through the rose garden and you smell very nice fragrance. You cannot see what is that fragrance, but you experience that there is some fragrance. Wherefrom? Sometimes we inquire, "Wherefrom this fragrance coming?" You cannot see. Similarly, the soul is very, very small, a small particle of the same ingredient as Kṛṣṇa. //Mamaivāṁśa. Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. //Jīva// is very small particle of the same ingredient as Kṛṣṇa's body. //Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. So we have got our //vigraha,// very small. That is also stated in the //śāstra. Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya ca// [[books:cc:madhya:19:140|[Cc. Madhya 19.140]]]: one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair. We cannot even imagine what is the length and breadth of the hair, but the soul is one ten-thousandth part. So how you can see the soul? That small particle is being carried by the subtle body---mind, intelligence and ego. And it is pushed through the semina of the father into the womb of the mother, and another body is manufactured in due course of time, and it comes out and works.

This is called transmigration of the soul---from one body to another. That body is given by superior examination, Yamarāja. Yamarāja fixes up what kind of body this soul will get. //Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa// [[books:sb:3:31:1|[SB 3.31.1]]]. Just like in the court, there is case, and the magistrate decides what kind of punishment this criminal should be awarded. So similarly, here in this material world, we are simply engaged in sinful activities. Here the so-called pious and impious, that is simply imagination. Really, if I am actually pious, I should not get this material body. Just like to remain in the prison house means criminal. You may be a first-class prisoner, it doesn't matter, but you are a prisoner, you are a criminal. Sometimes the big, big politicians, they are put into the jail and they're given all comforts. But that does not mean he's not a criminal. He's a criminal. Either he may be Gandhi or anyone; because he's put into the jail, he's a criminal. Similarly, anyone who is enwrapped with this material body, he's a criminal. He's a criminal. Either he may be in the heavenly planet or in this earthly planet or in the cats' and dogs' life or insect or aquatics. There are varieties of life. Every one of us, as long as we are put into this material body, it is to be understood that we are all criminal.

Therefore Kṛṣṇa said,

> yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ
> janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām
> te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā
> bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ
> [[books:bg:7:28|[Bg. 7.28]]]

The //kṛṣṇa-bhajana// is not so easy thing. //Yeṣāṁ tu anta-gataṁ pāpam.// One who is completely free from the reaction of //pāpa,// he cannot [can] take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But in the ordinary way, //karma...// According to //karma...// Just like you are working to earn some money, businessman, //karma.// So ordinary way you have to work very hard day and night to get some money. Suppose if you want one //lakh// of rupees or one //crore// of rupees, you have to work for it. But there is another way. Suppose one rich man gives you that "You haven't got to work. Take this one //lakh// of rupees or one //crore// of rupees. You take it." That is another way. Ordinary way to accumulate //crores// of rupees, it may not be possible in your life. But if some friend or some rich man becomes kind upon you and delivers you, "Take it," you can get it immediately, without any hard labor. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa, the supreme rich man, supreme rich being, is offering you, //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām...// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]: "You haven't got to do anything. Come on. You surrender unto Me, and I give you immediately liberation." //Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ.// There is no anxiety.

So that is Kṛṣṇa. He can give you immediately liberation. Simply you have to surrender. Therefore He's //deva-deva.// Sometimes we go to this demigod, to that demigod for some material perfection or ultimate liberation. But Kṛṣṇa can give you liberation within a second. That is Kṛṣṇa. Within a second. Otherwise, it is not very easy. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ// [[books:sb:10:2:32|[SB 10.2.32]]]. The //jñānīs,// they are trying for liberation and undergoing very severe type of austerity and penances. //Kṛcchreṇa. Kṛcchreṇa// means very severe type of austerities they undergo. But still they fall down. //Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ.// One who does not understand Kṛṣṇa, then his knowledge, his so-called //jñāna...// Maybe to some extent it is perfect, but it is not completely perfect. Completely perfect will be possible when you understand Kṛṣṇa.

So if you go on the ordinary way, from the //karma// platform to //jñāna// platform, from //jñāna// platform to //yoga// platform, but ultimately you have to come to the //bhakti// platform. If you do not come to the //bhakti// platform, then there is no question of liberation. That is not possible. You can get better position by //karma, jñāna, yoga.// Suppose a //yogī,// he can achieve many wonderful things. Suppose we can fly in the sky by airplane. Many hundreds of miles we can. But a //yogī,// within a second he can reach even the sun planet. That yogic perfection is there. //Prāpti-siddhi.// It is called //prāpti-siddhi.// A perfect //yogī,// simply by catching the beam of sunlight, he can go to the sun planet, he can go to the moon planet, within a second. That is called //yoga-siddhi.// But even if you go to the sun planet or moon planet by //yoga-siddhi// or material science, what is the profit? There is no profit. Kṛṣṇa says, //ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna// [[books:bg:8:16|[Bg. 8.16]]]: "Even if you approach the topmost planet, Brahmaloka, you have to come back again." Again come back, again become grass, and again be eaten by cows, and again somebody drinks milk, and he gets the semina, again gives you birth in the womb of woman. These subtle laws they do not know, how things are happening in the subtle ways.

Therefore Arjuna knows, but for our education he's asking Kṛṣṇa that "Wherefrom this high temperature is coming?" //Kim idaṁ svit kuto veti deva-deva na vedmi.// We cannot understand. It is not possible. So many things are there even in this material world we cannot understand. We cannot get full information. But if we take Kṛṣṇa's instruction... He's giving personally the instruction in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// If we take care of them, then we can understand everything very easily. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so nice that simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa, you can understand everything. //Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati// [Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad 1.3]. So this is the all-perfect knowledge, perfect culture, perfect advancement of civilization. So everyone should take to it, and all questions should be..., is answered by Kṛṣṇa. You take it and become a perfect man.

Thank you very much.
