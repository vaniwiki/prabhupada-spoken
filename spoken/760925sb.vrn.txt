====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 1.7.28–29 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [chants verse]

> na hy asyānyatamaṁ kiñcid

> jahy astra-teja unnaddham
> astra-jño hy astra-tejasā
> [[books:sb:1:7:28|[SB 1.7.28]]]

[03:25]

Translation: "O Arjuna, only another //brahmāstra// can counteract this weapon. Since you are expert in the military science, subdue this weapon's glare with the power of your own weapon." [break]

> sūta uvāca

[04:36]

Translation: "Śrī Sūta Gosvāmī said: Hearing this from the Personality of Godhead, Arjuna touched water for purification, and after circumambulating Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, he cast his //brahmāstra// weapon to counteract the other one."

**Prabhupāda:**

So counteraction. This is military science. //Sāma Veda, Yajur Veda, Atharva Veda,// and military science also, one of the part of the //Vedas, Dhanur Veda.// It is called //Dhanur Veda//---how to utilize //dhanuḥ. Dhanuḥ// means bow and arrows. Similarly //Āyur Veda. Āyur Veda// means medical science, how to protect the //āyuḥ,// because the body is perishable. So in the Vedic knowledge, everything is there to guide the human society. It is stated in the beginning of //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, nigama-kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam idam// [[books:sb:1:1:3|[SB 1.1.3]]]. //Nigama// means //Veda,// and that is //kalpa-taru. Nigama kalpa-taror galitaṁ phalam idam.// It is compared with the tree. What kind of tree? Desire tree. //Nigama-kalpa-taroḥ. Kalpa-taru.// The //kalpa-taru// can be found in the spiritual world, not in this material world. The spiritual world is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā.// What is that? //Kalpa-taru, cintāmaṇi kalpa-taru. Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-taru.// In the spiritual world, Goloka Vṛndāvana, it is described that the houses, palaces, in that land, spiritual land, Goloka Vṛndāvana, is made of //cintāmaṇi, cintāmaṇi kalpa-taru.//

> cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-taru
> surabhīr abhipālayantam
> lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ
> govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi
> [Bs. 5.29]

So //kalpa-taru// means whatever you want you can get from that tree. Because everything is spiritual. For example, he can give you... Just like you are a spiritual being, I am also a spiritual being. If I say, "Bring me a glass of water," you'll bring. "Give me some fruit," you'll give me. "Bring this," you'll bring. Because you are spirit soul, you can supply me whatever I want. This is the spiritual idea. Not that I wanted a glass of water, you can supply me a glass of water only. No. If I want other things, you can supply me also. This is an example, crude example.

So when there is no material obstacles, then the spiritual world can be utilized for any purpose. Here, because we are covered with the material body... There are two energies, it is described in the //Bhagavad-gītā:// material energy and spiritual energy. //Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. This is material energy. And Kṛṣṇa says //apareyam:// this is inferior. //Aparā. Itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā.// There is another, superior energy. What is that superior energy? Living. It is not dead. //Jīva-bhūtā mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]. Without spiritual energy, this whole universe is useless, anywhere you go. The modern scientists, they are going to---so-called---they are going to this planet, that planet. And they do not find any spiritual energy. They simply see the material energy---sand and rocks. That cannot be. Because... They can bluff, because people are not aware of the whole science. They can bluff. In this material world there are two energies working: material and spiritual. There cannot be only material. There must be spiritual energy. So they say that there is no life, that means there is no spiritual energy. It cannot be accepted. It cannot be. It is out of question. Because here we find //jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]. There must be living entity who is conducting this material energy. This body is very beautiful, very useful. Why? Because the spiritual energy, the soul, is there. Otherwise, it has no value. So when there is a planet, when there are other things, how it has developed? This is a reasoning. This is sense. Because the material energy cannot develop without spiritual energy. //Jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho yaya idaṁ dhāryate jagat.// There cannot be anything material without spiritual energy. What is this body? How this body came into existence? Because the spiritual energy, the soul, is there. A dead child born, it will not grow, because the spiritual energy is not there. So it has to be concluded that as soon as there is material, a manifestation of the material energy, there must be spiritual energy. It cannot...

In the //Bhagavad-gītā// it is clearly said that this whole cosmic manifestation is combination of material energy and spiritual energy. So therefore in the //Vedas... Veda// means knowledge, //vetti veda vido jñāne.// In the Sanskrit verb //vid, vid-dhātu. Vid-dhātu// means knowledge, "to know." //Vetti veda vido jñāne vinte vid vicaraṇa//[?]. //Labhe vindati vindate.// So //vid-dhātu.// From //vid-dhātu// the "//veda//" has come. //Veda// means knowledge. So from the //Vedas// you can have all different types of knowledge, namely material knowledge and spiritual knowledge, both, perfectly. Because we have now forgotten our spiritual energy. We do not cultivate spiritual energy. Therefore the //Veda// is there. In the //Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// in simple Bengali language, it is said, //anādi-bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli' gela, ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa karila// [[books:cc:madhya:20:117|[Cc. Madhya 20.117]]]. Because these rascals, //anādi-bahirmukha,// do not know. [bird chirping in background] Just like this bird chirping, but he does not know what he is, wherefrom he is coming, where to go---nothing. That is low-grade life. So we are now forgetful of our spiritual energy, and because we do not know spiritual energy, therefore we have no knowledge of God. This is our position, and it is coming since very, very, very, very long time. Time immemorial. Therefore the //Vedas// are there. //Anādi-bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli' gela, ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa karila.//

So we have to utilize the //Veda-purāṇa.// The //Veda-purāṇa// is here in India. It is not for India; it is meant for the whole universe. But still, it is available in India. That is India's special position. Indian civilization is not very much interested with the four-wheeled civilization. India is interested in spiritual cultivation, //Veda-purāṇa.// So this science, as it is mentioned here, //unnaddham astra-jñaḥ.// So Arjuna was expert in military science, and still, he was a devotee. It is not that only a //brāhmaṇa// with very clean cloth and clean habit, //satya-śaucābhyām... Brāhmaṇa's// first qualification is truthfulness and cleanliness, //satya-śaucābhyām.// This is the first qualification. //Śamo damas titikṣā ārjavam, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. //Tyāgena satya-śaucābhyāṁ yamena niyamena vā// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. So this is brahminical qualification. But there are others also. A //kṣatriya,// he is expert in the military science, how to kill. So the killing art is there. You cannot make it null and void by advocating nonviolence. No. That is required. Violence is also a part of the society. Just like here is some itching sensation. This is violence. That is required for the comfort. So similarly, Arjuna was //kṣatriya.// He knew the art of killing. And still, Kṛṣṇa is... Kṛṣṇa also, He appeared as a //kṣatriya// in the dynasty of //kṣatriyas,// Vasudeva, son of Vasudeva. He also knew the art of killing. That is also one of the part of His business. //Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. //Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām// [[books:bg:4:8|[Bg. 4.8]]]. So //vināśa//---requires violence.

So we cannot decry violence. That is also required. Kṛṣṇa was speaking //Bhagavad-gītā,// the science of God, in the battlefield of Kurukṣetra. We cannot condemn violence. That is not possible. But there is no violence in the spiritual world. That is a fact. Violence is only in the material world. Therefore when Kṛṣṇa desired to fight... Because all desires are coming from Him, //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Anything that we have got experience, everything is there in God. Therefore He's God. Not that minus something. Nothing minus. Everything. //Akhila-rasāmṛta-sindhu. Raso vai saḥ.// These are the Vedic injunctions. He is the reservoir of all //rasa,// humor or mellow. So this is also a mellow. Sometimes cruel men, they take pleasure by killing. I've seen it. One hotel man was cutting the throat of one chicken, half-cut, and it was throbbing, jumping. His child was crying because he could not see such horrible scene. And the man, the hotel man, he was laughing and pacifying the child, "Why you are crying? Just see how he's throbbing, how he's jumping." So one subject matter, the //rasa// is different, humor is different. He's one..., enjoying one //rasa,// the father, and the child is crying. That is also another //rasa.//

So the whole world is full of //rasa. Ādi-rasa.// The sex life is called //ādi-rasa.// There is //bībhatsa-rasa, hāsya-rasa, karuṇa-rasa, mādhurya-rasa, vātsalya-rasa, sākhya-rasa, śānta-rasa.// There are so many //rasas//---twelve //rasas. Anaya//[?] //vyatireka, ādi-rasa.// So //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has described this //ādi// from //ādi-rasa. Ādi-rasa// means the conjugal love. That is called //ādi-rasa.// So //janmādy asya yataḥ.// Wherefrom the //ādi-rasa// comes? The attraction between man and woman, that is a fact. The attraction is there in everywhere. Either human society or animal society or bird society, bee society, the attraction is there. //Puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etam// [[books:sb:5:5:8|[SB 5.5.8]]]. This whole world is existing on //mithunī-bhāva,// sex. //Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham// [[books:sb:7:9:45|[SB 7.9.45]]]. These things are there. So wherefrom it comes, this //ādi-rasa?// Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura has described in his comment on //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// in the beginning, that Kṛṣṇa is the origin of //ādi-rasa, janmādy asya.// From there, this //ādi-rasa// is generated. That is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. So everything is there. Otherwise, imperfectness. So as there is //ādi-rasa,// Kṛṣṇa is enjoying with the //gopīs// and Rādhārāṇī, similarly, He enjoys with //bībhatsa-rasa, vīra-rasa,// killing---killing is also //vīra-rasa//---because He is the reservoir of all //rasas.// So //janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]. So do not think that this violence or fighting is bad. No. Nothing is bad when it is utilized for Kṛṣṇa. And nothing is good when it is utilized for your sense gratification. Everything is bad.

So here Kṛṣṇa ordered that this is //brahmāstra.// He could not understand that intolerable temperature, heat, and Arjuna inquired, "Wherefrom the heat is coming?" So Kṛṣṇa informed him that "This is due to //brahmāstra// released by Aśvatthāmā. This rascal does not know how to counteract it." //Naivāsau veda saṁhāram.// "He does not know." Formerly, in the military science, you have released one kind of arrow, if I am expert, then I can release another arrow which will counteract your arrow. //Naivāsau veda saṁhāram.// It is called //saṁhāram.// So Aśvatthāmā released that //brahmāstra.// Now Kṛṣṇa advised Arjuna that "You release this //saṁhārāstra,//" how to counteract. //Unnaddham astra-jñaḥ. Unnaddham:// "You know better than him how to counteract." //Hi astra-tejasā:// "By another..." [break] ...different //astras// are released by different expert military men. So that science is not yet discovered. By //mantra.// Just like here it is said that he took water, //apaḥ. Spṛṣṭvāpas taṁ parikramya. Apaḥ.// Just like we take, //oṁ apavitraḥ pavitro vā sarvāsvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā.// Similarly, //mantra// and water can be utilized for very, very important purpose. Simply //mantra// and water. So this is the science. This is called subtle science, not gross. They have discovered this atomic weapon---they require so many chemicals. But when you come to the higher stage, subtle, then //mantra// and water will do. Nothing more. No more chemicals. Simply //mantra// and water. That is yet you have to learn.

But these things are there in the //Vedas.// If you are a serious student of //Veda// you can also learn, you can also fight like Arjuna. There is no difficulty. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says //astra-jñaḥ. Unnaddham astra-jñaḥ.// You can also become learned in the higher science of military art. You can also utilize. But that requires brain, good brain. That is not possible now, because the culture is lost. Now everyone is //śūdra.// Nobody is //kṣatriya,// nobody is //brāhmaṇa.// By the time... //Kalau śūdra sambhava.// The //śūdras// cannot learn all these //Veda.// Because //śūdras// have no right to understand Vedic knowledge. It is meant for the //brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas.// Even not for the //vaiśyas. Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrāḥ.// They are rejected, woman and //vaiśya// and //śūdra.// Kṛṣṇa says. //Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrāḥ.// But Kṛṣṇa says, //te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim:// "Even woman and //śūdra// and //vaiśyas,// low grade, they can also get //parāṁ gatim,// promotion to the transcendental world." How? //Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]].

If you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then even these low-grade-born persons, beginning from //striya, śūdra, vaiśya,// and down, //caṇḍālas... Caṇḍālas...,// means less than the //caṇḍāla. Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśāḥ.// They are //caṇḍālas. Kirāta// means the black clan, or the Africans. So they are called //kirāta. Hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]. //Yavanas, khasādaya,// Mongolians, without any moustaches. //Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ ye 'nye ca pāpāḥ.// "Even there are still more low-grade, sinful society," //ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ,// "if he takes the shelter of a pure devotee, //śudhyanti,// becomes purified." Becomes purified. How? //Śudhyanti.// Because //prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// Lord Viṣṇu has got so exalted power that through His devotee He can purify anyone, never mind, even one happens to be //caṇḍāla,// and what to speak of others. //Kiṁ punar brāhmaṇāḥ puṇyā bhaktā rājarṣayas tathā// [[books:bg:9:33|[Bg. 9.33]]]. If they can be delivered, then what to speak those who are //brāhmaṇas. Brāhmaṇa// means //puṇya.// Without having background of pious activities, nobody can take birth in rich family, in //brāhmaṇa// family. Nobody can become highly learned person, nobody can become beautiful. //Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī// [[books:sb:1:8:26|[SB 1.8.26]]]. They're the action, reaction of //puṇya.// And just the opposite is //pāpa.// So everyone---there is no question of //pāpī// or //puṇya//---if anyone takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa, //māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ// [[books:bg:9:32|[Bg. 9.32]]], it doesn't matter. Everyone can be elevated to the transcendental position of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.

So this movement is there. Take advantage of it and elevate your life, and finish the material trouble. //Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. It is only simply full of miseries and temporary. This business must be stopped. And //yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]], simply by going back to home, back to Godhead, your all problems of life will be solved.

Thank you very much.
