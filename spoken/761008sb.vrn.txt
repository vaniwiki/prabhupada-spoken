**Prabhupāda:**

So in the previous verse it is described, //bhagavān devakī-suta.// Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa, Devakī-suta. Still, people may doubt that Kṛṣṇa, being Devakī-suta, how He can become the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because sometimes very powerful person is also called //bhagavān.// So such persons have very confidence in Viṣṇu. Viṣṇu is Caturbhuja. Therefore here, in this verse, Kṛṣṇa is confirmed to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead by adding this word, //caturbhuja.// Don't doubt. Because Kṛṣṇa has appeared with two hands, that does not mean He is not Bhagavān. He is Caturbhuja, to confirm it.

Actually, sometimes it is said that Kṛṣṇa is the incarnation of Viṣṇu. But actually Viṣṇu is incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. //Aham ādir hi devānām// [[books:bg:10:2|[Bg. 10.2]]], that is said in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// Viṣṇu also one of the //devas,// first, principal //devas:// Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara. Brahmā, Lord Viṣṇu and Lord Śiva, //guṇāvatāra,// Viṣṇu expanding Himself in three //avatāras. Sattva-guṇa// He takes charge Himself, //sattva-guṇa. Rajo-guṇa,// it is given to Brahmā in charge, and //tamo-guṇa// is given to the Lord Śiva. //Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya// [Bs. 5.44]. //Sṛṣṭi,// creation, is done by Brahmā, //rajo-guṇa;// and //sthiti,// maintenance, is done by Viṣṇu; and destruction is done by Lord Śiva, //tamo-guṇa.// He is not //tamo-guṇa;// in charge of //tamo-guṇa.// Just like somebody becomes superintendent of jail. It does not mean that the superintendent is also one of the prisoners. No. He's in charge of the jail department. Similarly, Lord Śiva, he's not in //tamo-guṇa.// He's transcendental. He is almost Viṣṇu. He's neither ordinary human being. Lord Śiva is in between //viṣṇu-tattva// and //jīva-tattva.// So how he can be in the //tamo-guṇa?// Nobody is... They are all transcendental, especially Lord Viṣṇu.

Lord Viṣṇu has nothing to do with these material affairs, as a big man, a rich man, has nothing to do personally, but he gets things done by his assistant, by his servant. It is like that. In the //Vedas// also, //Upaniṣad,// it is said, //na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate.// Lord Viṣṇu has nothing to do personally. //Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate, na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate// [Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad 6.8]. Nobody is equal to Him, neither nobody is greater than Him. Everyone is below. Therefore //viṣṇu-tattva// is //asamordhva.// Nobody is equal, nobody is higher. To consider equal to //viṣṇu-tattva// is //aparādha,// offense. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has warned this offense very strictly.

> prākṛta kariyā māne viṣṇu-kalevara
> aparāra nāhi ihāra upara
> [[books:cc:adi:7:115|[Cc. Ādi 7.115]]]

If somebody thinks Viṣṇu as one of the product of this material world, //prākṛta...//

> prākṛta moliye māne viṣṇu-kalevara
> aparāda nāhi āra ihāra rupa

Māyāvādī philosophers, they abuse that Viṣṇu's body is..., Viṣṇu comes, appears, He accepts a material body. That is condemned, condemned by Bhagavān in //Bhagavad-gītā. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam// [[books:bg:9:11|[Bg. 9.11]]]. He does not accept any material body. //Tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham// [[books:bg:4:7|[Bg. 4.7]]]. //Ātma-māyayā. Sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā// [[books:bg:4:6|[Bg. 4.6]]]. Not with material help. //Ātma-māyayā, cit-śakti.// So Kṛṣṇa, there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's soul and Kṛṣṇa's body. Just like we have got. We are different from this body, and Kṛṣṇa is not different from the body. He does not change His body. Although He assumes several //avatāra,// but He does not change His body. //Advaitam acyutam... Acyuta,// not different from the original personification, identification. //Advaita acyuta anādi ananta-rūpa// [Bs. 5.33]. Although He assumes so many varieties of //viṣṇu-tattva,// still, //advaita acyuta anādim ananta-rūpa ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣa nava-yauvanaṁ ca// [Bs. 5.33]. Therefore //viṣṇu-tattva// is..., never looks like old man. //Nava-yauvanam:// always young. Kṛṣṇa always young, //nava-yauvanaṁ ca.//

So in order to confirm Kṛṣṇa's position, here it is not Devakī-suta. Because one may doubt, that "Devakī-suta is ordinary human being, or living being." No. Here it is said, //catur-bhuja.// Here it is said, //bhagavān.// Here it is said, //catur-bhuja.// So we should always remember that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Being. And Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. Don't think that above Kṛṣṇa there is any other higher authority, either Brahman or Paramātmā or Viṣṇu. So many... Absolute Truth is manifested in so many features. But Kṛṣṇa is the original. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam. Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]].

It is summarized in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// that there are so many descriptions of the incarnation of Viṣṇu, but at the end, Vyāsadeva concludes that whatever incarnations are described here, they are //aṁśa-kalā. Aṁśa// means direct expansion, and //kalā// means expansion of the expansion. Just like Kṛṣṇa, the first expansion is Balarāma, Baladeva. And the next expansion is Saṅkarṣaṇa, Vāsudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna. The next expansion is Nārāyaṇa. The next expansion again second //catur-vyūha,// Saṅkarṣaṇa again. //Dvitīya-catur-vyūha.// Then next expansion, Viṣṇu, Mahā-Viṣṇu. Next expansion, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. And next expansion is Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. In this way, there are different expansion, but //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam. Ādyaṁ puruṣaṁ śāśvatam.// Kṛṣṇa is the original person. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. "I am not expansion of anyone." //Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. They are all //īśvaras,// controller. //Viṣṇu-tattva// is controller always. //Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram// [[books:bg:9:10|[Bg. 9.10]]]. Everywhere Viṣṇu is the supreme controller.

So every //viṣṇu-tattva// is controller. There is no doubt. And they have got equal power. Not that Lord Rāmacandra is less powerful than Kṛṣṇa. No. They have equal power. The example is described in the //Brahma-saṁhitā: dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya// [Bs. 5.46]. Just like one candle. You ignite another candle, you ignite another, another, another. But all these candles, they are equally powerful, although you can say, "This is first candle, this is second candle, this is third candle." Similarly, //viṣṇu-tattva,// everyone is equally powerful. Although Kṛṣṇa is first, Balarāma is second, Saṅkarṣaṇa is third, like that, but do not think They are less powerful. No. //Viṣṇu-tattva// means They are equally powerful. //Svāṁśa. Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan// [Bs. 5.39]. //Kalā.// Rāma is expansion of Viṣṇu, but it is not that Rāma is less powerful than Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is less powerful. //Rāmādi-mūrtiṣu kalā-niyamena tiṣṭhan nānāvatāram akarod bhuvaneṣu kintu// [Bs. 5.39]. There are so many //avatāras. Kṛṣṇaḥ svayaṁ samabhavat paramaḥ pumān yaḥ.// But Kṛṣṇa is the //paramaḥ pumān,// the Supreme Being, the Supreme Person. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. Everywhere. //Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. This is the conclusion of the //śāstra.//

So don't consider that Kṛṣṇa, because He has come, appeared in Vṛndāvana like a cowherd boy, never think... Of course, the Vṛndāvana-vāsī, they do not know what is Kṛṣṇa. They are villagers. They do not know. But they do not love anyone more than Kṛṣṇa. That is their qualification. They do not know even Viṣṇu. When the //gopīs// saw //viṣṇu-mūrti...// Kṛṣṇa assumed the //viṣṇu-mūrti.// They were passing. They said, "Oh, here is Viṣṇu. All right. //Namaskāra.//" They were not interested even with Viṣṇu. They were interested with Kṛṣṇa, although they do not know that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, if, without knowing what is Kṛṣṇa, if you simply become attached to Kṛṣṇa, then your life is successful. Simply, somehow or other, you become attached to Kṛṣṇa. //Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ...// [break] //...yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. Simply you have to... This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Somehow or other, you increase your attachment for Kṛṣṇa. Some way or other. //Yena tena prakāreṇa manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet// [Brs. 1.2.4]. This is Rūpa Gosvāmī's instruction. Somehow or other, you become attached to Kṛṣṇa. Then your life is successful.

So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to induce people how to become attached to Kṛṣṇa. That is //bhakti-yoga. Yena tena prakāreṇa manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet.// Then? //Vidhi-niṣedhāḥ.// There are so many rules and regulations for //bhakti-yoga.// Yes, there are. And Rūpa Gosvāmī says, //sarve vidhi-niṣedhāḥ syur etayor eva kiṅkarāḥ// [//Padma Purāṇa, Bṛhat-sahasra-nāma-stotra//]: some way or other, if you become attached to Kṛṣṇa, then all the //vidhis// and regulative principles and rules and regulations, they will act as your servant. They'll..., automatically there will be. Because as soon as you become attached to Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa said, //kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā.//

> kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā
> śaśvac-chāntiṁ nigacchati
> kaunteya pratijānīhi
> na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati
> [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]

//Kṣipram,// very soon. //Api cet su-durācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]].

Don't think that these Europeans or Americans, they are //mlecchas// and //yavanas.// That is //aparādha,// offense. Because they are //sādhu.// They do not know... They have accepted Kṛṣṇa without any hodgepodge understanding, that "This is also good, this is also good, this is also good." They are strictly following the instruction of their spiritual master. //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. Even a small child in our association, Śyāmasundara's daughter, she would go to somebody---she was only five years old---she would ask, "Do you know Kṛṣṇa?" So somebody said, "No, I do not know." "Oh, Supreme Personality of Godhead." She would preach like that. So they are convinced, //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.// This conviction is the foremost quality. Then other things will follow. //Sarve vidhi-niṣedhāḥ syur etayor eva kiṅkarāḥ.// So if one is simply convinced on this point, that //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam,// and he does like that, follows the principle, //kṛṣṇaika-śaraṇam,// [indistinct], //varṇāśrama-dharma. Kṛṣṇaika-śaraṇam.// That is wanted. //Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.// So do that. Stick to this principle, that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa is //para-tattva,// the Absolute Truth, and Kṛṣṇa is all-pervading. //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. Kṛṣṇa is everywhere. //Jagad avyakta-mūrtinā.// This //avyakta.// The Kṛṣṇa's potency is everywhere.

Therefore those who are advanced devotee, they do not see anything else than Kṛṣṇa. Everywhere he sees Kṛṣṇa. And that is a fact. Kṛṣṇa also teaches that "I am here." If you cannot conceive that Kṛṣṇa is everywhere present, Kṛṣṇa personally gives you instruction, "Here I am." //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. Everyone is drinking water at least four times, five times. So at the time of drinking water, or drinking anything, if you remember Kṛṣṇa then you become purified. //Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha// [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]. That is //yoga, bhakti-yoga.// If you practice only this. Whatever you drink, you drink something for some taste, so either you drink soda water or water or milk, or even wine---because the Europeans, Americans, they are accustomed to drink wine---but if they follow this instruction of Kṛṣṇa, that "This taste is Kṛṣṇa," then he remembers Kṛṣṇa. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// As soon as he brings Kṛṣṇa in his mind, he becomes a //bhakta.// So easy. Anyone can become //kṛṣṇa-bhakta// if he follows the instruction of //Bhagavad-gītā.// There is no difficulty. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// This is the simple process. //Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]], this is for ordinary class of men. But if you think that you are very advanced in learning, in Vedic literature and Vedic //mantras,// yes, then Kṛṣṇa says, //praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu.// That //praṇava-oṁkāra, oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ// [//Ṛg Veda// 1.22.20], that //praṇava// is Kṛṣṇa. //Praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu.//

So either you become a highly learned scholar in Vedic literature or you are simply an ordinary person, you can think of Kṛṣṇa and you become successful in your life. There is no difficulty. //Raso 'ham.// If you are ordinary person... Any, every, every person drinks water or drinks something. Let him immediately think of, as soon as he tastes, "Here is Kṛṣṇa." //Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca// [[books:bg:7:9|[Bg. 7.9]]]. A flower, very..., a rose flower, very fragrant. So as soon as you smell you can remember Kṛṣṇa: "Oh, this smell is Kṛṣṇa." Actually that is Kṛṣṇa. You cannot create that smell. It is Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's art. That, //puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca,// that //gandha,// that smell, flavor, is within the earth. Wherefrom the rose is coming? From this earth. But still the rose is so fragrant. You cannot take out the fragrance from the earth. Everything is there. //Sarva-kāma-dughā-mahī// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. Everything is within the earth, but you cannot take out. It is Kṛṣṇa. //Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svābhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca// [[books:cc:madhya:13:65#id4|[Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport]]]. He has got this power to exact, to extract //puṇya-gandha// through the rose flower. You haven't. You may be very big chemist, but you cannot do that. So in this way, if we study Kṛṣṇa, if you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then your life is successful. That we are teaching. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And these //śāstras// will help you.

But even if you do not read //śāstra,// if you always remember Kṛṣṇa, impression of Kṛṣṇa... The temple is made for layman. Even woman, child, if he sees daily Kṛṣṇa here, then he gets the impression. He can think of Kṛṣṇa, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Therefore the temple is there. Everyone should come every day, every morning, or as many times as possible, and take the impression of Kṛṣṇa and keep it within your core of heart and think of Kṛṣṇa. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām...// And offer little... You don't require to study //Vedānta// philosophy or this or that. Because what is the purpose of //Vedānta?// The purpose of //Vedānta// is //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. You have to understand Kṛṣṇa. So if you simply think of Kṛṣṇa, then you are greatest Vedāntist. Greatest Vedāntist. //Vedaiś ca sarvair. Vedānta-vid vedānta-kṛt ca aham.// He is the compiler of //Vedas.// So whatever instruction Kṛṣṇa has given in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that is all //Vedānta.// This simple instruction, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto,// this is //Vedānta. Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya// [[books:bg:7:8|[Bg. 7.8]]]. This is //Vedanta.// So to become Vedāntist means to understand Kṛṣṇa, follow Kṛṣṇa's instruction and be successful in your life.

Thank you very much.
