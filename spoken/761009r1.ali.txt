I got it about a year back and put in my garden because my wife needed, and we were getting it from somebody else's garden. So I told my gardener, "Why don't you put it in our own? We have plenty of land."

**Prabhupāda:**
It doesn't require to taken care of very much. It grows automatically.

Its growth is very good. And plenty of it. If Your Divine Grace gets any benefit from it, then it can be planted in each temple on one side. No problem. And then on your visits, that place where you will use.
