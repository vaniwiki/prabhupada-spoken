====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.5.23 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.] [break]

> na brāhmaṇais tulaye bhūtam anyat
> paśyāmi viprāḥ kim ataḥ paraṁ tu
> yasmin nṛbhiḥ prahutaṁ śraddhayāham
> aṣnāmi kāmaṁ na tathāgni-hotre

Translation: "O respectful //brāhmaṇas,// as far as I am concerned, no one is equal or superior to the //brāhmaṇas// in this world. I do not find anyone comparable to them. When people know My motive, after performing rituals according to the Vedic principles they offer food to Me with faith and love through the mouth of a //brāhmaṇa.// When food is thus offered unto Me, I eat it with full satisfaction. Indeed, I derive more pleasure from food offered in that way than from the food offered in the sacrificial fire." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**

> na brāhmaṇais tulaye bhūtam anyat
> paśyāmi viprāḥ kim ataḥ paraṁ tu
> yasmin nṛbhiḥ prahutaṁ śraddhayāham
> aṣnāmi kāmaṁ na tathāgni-hotre

So Ṛṣabhadeva is teaching us what is the value of brahminical culture. Human society without brahminical culture is animal society. We offer our obeisances to the Lord, //namo brāhmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// Kṛṣṇa is first of all interested to see whether in the society the //brāhmaṇa// and the cow is properly respected. //Namo brāhmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// His first business is to see that the //brāhmaṇa// and cow is being properly honored. Then //jagad-dhitāya// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 1.19.65]. Then automatically the whole world will be peaceful. This secret of success they do not know. Nobody is prepared to become //brāhmaṇa,// and so far cow protection is concerned, it is in the oblivion. This is the whole world position. Therefore it is in chaotic condition. It must be, because this is animal society. When these two things are neglected, it is animal society, and then other animal qualities and paraphernalia follow.

Therefore Ṛṣabhadeva personally speaking that //na brāhmaṇais tulaye bhūtam anyat.// There are 8,400,000 of living entities, and as we have studied yesterday, how gradually evolution comes, elevated. So here it is the conclusion: the evolution must come to the topmost platform of brahminical culture. //Satya śamo dama titikṣa ārjavaṁ, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam// [[books:bg:18:42|[Bg. 18.42]]]. Now people are not at all interested. If you advertise that "We are opening one //gurukula,// where brahminical culture will be instructed. Send your boys," nobody will send. They are not concerned anymore that "My son should be truthful, self-controlled, mind controlled," //śama dama. Śama// means mind-control, //samatā,// and //dama// means sense-control. Without controlling the mind, how you can control the senses? The //yoga// system is practiced to control the mind, to control the senses, because we have to evolve from animal platform to //brāhmaṇa// platform or spiritual platform, //sattva-guṇa.//

Unless we control the base qualities, namely the modes of ignorance and passion, you cannot be happy. It is not possible. //Tato rājas-tamo-bhāvāḥ. Rājas tamo-bhāvāḥ// means //kāma// and //lobhā.// So long I have lusty desires and so long I have greediness to acquire more and more and more, to enjoy senses more and more... That is greediness. One should be satisfied, the minimum possible.

//Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca sāmānyam etat paśubhir narāṇām. Āhāra// means eating. //Āhāra, nidrā,// sleeping, and fearing and sense enjoyment. These are required, but not for increasing but decreasing. Just like when a person is diseased he should not eat as he likes. Because he is diseased, doctor prescribes that "You take little barley water or glucose, no solid food, if you want to be cured." Similarly, these things are necessity so long this body is there, //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna.// But this should be decreased, not increased. That is human civilization, not to increase. Just like the Gosvāmīs in Vṛndāvana. They did not come here to increase //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna.// No. They came here to decrease. //Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau.// That is wanted. This is //vṛndāvana-vāsī,// not that to live in Vṛndāvana and increase this //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna.// This is not //vṛndāvana-vāsa.// The monkeys are also living in Vṛndāvana, and the dogs are also and hogs are living in Vṛndāvana. But they do not know how to decrease //āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam.// You'll see the monkeys, they are also in Vṛndāvana. But you'll find one male monkey followed by three dozen female monkeys. That is not vṛndāvana-//vāsa. Āhāra-nidrā.// That means it requires brahminical culture, //damo, śamo.// That is wanted. That is brahminical culture.

Unfortunately the present civilization, they are not meant for decreasing. They are simply increasing. The Western civilization means increasing the means of sense gratification, "machine, machine, machine, machine." So..., and the brahminical culture means //śamo damo titikṣa. Titikṣa// means without something I may suffer. Suffer. So one should be practiced to suffer. Suffer, that is //tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryenā// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. //Tapasya// begins from celibacy. We are practiced to sex life or sense gratification. //Tapasya// means first of all stop this. //Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. This is practice.

So to become fit for going back to home, back to Godhead, it is not so easy. It is not so easily... We have to make our material life almost zero. Not almost zero---practically zero. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. That is wanted, practice. Therefore this, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness center, is meant for practicing this //śamo damo titikṣa.// Therefore we want to see how far he is eligible to practice the //śamo damo titikṣa.// So some new boy come, and as soon as they are given some work, not very good for sense gratification, they go away. That means they are not prepared. It is better they may go away. In Bengal it is said, //dusta gorute sunya gwaloa//[?]: "If there is troublesome cows, better keep the cowshed zero, without cow. Don't allow." So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for elevating the animal class of men to the platform of //brāhmaṇa.// Therefore the sacred thread ceremony is given as second initiation, that "He has practiced now //śamo damo titikṣa ārjava,// and he has learned what is Kṛṣṇa, what he is, what is his relationship with Kṛṣṇa, now how to act for satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa." These are brahminical qualification. If one is elevated to this platform... This platform is called //sattva-guṇa. Sattva-guṇa.//

There are three //guṇas---sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.// If you remain in the lower platforms, //tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa... Tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa// means, as I have already explained, greediness and lust, desires. That is //tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa. Tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. What is that //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa?// Now, //kāma,// lusty desires, and greediness, not satisfied with the minimum necessities of life, want to increase more and more, more and more. That is called greediness. The Vedic civilization teaches that "Be satisfied with the minimum necessities of life. Don't increase unnecessary necessities of life, and then you have to work for it very hard like hogs and dogs." That's all. Then you have to work very... Modern world, they have increased their unnecessary necessities of life, and therefore you'll find how hard-working. In European and American cities we have seen how people are working very hard, beginning from morning at five o'clock till four o'clock next night, for sense gratification. So this is not civilization. This is condemned civilization. //Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. This is not civilization. This is animal civilization, working so hard day and night for eating. That is the business of the hogs and dogs. You will find the hogs and dog, they are loitering on the street whole day and night: "Where is food? Where is sex?" That is not civilization. They must be peaceful, //brāhmaṇa.// Of course, not that everyone can be elevated to the position of a //brāhmaṇa,// but at least they must have the chance to see that "Here is a class of men, //brāhmaṇa.//" That is wanted. Otherwise the civilization is failure.

Therefore it is said, //na brāhmaṇais tulaye bhūtam anyat.// Actual //brāhmaṇa,// not the so-called //brāhmaṇa.// That was the Vedic culture. Just like Kṛṣṇa Himself. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When He received Sudāmā Vipra, a //brāhmaṇa,// He immediately vacated His own seat: "My dear friend, sit down here." And, hmm... Kṛṣṇa's first wife?

**Devotee:**
Rukmiṇī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rukmiṇī. He [she] took immediately the //cāmara.// He [she] said, "My husband is respecting." But he was dressed very poorly, lean and thin. //Brāhmaṇa,// because they refuse unnecessary necessities of life, sometimes they look very poor, poverty-stricken. They are not poverty-stricken; they are the richest. //Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtiṁ śritāḥ, bhajanty ananya-manaso// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. Those who are engaged in //bhajana// never think of their poverty. No. They are not poor. Otherwise, if Sudāmā Vipra, externally he looked very poor, lean and thin, not very nice cloth... Kṛṣṇa is: "My dear friend, sit down here." He brought water, washed the feet, just respectable person, //guru, brāhmaṇa.// This is etiquette. Kṛṣṇa is showing personally. He is the king. He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He also respects a //brāhmaṇa.// When Nārada used to come to Kṛṣṇa, immediately He would get down from the seat and offer obeisances, and Nārada was smiling, "Just see Kṛṣṇa's //līlā.//"

So this is the way, //brāhmaṇa.// That //brāhmaṇa,// the India, the //brāhmaṇas,// their sons later on, later ages, taking advantage of the facility offered to the //brāhmaṇas,// so without qualification of //brāhmaṇa,// they wanted the facility for nothing, very cheap. Therefore the brahminical culture is failure now. They are... They should be real //brāhmaṇas, śamo damo.// But nobody is prepared to practice //śamo damo titikṣa,// but he wants the respect of a //brāhmaṇa.// This is the cause of India's culture being failure at the present moment. They... "First deserve, then desire." So without deserving, they desired. Therefore whole thing is..., it became false. So that is not the purpose. Even somebody says that "Without culture one can remain a //brāhmaṇa,//" but //śāstra// does not say that. //Śāstra// says culture is the first consideration.

> yasya hi yad lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ
> varṇābhivyañjakam
> yady anyatrāpi vinirdṛśyeta
> tat tenaiva vinirdiśet
> [[books:sb:7:11:35|[SB 7.11.35]]]

So //lakṣaṇam// must be, //lakṣaṇam,// the symptom, what is //brāhmaṇas'// symptoms.

So my request to you, the Europeans and American boys, you have been initiated as //brāhmaṇa// but you must practice the //lakṣaṇa.// Otherwise, if you think, puffed up, that "Now I have got the sacred thread. My business is finished. I can do whatever I like," no. That is not. //Lakṣaṇam. Lakṣaṇam// means symptoms. That you must observe, //lakṣaṇam. Yasya hi yad lakṣaṇaṁ proktam.// Then nobody can check you. You will be very much dear of Kṛṣṇa. //Namo brāhmaṇya-devāya go brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// If you keep yourself in the platform of a true //brāhmaṇa// as you are expected... It is not difficult. We have selected the four principles: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication and no gambling. That's all. If you keep to these practices, then you remain. And if you chant, then above //brāhmaṇa,// you become Vaiṣṇava. //Manmanā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]]. Qualify yourself as a //brāhmaṇa.// Qualify yourself as a Vaiṣṇava. Then your position is guaranteed. //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. Sure. Guranteed.

Here also said, //na brāhmaṇais tulaye bhūtam anyat// [[books:sb:5:5:23|[SB 5.5.23]]]. //Namo brāhmaṇya-devāya go brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.// So when Kṛṣṇa takes care of you, He..., attention is on you. Then who can...? //Māyā's...// There is no strength of //māyā// to touch you. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. //Māyā// may be there. Police may be there. Police is there, so what business I have got with the police if I am honest? If I am properly observing the rules and regulation of the government, what business police has got to touch me? //Māyā// is there. //Māyā// must be there. //Māyā...// [aside:] Don't stop. //Māyā// is there, but it does not mean //māyā// can touch you if you are actually surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. //Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te// [[books:bg:7:14|[Bg. 7.14]]]. So here it is [aside:] Sitting there. So Kṛṣṇa personally will take care. And to come to the //brāhmaṇa// stage, this is also... Everything is described. Everything is prescribed. If you have to follow again and again... We can come to the //brāhmaṇa// stage by a simple method, as we are practicing, that //nityaṁ bhāgavata. Naṣṭa-prāyeṣu abhadreṣu nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]]. //Bhāgavata-sevayā.// The book //Bhāgavata// and the person //bhāgavata.// Person //bhāgavata...// The //guru// is the symbolic representation of person //bhāgavata,// whose life is //bhāgavata;// and book //Bhāgavata.// So you have to serve two //bhāgavata, nityaṁ bhāgavata,// not the //bhāgavata-saptāha.// This is another cheating. //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.// There is no such thing as //bhāgavata-saptāha// in authoritative literature. They have manufactured as a business. But //bhāgavata// should be served //nityam. Nityaṁ bhāgavata.//

Who can do that? //Naṣṭa-prāyeṣu abhadreṣu.// By developing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, whose sinful life is almost nil, not completely nil but almost nil, //prāyeṣu.// How? //Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā.// If you engage yourself to serve, to hear //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam// and to serve the person //bhāgavatam. Nityam bhāgavata-sevayā. Bhaktiḥ, uttama-śloke bhaktir bhavati naiṣṭhikī:// then your //bhakti// will increase //uttama-śloke,// to the Supreme. //Uttama-śloka// means the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And when you come to that stage, not that completely pure---almost pure---by //nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā// [[books:sb:1:2:18|[SB 1.2.18]]], and increasing your devotional service, then you'll immediately be situated in the //brāhmaṇa// qualification. As soon as you increase your devotional service by serving person //Bhāgavatam// and hearing //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// immediately you become situated on the //sattva-guṇa. Tato rājas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye, ceta etair anāviddham// [[books:sb:1:2:19|[SB 1.2.19]]]. Then this //rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa// cannot touch your heart. The whole process is purification of the heart. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. Everything is there. //Kṛṣṇa-bhakti// is there. It is not an artificial thing. //Nitya siddha kṛṣṇa bhakti.// It is our natural relationship with Kṛṣṇa because we are part and parcel. Just like father and son. Son may be rebel for some time, but the affection between father... [break] [end]
