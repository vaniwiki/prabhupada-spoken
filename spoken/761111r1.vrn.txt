====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
So I saw that one, that Mr. Maidan, he has got so many boxes all down his room. So I asked, "What are these?" "No, these are different cinema house collection. The ticket, half of the ticket, is put into this box before entering. So I count this slip. Then I can understand what is the income. That's all. Let them do whatever they..." So I am simply asking, "How many books they are selling?" [laughter] If the sale is going on, "All right, that's all right. Let them do whatever they like." The books are printed and distributed? That is all right. Then other things, you do whatever you like. Never ask. Where is Arundhatī?

**Hari-śauri:**
Probably still upstairs.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ask her to make that bitter melon separately in little quantity.

**Hari-śauri:**
Just fried or...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, boil and then fried. Make it soft. So any letter? All right. [break] Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all.

**Antardhyāna:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Everyone is going to die. Who is going to live? Who is here? Can you show me anyone who is going to live? Can you show me?

**Antardhyāna:**
No, everybody's going to die.

**Prabhupāda:**
So today or tomorrow, everyone will die. So where is the anxiety? Die or not die, tomorrow or today, but one should chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all. Why one should be depressed? And everyone is going to die. I am going to die tomorrow, he is going to die day after tomorrow, he... Everyone will have to die. Who will live here? So what is the anxiety? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all.

**Devotee:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, she'll die here. [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody will live. Don't be anxiety. That's all. Anyone who has come to this material world will die. One is going to die today; another is going to die tomorrow. It is a question of first and second, but everyone will die. So before death one should be complete in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is success of life.

**Antardhyāna:**
But if...

**Prabhupāda:**
The tree is standing for thousands of years. So what is the use of living like that? A tree cannot chant Hare Kṛṣṇa but lives for thousands of years. Do you think that kind of living is very worthy, standing in one place, cannot move even, and what to speak of chanting? So you have got the chance to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Utilize that. Don't be anxious that "I am going to die." Who is going to live? Why don't you understand that? Nobody is going to live. So before death one should be complete in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is success.

**Manīṣā:**
[Antardhyāna's young daughter, terminally ill] But if one is not, Śrīla Prabhupāda, what will happen?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Hari-śauri:**
If one is not complete in their Kṛṣṇa consciousness then what will happen?

**Prabhupāda:**
She will get again birth in a human body. That is guaranteed so that he'll get again chance of chanting. That is also great gain. Ordinary person, he does not know what body he is going to get next body. But a person who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chanting, he is guaranteed. //Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe// [[books:bg:6:41|[Bg. 6.41]]]. He is guaranteed to take birth as human being in a very sacred family like //brāhmaṇa// and very rich family.

[pause]

So I have to go.

**Manīṣā:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is going to live here. Everyone is going to die. Before death, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Manīṣā:**
Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don't be worried.

**Antardhyāna:**
She is worried, Prabhupāda, about...

**Prabhupāda:**
What is the worry? I have already said everyone is going to die.

**Antardhyāna:**
She is worried about seeing the Yamadūtas. This is what she is worried about.

**Prabhupāda:**
Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, always think of Kṛṣṇa. That's all.

**Manīṣā:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is our business. The cats and dogs cannot do this. That is the advantage of human form of body.

**Antardhyāna:**
//Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Manīṣā:**
//Jaya,// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Manīṣā:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
