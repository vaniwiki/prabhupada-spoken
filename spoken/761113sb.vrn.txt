Translation: "My dear sons, you should not envy any living entity, be he moving or nonmoving. Knowing that I am situated in them, you should offer resects to all of them at every moment. In this way you offer respect to Me."

**Prabhupāda:**
You read the purport.

**Pradyumna:**
"In this verse the word //vivikta-dṛgbhiḥ,// meaning 'without envy,' is used.

[break] ...living entities are the abode of the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His Paramātmā feature. As confirmed in //Brahma-saṁhitā, aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. The Lord is situated in this universe as Garbhodakśayī Viṣṇu and Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu. He is also situated within every atom. According to the Vedic statement, //īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. The Supreme Lord is situated everywhere, and wherever He is situated is His temple. We even offer respects to a temple from a distant place, and all living entites should similarly be offered respect. This is different from the theory of pantheism, which holds that everything is God. Everything has a relationship with God because God is situated everywhere. We should not make any particular distinction between the poor and the rich like the foolish worshipers of //daridra-nārāyaṇa.// Nārāyaṇa is present in the rich as well as the poor. One should not simply think Nārāyaṇa is situated among the poor. He is everywhere. An advanced devotee will offer respects to everyone---even to cats and dogs.

“ 'The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision a learned and gentle //brāhmaṇa,// a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater or outcaste.' [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]] This //sama-darśinaḥ,// equal vision, should not be mistaken to mean that the individual is the same as the Supreme Lord. They are always distinct. Every individual person is different from the Supreme Lord. It is a mistake to equate the individual living entity with the Supreme Lord on the plea of //vivikta-dṛk, sama-dṛk.// The Lord is always in an exalted position, even though He agrees to live everywhere. Śrīla Madhvācārya, quoting //Padma Purāṇa,// states, //vivikta-dṛṣṭi-jīvānāṁ dhiṣṇyatayā parameśvarasya bheda-dṛṣṭiḥ:// 'One who has clear vision and who is devoid of envy can see that the Supreme Lord is separate from all living entities, although He is sitauted in every living entity.' Madhvācārya further quotes from //Padma Purāṇa,//

> upapādayet parātmānaṁ
> jīvebhyo yaḥ pade pade
> bhedenaiva na caitasmāt
> priyo viṣṇos tu kaścana

“ 'One who sees the living entity and the Supreme Lord as always distinct is very dear to the Lord.' //Padma Purāṇa// also states, //yo hareś caiva jīvānāṁ bheda-vaktā hareḥ priyaḥ:// 'One who preaches that the living entities are separate from the Supreme Lord is very dear to Lord Viṣṇu.' "

**Prabhupāda:**

> sarvāṇi mad-dhiṣṇyatayā bhavadbhiś
> carāṇi bhūtāni sutā dhruvāṇi
> sambhāvitavyāni pade pade vo
> vivikta-dṛgbhis tad u hārhaṇaṁ me

So, //premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti// [Bs. 5.38]. The atheist class men, they say that "I do not see God. How can I believe there is God?" But the advanced devotee, he sees every moment God's presence. //Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva// [Bs. 5.38]. He doesn't say that "I do not see God." //Santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti yaṁ śyāmasundaram.// And what is that God? It is not manufactured God. //Śyāmasundaram,// Kṛṣṇa. //Yaṁ śyāmasundaram,// it is particularly mentioned. God means //śyāmasundaram.// This is also..., appears to be contradictory. //Śyāma-sundaram.// We have got idea: what is black is not beautiful. But here Kṛṣṇa, //śyāmasundaram.// Although He is black, He is //sundaram. Barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam. Asitāmbuda,// black cloud. Black cloud, like that, color, but He is very //sundaram. Kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobham// [Bs. 5.30]: He's so beautiful that if you compare with millions of Kandarpa, Cupid... Cupid is supposed to be very beautiful. So if you bring together millions of Cupids, still, their combined beauty cannot be compared with Kṛṣṇa's beauty. But He's still //barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgaṁ, kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi// [Bs. 5.30].

So it is required that we develop our attachment for Kṛṣṇa. Then every moment you'll see Kṛṣṇa. There is no need of asking anybody, "Can you show me Kṛṣṇa? Can you show me God?" You will see automatically. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ// [Brs. 1.2.234]. You cannot ask Kṛṣṇa, "Please come here. I'll see You," just like you ask your dog or your servant. Kṛṣṇa is nobody's servant. Kṛṣṇa is the master. He may like you; He may not like. //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]. He is everywhere. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu cayān...// But He is not visible to the nondevotees. That is the... Unless you are devotee, you cannot see. //Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:18:55|[Bg. 18.55]]]. So that //bhakti// must be there.

So Kṛṣṇa is present here in this temple. This temple is meant for this purpose, that you come here, see Kṛṣṇa and become attached to Him. Then you will see Him twenty-four hours. This is the process. Not that, I have several times explained, that this Kṛṣṇa is marble statue. No. This is //nārakī-buddhiḥ. Arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti buddhir, nārakī buddhiḥ. Nārakī buddhiḥ.// This is warned. Kṛṣṇa is here. Kṛṣṇa is here in the temple, but He has come mercifully to be seen by you. Otherwise you are blind; you cannot see Kṛṣṇa. But He has appeared as //arcā-vigraha// so that... You are accustomed to see wood and stone, so He appears in your visible form, but He is Kṛṣṇa. You will understand He is Kṛṣṇa present when you have got enough love for Him.

So as it is stated in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that,

> mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha
> yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ
> asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ
> yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu
> [[books:bg:7:1|[Bg. 7.1]]]

This is the way. You increase your attachment, see Kṛṣṇa in the temple, //man-manā bhava mad-bhakto// [[books:bg:18:65|[Bg. 18.65]]], think of Kṛṣṇa, and chant Kṛṣṇa's name and offer obeisances Kṛṣṇa. These things you can teach even to the small children. They can be practiced to see Kṛṣṇa and increase attachment for Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. //Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.// But this //bhakti-yoga// should be practiced not from the nondevotees. Then it will be not possible. //Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogam..., mad-āśrayaḥ.// Not //jñānīs' āśraya// or //yogīs' āśraya.// No. Then you'll never be able to see. //Mad-āśraya.// Either you take shelter of Kṛṣṇa... You cannot take shelter of Kṛṣṇa directly; that is not possible. But one who has taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, you can take shelter of him. That is //mad-āśrayaḥ.// One //mat-āśrayaḥ:// "a person who has taken shelter of Me." That means His devotee, a pure Vaiṣṇava, a Vaiṣṇava //guru.// You have to take shelter of. Then you can practice //bhakti-yoga.// Then never mind what you are---//kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ, ye 'nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ// [[books:sb:2:4:18|[SB 2.4.18]]]---if you take shelter of a devotee of Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu, then //śuddhyanti:// you'll be purified. //Śuddhyanti.//

How it is possible, that he's born in low-grade family, //kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā?// How he became so purified that he can see? Now, //prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ.// This is Kṛṣṇa's influence. He can do that. If you take shelter, //upāśrayāśrayāḥ,// a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa is pleased to reveal Himself. That is Kṛṣṇa's special power, Viṣṇu's special power. He can be seen even by the //kirāta-hūṇāndhra andhra,// and He cannot be seen even by the most purified //brāhmaṇa.// That is His option. He is not exposed to be seen by everyone. That is not possible. So we have to learn through //bhakti-yoga// how to see Kṛṣṇa, how to understand Him. //Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet samit-pāniḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham// [MU 1.2.12]. These are required. You cannot jump over Kṛṣṇa and see Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible.

So everything is sitting place of Kṛṣṇa. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. He is even within the atom, so why not within yourself? He is everywhere. This vision should be developed. And //vivikta-dṛgbhis tad ahārhaṇam.// If you see in that way, that Kṛṣṇa is everywhere present... But that presence can be experienced by love and devotion. There is no other way.

Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.
