====== Room Conversation [partially recorded] ======

**Tejiyas:**
M. Channa Reddy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hm?

**Tejiyas:**
M. Channa Reddy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Tejiyas:**
About getting letters, this letter for the court case in America.

**Prabhupāda:**
Court case? Oh.

**Tejiyas:**
He had given us nice questioning, and some from our Members, who are members of Parliament and other persons like M. Channa Reddy himself. He said that he would approach the External Affairs Minister and ask him that..., the External Affairs Minister, he can make some sort of protest, either official or unofficial, about this type of dealings that are going on.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he has not given anything, writing.

**Tejiyas:**
No, but what he said... He said that he is the head of the state of U.P.... So he said if he gives a protest to the American government directly, that "This is not..."

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no question of protest that... This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is genuine movement.

**Tejiyas:**
I had gotten a letter from Gopāla Kṛṣṇa that he also wanted some letter in the form of protest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Protest? Why this nonsense suggestion is done? These are rascal things. You have no experience, and you do something which is...

**Tejiyas:**
I asked the governor to give a letter of...

**Prabhupāda:**
Why did you approach the governor without asking me? You cannot make the governor so cheap thing that you will go always and ask something. Unnecessarily spend money and waste time.

**Tejiyas:**
I met him in Delhi.

**Prabhupāda:**
He was there?

**Tejiyas:**
Yeah.

**Prabhupāda:**
But how governor can protest?

**Tejiyas:**
What he suggested in this case...

**Prabhupāda:**
He will suggest hundreds of things, but he cannot protest personally. That is not... What is the court case? That we have to place before the court, that "This is genuine cultural or religious movement." We are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. What Kṛṣṇa has said, we are trying to spread. This is genuine, the simple thing. We have not manufactured anything, Transcendental Meditation or like that. That is not our business. We are presenting simply what is stated there in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// If somebody said that "Bible is not genuine," will it be accepted? Thousands and thousands are claiming to be Christian on the basis of... Similarly, millions and millions of people in India, they know Kṛṣṇa, //Bhagavad-gītā.// How it is not genuine? That we have to prove, that's all. It's not that... Repeatedly we are speaking that what Kṛṣṇa has said, that is perfect. That's all. This is our business. Who will object to that? You could not present to the governor that Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement... Anyone can say, "Yes, it is based on //Bhagavad-gītā.// It is genuine." Any Indian can say. You have to take that to present in the court. If from official it is... How the official can deny it? It is genuine.

Now, about this sewer line, after all... [end]
