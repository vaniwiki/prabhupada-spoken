**Pradyumna:** Translation: "Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Thus the great well-wisher of everyone, the Supreme Lord, Ṛṣabhadeva, instructed His own sons. Although they were perfectly educated and cultured, He instructed them just to set an example of how a father should instruct his sons before retiring from family life. //Sannyāsīs,// who are no longer bound by fruitive activity and who have taken to devotional service after all their material desires have been vanquished, also learn by these instructions. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva instructed His one hundred sons, of whom the eldest, Bharata, was a very advanced devotee and a follower of Vaiṣṇavas. In order to rule the whole world, the Lord enthroned His eldest son on the royal seat. Thereafter, although still at home, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva lived like a madman, naked and with disheveled hair. Then the Lord took the sacrificial fire within Himself, and He left Brahmavarta to tour the whole world." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**

> evam anuśāsyātmajān svayam anuśiṣṭān api loka-anuśāsanārthaṁ mahānubhāvaḥ
> [[books:sb:5:5:28|[SB 5.5.28]]]

Here the important point is about monarchy. There are different types of government, of which monarchy is the most prominent style. Formerly everywhere, all over the world, the monarchy was prevalent. Even up to date some of the countries, they are maintaining monarchy, but only in name actually; the monarch has no power. So monarchy is good so long the king is as ideal as Bharata Mahārāja, Ṛṣabhadeva, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Mahārāja Parīkṣit, Lord Rāmacandra. That is the perfect type of monarchy. We have description of Rāma-rājya. We have got the word nowadays. They sometimes use "Rāma-rājya party," but without Rāma. This is their policy. Where is that Rāma? When Lord Rāmacandra returned from the forest, His brother, Bharata, was ruling as a saintly person. But as soon as the eldest brother came back, he entreated that "Now You sit down on the throne." But He first of all tested what kind of people in generally there are in the Ayodhyā. So when He understood that all the citizens, they are strictly following the //varṇāśrama-dharma,// then He agreed to accept the throne.

So both ways. The king should be ideal, as here it is, //paramahaṁsa. Mahānubhāvaḥ.// So, and the //prajā// should be also strictly following //varṇāśrama dharma.// Then this world will be happy. Otherwise it is not possible. Not one-sided. "The king is not good. Dethrone him. Kill him," and some rascals and fools in the name of democracy, they occupy the seat. What benefit will be there? The whole thing has to be changed, the //prajās// and the king. The advantage of democracy is there. By votes you can elect somebody as president. One has to follow the principle, monarch, one man on the head of the government. It may be a monarch or it may be a president---it doesn't matter---but there must be one chief executive officer on the head. That you cannot avoid. That is essential. Therefore if we do not have an ideal president or ideal king on the head, and the //prajās// also, the citizens, they do not follow the //varṇāśrama,// then there cannot be any peace.

The peace formula is given in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// that,

> bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ
> sarva-loka-maheśvaram
> suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati
> [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]

This is the peace formula. People should know that who is ultimately the proprietor. We are claiming the proprietorship of this land, but we are not proprietor actually. Actually the proprietor is Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He said, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]]. Unfortunately we are claiming God's property as our own. That means we are thieves. There is United Nation to formulate peace of the world, but truly speaking, it is an assembly of thieves and rogues. How there can be peace? The people must be trained up to know who is the proprietor. If the United Nation immediately accepts that this whole planet is the property of God and we are simply sons of God---not only human being but also the animals, the trees, the plants... There are 8,400,000 different forms of living entities, and Kṛṣṇa claims, //ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā// [[books:bg:14:4|[Bg. 14.4]]]: "I am the seed-giving father." And we, all living entities, we are sons of the supreme proprietor. Let us enjoy the father's property without encroaching upon others' share. //Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:iso:1|[Īśo mantra 1]]]. //Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam.//

But they will not accept it. They will artificially create some assembly of rogues and thief and pass resolution for fifty years, but no peace. They want to be united, but flags are increasing daily. We have seen in New York the flags are increasing. Actually, during Mahārāja Parīkṣit's time there was one flag only, and people were controlled by the Pāṇḍava king all over the world, and they were peaceful. During the Battle of Kurukṣetra, it was a family fight, so all the people of the world, they joined this side or that side. The Bhāratavarṣa means under the name of Bharata Mahārāja, who is //mahānubhāvaḥ.// He is not ordinary person. //Bharataṁ parama-bhāgavatam bhagavaj-jana-parāyaṇam. Bhagavaj-jana.// He is the follower of devotees, //bhagavaj-jana. Bhagavaj-jana// and //hari-jana,// the same thing. Hari means Bhagavān, and here it is stated, //bhagavaj-jana;// and //hari-jana,// the same thing. But nowadays //hari-jana// means if somebody comes and presents himself as //hari-jana,// immediately we understand he must be a //cāmāra// or //bhangi.//

So this is the position. //Hari-jana// means persons like Nārada, Vyāsa, Asita, like that, the personal servant of Kṛṣṇa. By rubber-stamp---"//hari-jana...//" In Bengali it is said, //kana chela nama padma locana//[?]: "One son is blind, and the father has given the name 'lotus-eyed.' " That you can do out of affection. A blind child you can call lotus-eyed; that is your business. But lotus-eyed means something else. Very beautiful eyes, then you can say lotus-eyed. So this is going on. I want some political aims, so I stamp the //cāmāras// and //bhaṅgis// as //hari-jana.// That's all. That you can call for your political purpose. But //hari-jana// does not mean that. Here it is, a example of //hari-jana, parama bhāgavatan. Parama bhāgavata// means the highest stage of devotees. //Kaniṣṭha-adhikārī, madhyama-adhikārī,// and then //uttama-adhikārī.// He is //parama-bhāgavata.// He has no enemy. //Kaniṣṭha-adhikārī,// he worships the Deity, but he does not know how to do good to others, neither he knows who is devotee. In the //kaniṣṭha-adhikara,// in the lower stage of devotional service, one cannot distinguish. But he should be engaged fully in Deity worship so that gradually he will develop his //mahā-bhāgavata// stage. And //madhyama-adhikārī// means he knows how to make others //hari-jana,// or devotee.

> īśvare tad-adhīneṣu
> bāliśeṣu dviṣatsu ca
> prema-maitrī-kṛpa upekṣā
> yaḥ karoti sa madhyamaḥ
> [SB 11.2.46]

He not only worships the Deity wholeheartedly... That is //prema. Īśvare prema.// But beyond that, //tad adhīneṣu//---he knows how to respect the devotees, //tad adhīneṣu. Īśvara adhīneṣu,// that means other devotees. Then he becomes //madhyama-adhikārī.// If he simply takes care of the Deity worship and if he does not offer respectful behavior to another devotee, he is //kaniṣṭha-adhikārī.// He is in the lower stage. So //īśvare tad adhīneṣu.// He must see that "Here is a devotee." He must have power to see that "Here is a devotee."

So how to deal with devotee? //Maitrī:// to make friendship with him. //Īśvare prema.// And to the devotees, friendship; not with others, friendship. Caitanya Mahāprabhu advised. When He was asked by a //gṛhastha// devotee how to behave like a Vaiṣṇava, what is the behavior of a Vaiṣṇava, He immediately answered that the standard Vaiṣṇavism is //asat-saṅga-tyāga,---ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra// [[books:cc:madhya:22:87|[Cc. Madhya 22.87]]]: "He must give up the company of //asat,// nondevotees." //Asato mā sad gamaḥ:// don't associate with nondevotee. If you want to make progress, don't associate. Associate does not mean to talk with a nondevotee is association. No. That we have to do. As gentlemen, as devotee, we can. But not intimately. Associate means //dadāti pratigṛhṇāti bhuṅkte bhojayate caiva, guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati ca// [//Upadeśāmṛta// 4]. These are intimate relationship, dealing: giving something to your friend, accepting something from your friend, feeding your friend, accept food from him, and disclose your mind to your friend and understand his mind. //Ṣaḍ-vidhaṁ prīti-lakṣaṇam.//

So with devotee we should deal in six ways, //ṣaḍ-vidhaṁ prīti. Īśvare prema tad-adhīneṣu maitrī.// This is friendly behavior. And //kṛpa bāliśeṣu:// those who are innocent, does not know what is God or what is our relationship with Him, but they are not atheist---they do not know---to such persons, //kṛpa, daya. Īṣvare tad-adhīneṣu bāliśeṣu.// And there is a class, //dviṣat, sura-dviṣat,// simply atheist. As soon as they hear the name of God, Kṛṣṇa, they become angry. Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu. Innocent child, five years old, Prahlāda Mahārāja, because he learned from Nārada Muni even from the womb of his mother how to become a devotee, and from the birth he was a devotee, and his father did not like, Hiraṇyakaśipu. Not only he did not like, he was prepared to kill his child in so many ways. That is atheism. Atheists are so much averse, //sura-dviṣat.// They are envious. So to such person the //madhyama-adhikārī// cannot preach, because it is useless waste of time. If one is innocent but not envious, we can preach there. That will be, I mean to say, fruitful. If we go to atheist and you go on speaking, he will never accept it. So don't waste your time in that way. That is //nāma-aparādha.// But because we have not so much power that we can convert an atheist to become theist or devotee of God... That requires special power.

So //mahā-bhāgavata// means he is above the //madhyama-adhikārī.// He does not see anyone nondevotee. He sees everyone devotee. He sees all living entities existing in Kṛṣṇa, and he sees Kṛṣṇa is living within the heart of everyone. That is //mahā-bhāgavata.// What is that verse? //Sarva...//

**Pradyumna:**
//Mayi paśyati...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mayi paśyati. Yo mām...// He is //mahā-bhāgavata.// He is //mahā-bhāgavata.// He is broad-visioned, everything. //Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam// [[books:bg:9:4|[Bg. 9.4]]]. In everything He sees Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's hand, Kṛṣṇa's energy. Actually that is the fact. What is this microphone? This is also Kṛṣṇa, because what is this? This is made of this material gross matter. //Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. //Bhūmi...// From earth the iron comes, the aluminium comes, the wood comes. So this is combination of //bhūmir āpo analo vāyuḥ,// Kṛṣṇa's energy. Therefore it is Kṛṣṇa. //Śakti śaktimatayor abheda.// There is no difference between //śakti// and //śaktimat. Śaktimat// is Kṛṣṇa, and //śakti,// the manifestation of His energy, of, I mean to say, gross energy... //Prakṛtir me bhinnā aṣṭadhā. Bhinnā...// Just like I am speaking, and this is recorded in the tape recorder. But when replayed, you will find that I am speaking. But I am not there. //Bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā.// This is //bhinnā,// originally coming from Kṛṣṇa, but it is an energy where you cannot find Kṛṣṇa directly. But it is Kṛṣṇa's energy.

The //mahā-bhāgavata// knows that, that although this material world is a world of forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa... Material world means when you forget Kṛṣṇa. Here you will find cent percent people, they have forgotten Kṛṣṇa. They do not care to know Kṛṣṇa, neither they have got any relationship with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is material world. Here the nature is how to forget Kṛṣṇa. There is a verse in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: īśād apetasya viparyayo 'smṛtiḥ// [SB 11.2.37]. That is called //māyā. Māyā// means //viparyayo 'smṛtiḥ.// Everything is in relationship with God, but he, the rascal atheist, he'll say, //jagad āhur anīśvaram// [[books:bg:16:8|[Bg. 16.8]]]: there is no //īśvaram.// This is materially... This is material world---forgetfulness. //Viparyayo 'smṛtiḥ.//

So the devotee's business is how to enlighten him to come to the point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, real //smṛti.// So this is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means it is an endeavor to bring the rascals and fools and atheists to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the most, I mean to say, important welfare activities in the human society. So that Bharata Mahārāja was therefore... He had the power. He had the power to control how to bring the citizens to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore he was selected to become the king, not a rascal by vote and come to the..., become president and you become happy. That is impossible.

Thank you very much.
