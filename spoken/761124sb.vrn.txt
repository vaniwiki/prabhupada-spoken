====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.6.2 ======

**Pradyumna:**
[Chants verse]

> ṛṣir uvāca, satyam uktaṁ kintv iha vā eke na manaso 'ddhā viśrambham anavasthānasya śaṭha-kirāta iva saṅgacchante.
> [[books:sb:5:6:2|[SB 5.6.2]]]

[02:57]

Translation: "Śrīla Śukadeva Gosvāmī replied: My dear King, you have spoken correctly. However, after capturing animals, a cunning hunter does not put faith in them, for they might run away. Similarly, those who are advanced in spiritual life do not put faith in the mind. Indeed, they always remain vigilant and watch the mind's action."

**Prabhupāda:**

> ṛṣir uvāca:
> satyam uktaṁ kintv iha vā eke na manaso 'ddhā viśrambham anavasthānasya śaṭha-kirāta iva saṅgacchante. 
> [[books:sb:5:6:2|[SB 5.6.2]]]

First of all, one must prove that he's trustworthy; then we can accept him as trustworthy. Our mind is not fixed up; very restless. //Cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa pramāthi balavad dṛḍham// [[books:bg:6:34|[Bg. 6.34]]]. This is right example. Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura. He was competent enough, //mukta-puruṣa,// but still, he was chanting regularly 300,000 times Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra.// Even Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that "Now you have become old man. You can reduce the number." //Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ kālāvasānī-kṛtau nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau cātyanta-dīnau ca yau vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.// Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī especially, he was very strict in the matter of following the regulative principles, Raghunātha dāsa Goswami. He was living in Rādhā-kuṇḍa. He was very rich man's son and practiced very rigidly //vairāgya.//

//Bhakti-yoga// means //vairāgya.// As far as possible to deny material necessities, that is //vairāgya.// It is called //vairāgya-vidyā.// Śrīla Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya has said, //vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. //Vairāgya-vidyā. Bhakti-yoga// means //vairāgya. Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt// [SB 11.2.42]. This is //bhakti-yoga:// no more any necessity for material things. //Niṣkiñcinasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya.// There are so many. Rūpa Gosvāmī, Sanātana Gosvāmī, they were liberated persons. Even Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He's God Himself, but still, to teach us, He was observing the regulative principles of a //sannyāsī// very, very strictly. These things, to teach us... Similarly, Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he's called Brahma-Haridāsa. Sometimes he is called Yavana-Haridāsa. //Yavana// means Muslim or those who are not in the Vedic principles, //yavana, mleccha.// Just like we have seen some temples, our foreign devotees are not allowed, because they have got the rules that //mlecchas// and //yavanas,// because they are very unclean, they should not be allowed. But that should not be applicable to the devotees of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, because they have learned how to remain clean, how to follow the... At least, they are expected. They promised at the time of initiation, "Yes, I shall not do this. I shall not do this." So if he's actually following the rules and regulations, he is no more unclean---simply by chanting.

> apavitraḥ pavitro vā
> sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā
> yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ
> sa bāhyābhyantaraḥ śuciḥ
> [Garuḍa Purāṇa]

He become... If we follow our promise... That is gentlemanly. If you have promised something, you must follow it. That is gentlemanly.

So because we may fail... There is chance; we are prone to fail. //Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. But sometimes we forget. Not sometimes---practically always we forget. That is material. When we forget that we are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, that is material life. Otherwise, if we remain servant of Kṛṣṇa, even in this material body, still, we are liberated.

> īhā yasya harer dāsye
> karmaṇā manasā vacā
> nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu
> jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate
> [Brs. 1.2.187]

So we must follow the rules and regulation very... Therefore it is said that viśrambham anavasthānasya śaṭha-kirāta iva saṅgacchante. We should not believe our mind, that we have become perfect. By mental dictation we should not be guided. That is a very bad practice, to think of, that "I have now become liberated, I don't require to follow the regulative principles." So we must be very careful.

Here we have quoted that, //yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat// [[books:bg:18:3|[Bg. 18.3]]], //yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva pāvanāni manīṣiṇām// [[books:bg:18:5|[Bg. 18.5]]]. //Yajña, dāna. Brahmacārī// should offer //yajña; gṛhastha// should give in charity; and //sannyāsī, vānaprastha,// should undergo //tapasya. Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma.// We should not give up this, these things. "Because I have become //sannyāsī//---I have given up my family---therefore I give up also all other regulative principles." No. That you cannot. The //sannyāsī// means... //Sannyāsī,// they have got also rules and regulation. Caitanya Mahāprabhu very rigidly followed. He did not lie down even on a quilt, only one naked cloth. He did not use... And no woman should come to offer Him obeisances very near. They must do it from a distant place. He was so strict. One of His personal associates, Haridāsa, Junior Haridāsa, he simply glanced over a young woman with lusty desire. He immediately rejected him: "Ask Haridāsa not to come anymore." So He never excused him very strictly. And Haridāsa, being disappointed, he... On his behalf, very close devotees like Sārvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya, Rāmānanda Rāya, big, big devotees, Svarūpa Dāmodara and others, requested Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu that "He has committed mistake, but he is Your personal servant. Kindly excuse him." Then Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "All right, then you can call him. You live with him. I shall go from here. You live with him; let Me go away." He was so strict. Then, when Haridāsa Ṭhākura Junior---the senior is another---then he committed suicide: "Now it is hopeless. I cannot come to Caitanya Mahāprabhu." He committed suicide. And when this information was given to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He did not regret. "Oh, this man has committed suicide? Yes, it is right." He said, "Yes, it is right." So He was so strict.

Therefore in the //śāstra// it is forbidden that Kali-yuga is very difficult to follow the rules and regulation of a //sannyāsī;// therefore better not to accept //sannyāsa. Kalau pañca vivarjayet. Sannyāsaṁ pala-paitṛkam devareṇa sutotpattiṁ kalau pañca vivarjayet// [[books:cc:adi:17:164|[Cc. Ādi 17.164]]]. Instead of becoming a false //sannyāsī,// do not accept //sannyāsa.// This is the injunction of the //śāstra.// But for preaching work we have to get the help of some //sannyāsī,// but we should remember that we are in Kali-yuga. We should not be sentimentally very much anxious---"Please give me //sannyāsa,// give me //sannyāsa//"---and then fall down and go to hell. That is not good. That is not good. If one is able to strictly follow the //sannyāsa// rules and regulation, he should take. Otherwise, Kṛṣṇa has said that //sannyāsa,// real //sannyāsa,// means one who does not take any remuneration for his service to Kṛṣṇa. That is //sannyāsa. Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ sa sannyāsī// [[books:bg:6:1|[Bg. 6.1]]]. "It is my duty. I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. To serve Kṛṣṇa is my duty." //Kāryam:// "I must do it." Actually that mentality is //sannyāsa.// It doesn't matter whether we have changed the dress or not, but if we decide it that "I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa; my only duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa," that is //sannyāsa.//

So better we should try to stay in this determination than to accept the //sannyāsa// order by changing the dress and then again we fall down. That is not very good. There are instances like that, but it is not at all good. We should not trust the mind. And even we take, we should be very, very vigilant on the mind. //Viśvāso naiva kartavyam.// Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, [chuckles] //viśvāso naiva kartavyaḥ strīṣu rāja-kuleṣu ca:// "Never trust woman and politician." He was a politician, and his wife was kidnapped. He had very bad experience of these two things, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita. Therefore he gave this injunction, //viśvāso naiva kartavyaḥ strīṣu rāja-kuleṣu ca:// "Never trust woman and politician." So Cāṇakya Paṇḍita was not inexperienced; he was very experienced. All the //ślokas// of Cāṇakya Paṇḍita---very useful for daily affairs. So similarly, we should not trust the mind, that "Now I have become liberated." Never think so. We should always remember that liberation is not so easy thing, but if we follow the rules and regulation, then there is every possibility of becoming liberated.

But this is the business in the human... //Tapaḥ.// That is the instruction. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattva// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. You must purify your existence. This is the only business of human life: //tapasya.// So //tapasya// means //brahmacārī. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. //Tapasya// means //brahmacaryeṇa,// no sex life. That is //tapasya,// real //tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena ca.// Even if you practice //yoga// system, this regulation must be followed, celibacy, not that fashion //yoga// system. Now in your country there are so many transcendental //yogīs,// and they say, "Yes, whatever you like, you can do. God has given you senses. You must enjoy." These are manufactured cheating processes. But actually //yoga// means //indriya-samyamaḥ. Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ.// Not gymnastic. That is not //yoga. Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ.// Mind control. The same thing, mind control. So mind you cannot control unless your mind is fully engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. These are the examples.

So Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī followed very strictly, Caitanya Mahāprabhu also followed very strictly, and the Rūpa-Sanātana Gosvāmī followed very strictly. Not that because one is living in Vṛndāvana with a short cut cloth and therefore he has become like Rūpa Gosvāmī... Rūpa Gosvāmī was fully engaged. //Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.// They were in Vṛndāvana, but they were always thinking how to do good to the people, to this material world. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja: //śoce tato vimukha-cetasa// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. //Sādhu's// concern is to think of the misled materialistic persons. They are always thinking, making plan how to elevate them, they are suffering. This is //sādhu. Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau, sādhu,// not that "I have changed my dress in such a way, and people out of sentiment will give me //roṭī,// and I shall eat and sleep." That is not //sādhu. Sādhu...// Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa, says who is //sādhu. Api cet su-durācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ// [[books:bg:9:30|[Bg. 9.30]]]. That is //sādhu.// Who has fully dedicated his life for Kṛṣṇa, he is //sādhu.// Even he has got some bad habits... Bad habits? A //sādhu// cannot have bad habits, because if one is //sādhu,// if in the beginning he has got some bad habit, that will be rectified. //Śaṣvad bhavati dharmātmā. Kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā śaśvac-chāntiṁ nigacchati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. If he's actually //sādhu,// his bad habits will be rectified very soon, very soon. Not that he's continuing his bad habits and also a //sādhu.// That cannot be. That is not //sādhu.// Maybe due to his past habits, he might have committed some mistake. That can be excused. But if he, in the name of //sādhu// and become a liberated person, he continues to do all nonsense, he's a cheater. He's not //sādhu. Api cet su-durācāro. Cet, yadi,// if by chance it is possible. But if he sticks to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then //kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā śaśvac-chāntiṁ nigacchati.// In the beginning there may be some mistake, but we must see that "Whether my mistakes are now correct?" That should be vigilance. Never trust the mind. That is the instruction here. Mind should not be trusted. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that "After getting up from your sleep, you take your shoes and beat your mind hundred times. This is your first business. And while going to bed, you take a broomstick and beat your mind hundred times. Then you can control your mind. Otherwise it is very difficult."

So this is... This beating with shoes and broomstick is also another //tapasya.// For men like us, who have no control over the mind, we should practice this //tapasya,// beating the mind with shoes and broomstick. Then it can be controlled. And //svāmī// means who has control over the mind. //Vāco-vegam, krodha-vegam, udara-vegam, upastha-vegam, manasa-vegam, krodha-vegam, etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt// [//NoI// 1]. This is Rūpa Gosvāmī's instruction. When we can control //vāco-vegam...// [child crying, Prabhupāda pauses] This is //krandana-vegam.// [laughs] They cannot control. They cannot control. Therefore they are child. The child can be excused, but if a person who is in the spiritual life, he cannot control, then hopeless. Then he's hopeless. This should be controlled. //Vaco-vegam, krodha-vegam, udara-vegam, upastha vegam.// But the most important thing is //udara-vegam// and //jihvā-vegam. Jihvā-vegam,// it is very controlled. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura said that "All the senses are there, but out of them, this //jihvā// is very dangerous." //Tā'ra madhye jihvā ati lobhamoy sudurmati tā'ke jetā kaṭhina saṁsāre.// It is very, very difficult to control the tongue.

Just we can see. Practically I have seen that we... Our prohibited injunctions are that we should not eat meat. So I have seen when on the plane... Of course, we never go to the hotel or restaurant, but on the plane we see so many European, American friends traveling. They are eating the meat---not very large quantity, very little quantity. Some of them are eating voraciously, no, but generally I see... But if they give up that little one piece of meat, say one ounce or two ounce, immediately we can save ourself from so much sinful activities, so many slaughterhouses running on all over the world. If we simply control the tongue, what is that? You are eating a piece of meat. But they cannot. They cannot. //Jihvā-vegam.// The tongue is dictating, "No, meat is very nice. Take it." A little. It is not much. He's not living on meat. There are loafs, there are vegetables. Actually he's living on that. Nobody takes two or three loaf, of the same weight meat. Meat, little quantity. But they take loaf, butter, rice, other things. Without vegetables, without food grains, you cannot live. It is simply for the tongue. //Tā'ra madhye jihvā ati lobhamoy sudurmati.// Simply for this tongue, little only. He cannot live simply on meat unless he's an animal exactly. He has to take vegetable, food grains, butter. These are milk products. Otherwise he has no chance to live. But for the tongue's sake he's taking little piece of meat, and for that reason, we have to maintain thousands and thousands of slaughterhouse. This is our position.

Therefore //tā'ra madhye jihvā ati.// Simply for the tongue we are committing so much sinful activities and becoming implicated, because implication means there is no God consciousness, no Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Two things are there: one is God, and one is the repetition of birth and death. There is no third way. Either you take God... This chance... This is a chance. This human form of life is a chance. Either you go back to home, back to Godhead, or go to hell. I think Christians also, they say. Two things are there. And in our //śāstra,// Kṛṣṇa says, //Bhagavad-gītā, mām aprāpya nivartante mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]. Two things are there. Either go this way or that way. Either go to hell or go to heaven. This is the general, yes. //Asat-saṅga-tyaga,-ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra// [[books:cc:madhya:22:87|[Cc. Madhya 22.87]]].

So if you are serious about going back to home, back to Godhead, we must be educated how to control the senses, how to control the senses. Therefore while eating, we are reminded that this eating is... If you do not take it as //prasādam,// then eating is sense enjoyment.

> śarīra avidyā-jāl joḍendriya tāhe kāl
> jīve phele viṣaya-sāgore
> tā'ra madhye jihvā ati lobhamoy sudurmati
> tā'ke jetā kaṭhina saṁsāre
> kṛṣṇa baro doyāmoy koribāre jihvā jay
> swa-prasād-anna dilo bhāi

> preme ḍāko caitanya-nitāi

**["O Lord, this material body is a lump of ignorance, and the senses are a network of paths leading to death. Somehow or other we have fallen into the ocean of material sense enjoyment, and of all the senses the tongue is the most voracious and uncontrollable. It is very difficult to conquer the tongue in this world. But You, dear Lord Kṛṣṇa, are very kind to us. You have given us this nice prasādam just to control the tongue. So now let us take this prasādam to our full satisfaction and glorify Their Lordships Śrī Śrī Radha and Kṛṣṇa, and in love call for the help of Lord Caitanya and Prabhu Nityānanda."]**

We should be very cautious, always remembering Caitanya-Nitāi and practicing the regulative principles, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra.// Then it will be all right.

Thank you very much. [end]
