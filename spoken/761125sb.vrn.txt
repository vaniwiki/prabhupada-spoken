====== Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam 5.6.3 ======

**Pradyumna:**
//Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya. Oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.// [devotees repeat] [leads chanting of verse, etc.]

Translation: "All the learned scholars have given their opinion. The mind is by nature very restless, and one should not make friends with it. If we place full confidence in the mind, it may cheat us at any moment. Even Lord Śiva became agitated upon seeing the Mohinī form of Lord Kṛṣṇa, and Saubhari Muni also fell down from the mature stage of yogic perfection."

**Prabhupāda:**

> tathā coktam-
> na kuryāt karhicit sākhyam

So it is advised herewith, //tathā ca uktam.// Although definitely from where it is quoted, it is not described, but it is heard by the //paramparā// system. That is also authority: not necessarily to know wherefrom it is quoted, but if it is current, it is also evidence. So it is said by //paramparā// system, we can understand, that "Do not make any friendship or," what is called, "compromise with mind. Do not do this." As I was saying yesterday, my Guru Mahārāja used to say that "When you get up, you beat your mind with shoes hundred times, and when you go to the bed, you beat your mind with broomstick hundred times." Then there will be no compromise. If you simply beat your mind... That is required. This is Vedic system. Now, if you want to bring somebody under your control, then you must always chastise him; otherwise it is impossible. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, the moral instruction, he also says, //lālane bahavo doṣās tāḍane bahavo guṇāḥ:// "If you pat your subordinate, then it will increase the faulty habits." //Bahavo doṣaḥ.// And //tāḍane bahavo guṇāḥ:// "And if you chastise, then they will improve." //Tasmāt śiṣyaṁ ca chatraṁ ca tāḍayen na tu lālayet.// Therefore it is advised, "Either your son or disciple, you should always chastise them. Never give them lenience."

So little leniency, immediately so many faults will grow. Now for our practical life we are known all over the world as shaven-headed. Is it not? Now we are becoming hair-headed. We are forgetting shaving, because there is little leniency. Immediately faulty things are creeping in. So we should be known as shaven-headed, not long-hair-headed. This is discrepancy. At least once in a month you must be clearly shaven-headed. In the bright fortnight on the day of //pūrṇimā,// four days after //ekādaśī,// once in a month in the bright fortnight, you must be shaved. It is not desirable that in grown-up ages also you should be chastised. That is not desirable. That is also difficult, because when the disciple or the son is grown up, if he is chastised, then he breaks. So before being chastised, you..., we should be conscious that "This is our rules and regulation. We must observe." Therefore it is advised by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, //prāpte tu ṣoḍaśe varṣe putraṁ mitra-vad ācaret:// "After sixteenth year of the disciple or the son, he should be treated as friend." Because if you chastise when he's grown-up, then he'll break up. That is also another risk. So our request is that instead of chastising, with folded hands I request you, don't you become hippies again by growing hair. Keep your head cleansed at least once in a month. That is my request. Neither I can chastise you. I am also old man; you are young men.

So here the same thing, //na kuryāt karhicit sākhyam.// To the subordinate never make compromise. We must keep always under control. Of course... Similarly, our mind... The mind is the cause of our material existence, //mano-dharma.// Why we are in this material world? On account of this change of mind. Our position is //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]]. We are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. But sometimes the servant thinks, "Why shall I remain a servant? Let me become master." That is natural. A master is always in comfortable situation. Sometimes the servant becomes envious: "Oh, why this man should always remain in comfortable position and we shall serve? Why not we become also in comfortable position? Let me eat as he eats," or "Let me sleep..." These are so-called comforts. So they want to imitate. When the living being imitates the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he falls down.

> kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vañcha kare
> pāśate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare
> [//Prema-vivarta//]

As soon as he forgets his position---he wants to imitate---that is the beginning of //māyā,// falldown. You should be very careful. Therefore the //brahmacārī...// We have to teach the //brahmacārī. Brahmācāri guru-kule vasan dānto guror hitam// [[books:sb:7:12:1|[SB 7.12.1]]]. This is //brahmacārī:// not for his personal benefit, but //guror hitam.// Then he is //brahmacārī.// Not that a //brahmacārī// has to become a very learned scholar in grammar and //turīya...// These are secondary things. First thing, he has to learn how to control the senses, //dānta;// how to control the mind. //Śamo damaḥ.// This is the beginning of brahminical life. If you cannot control your mind, if you cannot control your senses, there is no question of becoming //brahmacārī. Brahmacārī, brahme cārati iti brahmacārī.// And //brāhmaṇa// means //brahma jānāti iti brāhmaṇaḥ.// So these are the beginning, //brahmacārī. Brahmacari// means who is always in Brahman activities. That is //brahmacārī.// Or //brāhmaṇa// means one who knows the Supreme, Supreme Brahman, Paraṁbrahman. So if you understand Kṛṣṇa, then immediately you are liberated. //Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān// [[books:bg:10:12-13|[Bg. 10.12]]]. So if we understand Kṛṣṇa, then we are both //brahmacārī// or //brāhmaṇa, brahma-jñāna, brahma-bhūtaḥ.// These words are there in the //śāstra: athāto brahma jijñāsā.// Therefore the real life is to inquire about Brahman. Inquiring, inquiring, when the conditioned soul... Now it is //jīva-bhūtaḥ.// So long we are conditioned by the material nature---//prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ// [[books:bg:3:27|[Bg. 3.27]]], //bhuṅkte prakṛtijān guṇān// [[books:bg:13:22|[Bg. 13.22]]]---then we are //jīva-bhūtaḥ.// Otherwise, when we come to our real position, that is //brahma-bhūtaḥ.//

So that //brahma-bhūtaḥ// position can be attained. If we strictly follow the rules and regulation of //brahmacārī// or //brāhmaṇa,// then it is possible. Otherwise it will be simply formality. Practical life, //brahma-bhūtaḥ.// And how do I know that he has become //brahma-bhūtaḥ? Prasannātmā// [[books:bg:18:54|[Bg. 18.54]]]: no more moroseness, always jolly in any condition of life. Not that "For want of this, one is suffering." There is no want. That..., that mentality, that attitude, should be increased. And when it is fully increased, then he's fully satisfied, //ātmārāma.// That is called //ātmārāma.// Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. He said, //svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi,// "Oh, I am fully satisfied." //Naivodvije para duratyayā-vaitaraṇyās tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahā amṛta-magna// [[books:sb:7:9:4|[SB 7.9.4]]]. As Prahlāda Mahārāja said, "Now I am in the ocean of nectarean. I have no suffering." That is //brahma-bhūtaḥ.// So this //brahma-bhūtaḥ...// [break]

//Yoga indriya-saṁyamaḥ.// And the king, head of the //indriyas,// is the mind. So //manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhāni indriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. We are struggling in this material world, //prakṛti-sthani, bhuṅkte prakṛtijān guṇan.// Because we are in this material world---there are three modes of material nature---either of them controlling me. //Prakṛtijān guṇan.// Therefore you find three kinds of men. Practically we can see richer class, a middle class and a poorer class. That is always existing. I thought, before going to your country, USA, I thought that "The Americans, they are all rich." That's a fact. I don't say that you are poor. You are rich in comparison to India. But still, when I saw that on the Bowery Street so many drunkards are lying down on the footpath, then I thought, "Here is also third class." So either by drinking they are lying on footpath, or by becoming hippies they are lying in the park, and the police is kicking on their face. That means that three classes are always there, either you go to America or hell or heaven---anywhere---because there are three //guṇas: sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa. Prakṛtijān guṇān.// You cannot escape it. There is no question of becoming poor. In the Western countries the government arrangement is so nice. And still, voluntarily they will become poor. That is hippies. Because nature is working. Most of these hippies, they are coming from very respectable family, rich family. I have seen. In Beverly Hills when I was walking in the morning I saw nice boy, there is car, he is coming from a very nice house, but he's a hippie. I have seen it. [laughs] Why he has become hippie? //Prakṛtijān guṇān.// He might have taken his birth in a very rich family, respectable family; because the mode of nature is working, voluntarily he has become hippie. This is going on all over the world. Therefore we have to come to the platform of //sattva-guṇa, brāhmaṇa// platform. //Brāhmaṇa// platform.

So one endeavor is gradually to come to the //brāhmaṇa// platform. But if we take //bhakti-yogam,// immediately you become on the //brāhmaṇa// platform. This is the advantage. //Kecit kevalayā bhaktyā vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ, aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena...// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]. What is that?

**Pradyumna:**
//Nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that word?

**Pradyumna:**
//Nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Nīhāram?//

**Pradyumna:**
The darkness.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. I forget. Mist, what is the English? //Nīhāram iva,// yes. //Nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ. Bhāskaraḥ// means sun. So when there is mist, [Hindi] as soon as there is sunrise, immediately everything... Otherwise it is very difficult to drive away the fog. The railway train, I have seen it also. In the mid-ocean, immediately there is fog, and the ship immediately stops because there is danger of collision with other ship. At least the ship in which I was going to your country, //Jaladuta,// so the captain, Mr. Pandia, he immediately used to stop in the mid-ocean and giving horn, "//gaw, gaw,//" like that. So that was danger, very dangerous. When the sea is rough there is no fog. And as soon as the sea is not rough there is fog. So whether you will go this way or that way, there is misery. Therefore this world is called //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. You subdue something, and another problem is there. And you solve that problem---another problem... Problematic. //Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam.// Kṛṣṇa is recommending that this is //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam.// How we'll subside this //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam?// And we are... Our struggle is... Kṛṣṇa said, "This is //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam.// This place is for miseries," and these rascals are trying to adjust things. //Bahir-artha-māninaḥ// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. These rascals, they are trying to bring peace by material arrangement, //mūḍha.// Therefore they are //mūḍha.// It is not possible. Kṛṣṇa has made it suffering. How you can become happy here? But these rascals will not understand. Within the suffering they will try to become happy. That is not possible. The toilet room he wants to make a Deity room. How it is possible? That is not possible.

So it is //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]], and you have to practice //tapasya// if you want to get out of it. //Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattva// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. We are now accustomed to this miserable condition of life. If you want actual happiness, then you have to undergo austerity, //tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet yasmād brahma-saukhyam anantam.// You are hankering after happiness. That happiness, //brahma-sukha,// eternal happiness, you will get by practicing //tapasya.// So don't believe, don't make friendship with your restless mind. This is the instruction. Don't make friendship. Simply beat the mind with shoes and broomstick; otherwise cannot bring in control. And other alternative is //kevalayā bhaktyā.// So if you can engage your mind at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then it is possible. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ// [[books:sb:9:4:18-20|[SB 9.4.18]]]. Then Kṛṣṇa will control. Kṛṣṇa means light. Darkness..., you are suffering in the darkness. So somehow or other if you bring a light, there is no darkness.

> kṛṣṇa---sūrya-sama; māyā haya andhakāra
> yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa, tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra
> [[books:cc:madhya:22:31|[Cc. Madhya 22.31]]]

If you keep always within your mind Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet... You can see Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, Deity, Baladeva, Balarāma, how He is nicely standing. You can see the nice lotus feet. Don't try to see the face all of a sudden. Try, practice to see the lotus feet constantly. //Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāra...// This is a chance. This temple means to practice how to think of Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, Balarāma's lotus feet, always. //Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.// Immediately you become //bhakta.// And as soon as you become a //bhakta, kecit kevalayā bhaktyā vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ, dhunvanti aghaṁ kṛtsnam// [[books:sb:6:1:15|[SB 6.1.15]]]: all kinds of disturbances will be subsided, //dhunvanti. Nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.// This is the //śāstra// injunction.

So in this Kali-yuga, to control the mind the //yoga// practice and this practice and..., this is all failure. It will never be possible. It was possible in the Satya-yuga. //Kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇum// [SB 12.3.52]. Now they have manufactured so many meditation. The real meditation is //dhyāyato viṣṇu,// the Viṣṇu form, four-handed Viṣṇu form, and always try to see Him. That is wanted. These rascals have manufactured something, some light, some this, some that---//yoga// practice, sleeping. This will not help. //Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ// [SB 12.13.1]. //Yogīs'// meditation means to see Viṣṇu //mūrti.// That is wanted. But they are impersonalists: "Viṣṇu is //māyā.// Why shall I think of Viṣṇu? Let me see some light." What is that nonsense light? That is also //māyā.// So what is the wrong there, instead of seeing the light if you see the Viṣṇu form? "No, the light is good. //Oṁ// is good." But when there is question of personal meditation, they protest.

Therefore //tad-vijñānarthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet// [MU 1.2.12]. In order to learn everything very clearly, he must have the shelter of a bona fide //guru. Ādau gurvāśrayam.// If we want release from all this disturbance of the material world, then the first and foremost thing is //ādau gurvāśrayam.// Then,

> tad viddhi praṇipātena
> paripraśnena sevayā
> upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ
> jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ
> [[books:bg:4:34|[Bg. 4.34]]]

//Guru// means //tattva-darśī. Tattva-darśī.// Otherwise he's useless, waste of time. One has seen the //tattva. Vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam, brahmeti paramātmeti// [[books:sb:1:2:11|[SB 1.2.11]]]. //Guru// means one who knows what is Brahman, what is Paramātmā, what is Bhagavān---not partial knowledge. The //jñānīs,// the so-called //jñānīs,// they reach up to the //brahma-jyotir,// that's all. But that is not complete knowledge. The //yogīs,// they reach, utmost, Paramātmā. That is also not complete. Better than the //jñānīs,// but it is not complete. //Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti.// When he comes to the platform to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then that is //bhakti.// That is //bhakti.// Therefore Kṛṣṇa says,

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gatenāntaratmānā
> śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ
> sa me yuktatamo mataḥ
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

So if you want to be first-class //yogī,// always think of Kṛṣṇa within your mind. Do not make friendship, that you have become very much advanced: "Now my mind is controlled." It is not so easy, sir. Therefore it is warned, //na kuryāt karhicit.// Never trust your mind. Always distrust. In any moment it, the mind, can drag you. The example is given here, //caskanda tapa aiśvaram. Yad-viśrambhāc cīrṇaṁ caskanda tapa aiśvaram.// Even Lord Śiva---he is called Mahadeva; not only //deva,// but Mahādeva---he became captivated by seeing the young woman's incarnation, Mohinī-mūrti. Became so much captivated. The description is there in the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.// But as soon as the Mohinī-mūrti demonstrated the features of the breast, immediately Lord Śiva became so mad that he forcibly went there and embraced, and there was discharge, Lord Śiva. And what to speak of us? What we are? [laughter] Therefore it is... Lord Śiva is all right, but by their example they are teaching us that "A personality like me become victimized by this //māyā's// influence. What you are?" Why you should trust and make friendship with your mind, that "I am now complete," artificially? Don't do that. Therefore it is warned, //na kuryāt. Na kuryāt karhicit.// Never trust your mind; always try to control. And the easiest method recomended in the //śāstra// and confirmed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu---//harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma iva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty...// [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]].

**Devotees:**
//...eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda! [end]
