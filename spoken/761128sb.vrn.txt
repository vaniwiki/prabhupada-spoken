Translation: "Lord Ṛṣabhadeva was the head of all kings and emperors within this universe, but assuming the dress and language of an //avadhūta,// He acted as if dull and materially bound. Consequently, no one could observe His divine opulence. He adopted this behavior just to teach //yogīs// how to give up the body. Nonetheless, He maintained His original position as a plenary expansion of Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. Remaining always in that state, He gave up His pastimes as Lord Ṛṣabhadeva within the material world. If, following in the footsteps of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, one can give up his subtle body, there is no chance that one will accept a material body again." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**

> athaivam akhila-loka-pāla-lalāmo 'pi vilakṣaṇair jaḍavad avadhūta-veṣa
> [[books:sb:5:6:6|[SB 5.6.6]]]

So this is also opulence of Kṛṣṇa, //jaḍavad avadhūta-veṣa.// Although He is the proprietor, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram// [[books:bg:5:29|[Bg. 5.29]]], still, this is another opulence, how to become renounced. This is another opulence. It is as good as the other opulences. //Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya.// All the op..., means property, money, wealth---these are //aiśvarya.// And He says, Kṛṣṇa, //sarva-loka-maheśvaram.// Not only in one planet but all the universes, all the planets within the universes, they are all the properties of Kṛṣṇa. //Sarva-loka-maheśvaram. Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya vīryasya// [Viṣṇu Purāṇa 6.5.47]. Strength... What is that? Eh?

**Indian man:**
//Dharmasya hi apavargasya jñāna-vairāgya...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah. So //yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ jñāna-vairāgya.// This is //vairāgya.// Not that Kṛṣṇa is simply enjoying sixteen thousand palaces, sixteen thousand queens, and millions of descendants, //yadu-vaṁśa.// This is another side. And this is another side: //vairāgya. Jñāna-vairāgya. Jñāna...// We can understand a little piece of His contribution of //jñāna: Bhagavad-gītā.// That is a little piece of His stock of knowledge. Five thousand years He spoke, and still it is being continued, not only in India, but also all over the world. This is //jñāna.// So anyway---strength. When He was seven years old, Kṛṣṇa, He lifted the Govardhana Hill. //Jñāna-vairāgya,// everything complete. That is God. Nothing less. Not that, that "I am rich man, but I cannot lie down on the street." Not that kind of //vairāgya.// He is complete, completely different from a rich person. //Akhila-loka-pāla.// He is the controller of the whole universe; still, you see His //vairāgya.//

So Kṛṣṇa consciousness means //vairāgya-vidyā. Vairāgya-vidyā nija bhakti-yogam// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. //Bhakti-yoga// means //vairāgya-vidyā.// We should under... That He is teaching by His personal behavior. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He also taught us //vairāgya-vidyā.// He, when He was a //gṛhastha,// He was the most learned scholar in Navadvīpa. When He was sixteen years old He defeated a very great learned scholar, Keśava Kāśmīrī. He was requested by Caitanya Mahāprabhu to make some stanzas praying the Ganges. So he immediately made one hundred //ślokas.// And Caitanya Mahāprabhu, at that time sixteen years old, He was a student of grammar. So He pointed out on the sixty-fourth //śloka// so many defects. He was surprised, that "This boy is a student of grammar, and He has picked up so many mistakes in my composition." One of the prominent mistake was //bhavānī-bhartā. Bhavānī-bhartā. Bhavānī// means the wife of Bhava, Lord Śiva. And He pointed out, "Who can be //bhartā,// he..., her, again?" So both of them were //paṇḍita,// yes. And there were so many mistakes He pointed out. So that was His learning. He was known as Nimāi Paṇḍita. Of course, //brāhmaṇas// were all called //paṇḍita.// Still in India that is the practice. The //brāhmaṇas// are addressed as "//paṇḍitjī,//" because //brāhmaṇa// cannot be //mūrkha.// That is not possible. Then he's not a //brāhmaṇa.// He must be a scholar. At least he must know what is the ultimate goal of knowledge.

So in the Kali-yuga we do not expect everyone to be very great scholar. That is not possible. But if he knows what is the aim of education, what is the objective of education, then he is also scholar. Just like our Gaura-Kiśora dāsa Bābājī Mahārāja. He was illiterate. He could not sign his name even. But he became the spiritual master of the best scholar of his time, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. So it is not the education, A-B-C-D. In Bengal we say //anguam//[?]. No. What is the purport of education? The purport of education is spoken by Kṛṣṇa Himself: //vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. If one understands Kṛṣṇa and takes to the shelter of His lotus feet, he is also the biggest scholar.

> yoginām api sarveṣāṁ
> mad-gata antarātmanā
> śraddhāvān bhajate
> sa me yuktatamo...
> [[books:bg:6:47|[Bg. 6.47]]]

So therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended, //kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.// By His practical life, when Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī criticized Him, that "You are a //sannyāsī,// and You do not read //Vedānta,// and You simply chant and dance..." This was the question. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu replied that "My Guru Mahārāja found Me a great fool. Therefore he advised Me that 'You have no jurisdiction in studying //Vedas,// because You are not a scholar. You are not a very highly learned. You are a //mūrkha.//' " //Guru more mūrkha dekhi karilā śāsana// [[books:cc:adi:7:71|[Cc. Ādi 7.71]]].

So who will read //Vedānta// at the present moment? There is no education. But if we follow the footsteps of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that //Vedānta// philosophy is not for ordinary person, simply if we chant---//harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam//---then you get the same result. What we get by studying //Vedānta// and Vedic literature, if we understand that //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]], and we sacrifice everything for achieving the mercy of Kṛṣṇa, then our //Vedānta// study is complete. That is the instruction of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam
> kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā
> [[books:cc:adi:17:21|[Cc. Ādi 17.21]]]

And pratically we see in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, all you are young Westerners, you never study //Vedānta,// but you can surprise many so-called Vedāntists how to understand Kṛṣṇa. How it has become possible? Simply by your firm faith in your spiritual master and Kṛṣṇa and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. //Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau// [//ŚU// 6.23]. This is the Vedic process. If we have got firm faith in //guru// and firm faith in Kṛṣṇa---//guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpayā pāya bhakti-latā-bīja// [[books:cc:madhya:19:151|[Cc. Madhya 19.151]]]---then you get the seedling of //bhakti-latā.// Some way or other, we have to come to this //bhakti-latā,// increasing or nourishing the //bhakti// creeper. That will be effective.

So those who are //jñānīs,// very learned scholars, they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. //Vedeṣu durlabhaṁ.// It is not by academic education one can understand Kṛṣṇa. //Yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ// [[books:bg:7:3|[Bg. 7.3]]]. They so many mistakes they commit. They say it is //kalpanā,// so many things. But here Kṛṣṇa as Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Kṛṣṇa as Ṛṣabhadeva, Kṛṣṇa as Kṛṣṇa Himself, They are teaching us how to become pure devotee. Because //sva kalevaraṁ jihāsur ātmanaḥ.// Before leaving your this body, you must be self-realized. That is the aim of life. //Bahūnāṁ sambhuvām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. We have got this life, human form of life, and how to utilize this human form of life? How to achieve the //vairāgya-vidyā?// This is //vairāgya-vidyā:// no more interest in material things. That is //vairāgya-vidyā.// Even to the body. That is... Ṛṣabhadeva is teaching us. This is //vairāgya-vidyā. Bhakti-yoga// means //vairāgya.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu also has spoken the same thing, //niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad bhajanonmukhasya// [[books:cc:madhya:11:8|[Cc. Madhya 11.8]]]. //Niṣkiñcanasya.// If you actually want to become a pure devotee, then you have to make this material way of life completely zero. //Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam// [Brs. 1.1.11]. Then it will be possible. If you have still a pinch of attraction for material life, then it will be stopped, your promotion to the other, spiritual world. Simply attachment to Kṛṣṇa, that will make you advanced. //Janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ, tyaktvā deham// [[books:bg:4:9|[Bg. 4.9]]]. He can, after giving up this body, //mām eti.// He does not accept any more the material body. He is immediately promoted to the spiritual world and Goloka Vṛndāvana, Vaikuṇṭha. There are many millions of Vaikuṇṭha planets in the spiritual world.

So if we become //vairagī... Vairagī// means no attachment for this material world. How to become completely freed from all our attachment of this material world, that is being exemplified by Ṛṣabhadeva. He doesn't take care even of the body. Although He is //Vaikuṇṭha-puruṣa...// How comfortably He lives in Vaikuṇṭha-loka. //Lakṣmī-sahasra-śata-sambhrama-sevyamānaṁ// [Bs. 5.29]. We are expecting, "One woman or wife will look after my comforts," but there Kṛṣṇa is taken care of by hundreds and thousands of women. And who are they? Lakṣmī. They're all goddess of fortune, not ordinary women. Lakṣmī has two features: //māyā// and the goddess of fortune; the same Lakṣmī according to position. Just like a government has got two departments: criminal department and civil department. So the government is the same, but there are two departments. This //māyā// is criminal department, and Vaikuṇṭha is civil department. Vaikuṇṭha means there is no anxiety, and //māyā// means always anxiety. //Sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad grahāt// [[books:sb:7:5:5|[SB 7.5.5]]]. Because we accepted the jurisdiction of //māyā,// they are //asad-grahāt. Asato mā sad gamaḥ.// Therefore the Vedic instruction is, "Don't remain in this //asat.//" //Oṁ tat sat.// "Go to the real life." //Jyotir gama.// "Don't remain in the darkness." This is Vedic instruction.

So anyone who has accepted this material world as very comfortable... It is not comfortable; it is simply suffering. Kṛṣṇa says, //duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. And still, if we want to be happy in this material world, //bahir-artha-māninaḥ...// These fools, they are trying to be happy within this material world. Material means external energy, //bahir-artha-māninaḥ. Na te viduḥ svārtha gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā// [[books:sb:7:5:31|[SB 7.5.31]]]. This is //durāśayā,// the hope which will never be fulfilled. But this we do not... //Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān// [[books:sb:7:9:43|[SB 7.9.43]]]. So unless there is //vairāgya,// there is no question of happiness. But we cannot attain //vairāgya// immediately; therefore the //vidhi-mārga, vidhi-mārga-bhakti:// to rise early in the morning, to attend //maṅgala ārati,// to offer Deity flowers, fruits, and in this way we shall be engaged twenty-four hours. Then //vairāgya-vidyā// will gradually develop. //Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje// [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]. Then the //anartha...// This material life is simply //anartha,// has no meaning, because we are creating another life. Without any spiritual knowledge, if we simply give ourself to the action and reaction of material nature, then we are making progress on the path of //mṛtyu-saṁsāra vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]. And if we attain Kṛṣṇa, then //mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam, nāpnuvanti// [[books:bg:8:15|[Bg. 8.15]]]. The two ways.

So our request is that you have taken to this //vairāgya-vidyā.// So //vairāgya-vidyā,// we do not say that you starve, don't eat anything, don't sleep at all. No. It should be regulated. //Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārtham upayuñjataḥ// [Brs. 1.2.255]. Don't be attached to eating, sleeping. That is not good. But you must eat, you must sleep as little as possible, and try to conquer over it. My mind dictating, "Sleep seventeen hours." No. That is //tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa// [[books:sb:6:1:13-14|[SB 6.1.13]]]. Why shall you sleep more than four hours or five hours, or utmost six hours? That's all, not more than that. That is //vairāgya-vidyā.// We have to learn it. That is devotional service. //Vairāgya-vidyā nija-bhakti-yogam// [[books:cc:madhya:6:254|[Cc. Madhya 6.254]]]. He's teaching. Kṛṣṇa Himself is teaching. Here you see. Ṛṣabhadeva is Kṛṣṇa. //Vairāgyā-vidyā.// Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He taught //vairāgya-vidyā.//

> tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ
> dharmiṣṭha ārya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam
> māyā-mṛgaṁ dayitayepsitam anvadhāvad
> vande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam
> [SB 11.5.34].

So opulence, even Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Kṛṣṇa appeared in a //kṣatriya// family, very opulented. Lord Rāmacandra appeared in a //kṣatriya// family, kingdom, opulence. He also accepted //vairāgya-vidyā.// Father requested, "My dear son, Your mother likes that You should go to the forest." Immediately accept, "Yes." This //śloka// is applicable to Lord Rāmacandra. //Tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīm// [SB 11.5.34]. He was going to be coronated next day king, but immediately, by the order of His father, He left everything. //Vairāgya... Tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rāj...// Is there any instance throughout the history of the whole world that a prince was going to be king tomorrow, and on the order of father he left everything? This is //vairāgya-vidyā.// This is called //vairāgya-vidyā. Tyaktvā sudustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ dharmiṣṭha ārya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam. Ārya-vacasā.// Elderly person is called //ārya.// Respectful person is called. //Ārya// means one who is advanced. //Ārya// does not mean meat-eaters, Āryan family. No. Āryan means one who is advanced in civilization, they are called Āryan, not these fool and rascals, Āryan. No. //Ārya-vacasā.// By a superior person---His father, Mahārāja Dāsaratha, said---immediately. Similarly, Caitanya Mahāprabhu also...

This //śloka// can be applicable to Caitanya Mahāprabhu's life. He also became a //sannyāsī, ārya-vacasā.// One //brāhmaṇa// cursed Him. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, to receive some blessings from the //brāhmaṇas,// when He was boy, He was voluntarily trying to give some service to the //brāhmaṇas// who were engaged in bathing in the Ganges. He'll clear the place because the //brāhmaṇa,// after taking bath in the Ganges, would sit down, would chant //mantra.// So He'll cleanse and He'll wash the cloth, and in... Voluntarily He was doing that, service. So one //brāhmaṇa// blessed Him, "My dear boy, You'll be very happy in Your family life. You'll have good wife, very opulent position." And Caitanya Mahāprabhu was blocking the ears. The //brāhmaṇa// said, "What is this?" "No, this is not blessing, sir." "Oh, it is not blessing? Then You'll never be happy in Your family life." "Yes, this is the..." [laughter] "This is all right." So therefore He took //sannyāsa. Arya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam// [SB 11.5.34]. Similarly, Lord Rāmacandra, //ārya-vacasā yad agād araṇyam.// These are the characteristic of the Personality of Godhead. Try to follow Them; not imitate, but follow.

Thank you.
