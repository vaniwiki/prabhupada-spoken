Translation: "While He was wandering about, a wild forest fire began. This fire was caused by the friction of bamboos, which were being blown by the wind. In that fire, the entire forest near Kuṭakācala and the body of Lord Ṛṣabhādeva were burned to ashes." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**

> atha samīra-vega-vidhūta-veṇu-vikarṣaṇa-jāta dāvānalas tad
> vanam ālelihānaḥ saha tena dadāha

So //dāvānala.// We have got some description of //dāvānala// in our daily prayer, //saṁsāra dāvānala-līḍha-loka.// The //dāvānala// is explained here, what is that //dāvānala.// Nobody goes to set //anala,// fire, in the forest. I saw //dāvānala// first in my experience at Nainital Station. Very high hill, and there was fire, blazing fire upon the hill. Nobody went there to set fire, but there was fire. So how that fire takes place, that is explained here, //samīra-vega-vidhūta-veṇu-vikarṣaṇam.// In the big jungles there are bamboo trees, and they are very densely situated. When there is wind, very forceful, the friction causes fire. So similarly, this material world is compared with this //dāvānala. Saṁsāra dāvānala.// Nobody wants that there will be trouble. In your country there is another kind of fire that is not //dāvānala.// In the city there is electric //anala.// And especially in New York, you know, twenty-four hours the fire brigade is working, //dung-dung-dung-dung-dung-dung-dung.// Nobody wanted, but there is fire, just to prove that you people, you have avoided jungle life but you cannot avoid //dāvānala.// This is the proof. You can make arrangement, very large arrangement for living comfortably, but you cannot escape //dāvānala.// That is not possible.

Therefore //saṁsāra dāvānala-līḍha-loka.// The whole material world is blazing fire. //Saṁsāra dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam.// Now, this //dāvānala...// Just like in the forest, you cannot send your fire brigade. That is not possible. Neither you can go there to help the animals for extinguishing the fire by bucketful of waters. That is also not possible. Helpless. Similarly, this //saṁsāra dāvānala,// you cannot extinguish it. So how it will be extinguished? //Saṁsāra dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam.// You have to beg for the mercy of Kṛṣṇa; then this blazing fire can be extinguished. Not by your arrangement. That is not possible. //Trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam.// That cloud is mercy cloud, not this ordinary cloud. Because //dāvānala,// the example, personal experience that on the hill of Nainital, some thousand feet high, how this fire will be extinguished? The extinguished it will be when there is cloud on the sky and there is rainfall. Otherwise it is not possible. Similarly, the mercy cloud, //kāruṇya, kāruṇa ghanāghanatvam...// So just like ordinary cloud is made possible by evaporating water from the sea, similarly, Kṛṣṇa has the sea of mercy, //kāruṇayamaya, kāruṇa-sāgara.// Kṛṣṇa's another name is Kāruṇa-sāgara. So as the air evaporate or the heat evaporate from the sea and the cloud is formed in the sky, similarly, one who has connection or the power to evaporate the mercy sea of Kṛṣṇa, he can extinguish the //saṁsāra dāvānala.// And that is //guru. Guru// is the cloud, or he is the agent of drying water from the ocean of mercy of Kṛṣṇa and turn it into a mercy cloud and pour water on the //saṁsāra dāvānala,// and then it is extinguished. //Saṁsāra dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam, prāptasya kalyāṇa.//

Therefore //guru// must be authorized person, not that //bhūmi-phala-guru//[?]. No. "I am //guru,//" no. You cannot become //guru// unless you are agent to draw out the mercy water from the ocean of mercy of Kṛṣṇa. That is //guru.// And therefore a //guru// is not an ordinary person. He is the representative, bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, //kṛṣṇa se tomāra, kṛṣṇa dite pāra:// "Vaiṣṇava Ṭhākura, Kṛṣṇa is your property. If you like, you can give." //Vedeṣu durlabhaṁ adurlabhaṁ ātma-bhaktau// [Bs. 5.33]. You cannot get Kṛṣṇa by studying //Vedas.// That is not possible. There is Kṛṣṇa in the //Vedas,// but you cannot pick up. It is not possible. But if you go to the Kṛṣṇa's favorite person... //Kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.// Kṛṣṇa's very dear servant, confidential servant, is //guru.// Nobody can become //guru// unless he is in confidence of Kṛṣṇa. //Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścid me priya-kṛttamaḥ// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. These things are there. Not that by magic one can become //guru.// No. He must be... //Saṁsāra dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam, prāptasya kalyāṇa.//

Everything is there in the //śāstra.// We have to see whether a person is actually bona fide agent of Kṛṣṇa. Then we accept him as //guru.// Otherwise, useless waste of time. //Gurur apy avaliptasya kāryākāryam ajānataḥ. Guru// is very confidential serv... //Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ. Guru// is //sākṣād hari;// there is no distinction between //guru// and Kṛṣṇa. Just like if you have got some business with a very big man, when his representative comes, you treat him as the same person because he is authorized agent. That is natural. Just like in India during British days, the governor general, viceroy---his name was viceroy---so people treated him exactly like the king, viceroy, in place of the king. Although he was a servant, but still, the honor was given to him just like the king. His dress was like king. He was given honor like king. Wherever he would go, he was received like the king. But he is not king. He does not say that "I am king," but his honor is like the king. //Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair, uktaḥ.// It is said in our all..., that you sing always, //vede gaya yahāra carito.// You read this verse daily. //Guru-mukha..., vede gaya yahāra car...// What is that? Eh? Who can sing this?

**Gurudāsa:**
//Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete kariyā... Vede gāya jāhāra carito.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. //Vede gāya jāhāra carito.// This is according to, strictly according to the version of the Ve... //Sākṣād-dhari...// You'll see. This is... Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is singing, //vede gāya yāhāra carita,// and Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, he is also singing, //sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.// So there is no difference. Not that one //ācārya// will say, "I have seen..."---so-called //ācārya,// not real //ācārya//---"I have seen in dream." The other day the letter came? He has seen, realized in dream, //nitāi-gaura rādhe-śyāma.// This is not the process. Process is the //śāstra,// authority. That is we have to. Not that jugglery: "I have seen in dream I have to become //guru.//" No. Whether you are actually in terms of the //śāstra?// Whether actually you are dear to Kṛṣṇa, you are most confidential servant? That we have to test.

And what is the confidential servant of Kṛṣṇa? Everything is explained. Kṛṣṇa says, //ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati// [[books:bg:18:68|[Bg. 18.68]]]. This //paramaṁ guhyam.// What is that //paramaṁ guhyam? Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is //paramaṁ guhyam,// Kṛṣṇa said. //Guhyād guhyatamam.// What is that verse? Who can say? Just before saying //sarva-dharmān parityajya,// Kṛṣṇa said that "You are My very dear friend. Therefore I am talking to you the most confidential part of knowledge." Is it not? What is that confidential part? //Sarva-dharmān parityajya:// "Give up everything. Simply surrender unto Me." This is confidential knowledge. //Jñāna, karma, yoga,// this will not help. It will take some time. You can waste your time in that way, you are at liberty, but real //dharma// is that "You fully surrender unto Me. Don't talk nonsense." Arjuna was talking so many nonsense things. So Kṛṣṇa ultimately said, "My dear Arjuna, you are My confidential friend. Therefore I am asking you. You do this. Don't waste your time. It will not help." It will help---//bahūnāṁ janmanām ante// [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]. You can go on with your learning, with your study of //Vedas,// with your practice of //yoga// or ritualistic ceremonies, //karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa,// but unless you come to this point---//sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]---there is no happiness. That is not possible. This is the confidential...

So if this confidential knowledge, one who preaches without any compromise, he is the confidential servant of Kṛṣṇa. There is no compromise. This is real religion. The Kṛṣṇa says, //na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścid me priya-kṛttamaḥ// [[books:bg:18:69|[Bg. 18.69]]]. So this is the person who has received the authority to draw mercy water from the ocean of mercy of Kṛṣṇa. //Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.// And what Kṛṣṇa said five thousand years ago, the same thing Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. Same thing. There was no change, as there was no change between the statement of Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura and Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. //Sādhu śāstra.// As //śāstra,// there is no change. Not that "Modernize. The //śāstra// should be changed." No. That is nonsense. That is not //śāstra. Śāstra// cannot be changed. "Circumstantially, it will be changed, seasonal changes." No. That is not //śāstra. Śāstra// means it is perpetual. What Kṛṣṇa said five thousand years ago or Kṛṣṇa said some forty millions of years ago to the sun-god... //Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam// [[books:bg:4:1|[Bg. 4.1]]]. He says, "I am talking to you that //purātanaṁ yogam.//" Not that "Because it has passed millions of years and now it is a different time, so I will have to change." No. He said, "I am talking to you that very old system." Is it not? Just see. The //śāstra// cannot be changed. God's word cannot be changed. Then what will be the difference between God and ourself? He is always perfect. He is always perfect. What He said forty millions of years ago, what He said five thousand years ago, that is also correct up to date. That is //śāstra.// Not that "So many years have passed and it has become old. Now let us reform it and put it into new way." No. You can put the same thing in a new way, but you cannot change the principle. //Sādhu śāstra guru-vākya, tinete kariyā aikya. Śāstra// is never changed. And the //sādhu... Sādhu// means who follows the //śāstras.// He is //sādhu.// He also does not change. //Sādhu, śāstra.// And //guru? Guru// means who follows the //śāstra// and //sādhu.// So there are three, the same. A //guru// will not change, that "It was spoken five thousand years ago. That is not applicable now. Now I am giving you something new, jugglery." He is useless. //Sādhu śāstra guru-vākya tinete kariyā aikya. Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma kārataḥ, na siddhim avāpnoti// [[books:bg:16:23|[Bg. 16.23]]]. These things are there.

So the //saṁsāra dāvānala-līḍha-loka,// these eight stanzas of Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, is very important. We sing daily. That's very good. So this is... This world is //dāvānala.// Just like Ṛṣabhadeva, He wanted fire; He did not require any matches. No. Fire can be... By His will there will be fire. Formerly //yajña// fire was also ignited. What is that wood?

**Devotee:**
//Araṇi.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Araṇi,// yes. Not with matches. So it is ordinary thing, the friction of the bamboo, electricity. It creates electricity by friction. The electricity is also friction. Similarly, fire is created, and the dry leaves of bamboo tree, they set in fire. Then gradually the whole forest is in blazing fire. And especially the snakes, they are the first sufferers, because they remain on the ground and there are dry leaves and it takes fire very quickly, so they cannot fly away. Other animals, they can... Nobody can escape, but they can try, because they can go fast. But the snake... Similarly, when there is catastrophe in the world, the persons like snakes---cruel, envious---they suffer first, like the snake. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has said, //sarpaḥ krūraḥ khalaḥ krūraḥ.// There are two envious living entities, very dangerous. What are they? One is snake. And another? The man whose habit is like snake. Without any fault he will bite. Without any fault.

So just like we are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So what is our fault? That we are trying to make men---no illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating, no intoxication, and they take it otherwise. They take: "It is very dangerous." Without any fault they are finding fault. This is snake. //Sarpaḥ krūraḥ khalaḥ krūraḥ.// No fault, but still fault-finding and giving us trouble. So you'll find so many persons, without any fault they'll bite. A snake, without any fault... You are passing, and you are taking some fruit from the tree. If there is snake, it will bite---the //krūraḥ.// So Cāṇakya Paṇḍita said, "There are two, two kinds of //krūraḥ,// envious living entities. One is the snake; another is the man snake, or a man habituated to the snake quality." So //sarpaḥ krūraḥ khalaḥ krūraḥ.// But Cāṇakya Paṇḍita said, "This man snake is more dangerous than the animal snake." //Sarpāt krūrataraḥ khalaḥ.// Why? Now, //mantrauśādhi-vaṣaḥ sarpaḥ khalaḥ kena nivāryate:// "You can subdue the snake by chanting a snake //mantra// or some drug, //jadi-bhuti//[?], but this man snake cannot be subdued." It is very, very dangerous.

So this is our position, and therefore a preacher devotee is so, I mean to say, favorite to Kṛṣṇa. They have to meet actually dangerous persons, //krūraḥ// persons. Just see. Jesus Christ, what fault he had? He was preaching about God, and he was crucified. Crucified. That is in your country a very good example. Simply his fault was he was talking of God, that's all, and he was crucified. So we have to meet. Our Nityānanda Prabhu, He also met that Jagāi-Mādhāi. Of course, He delivered them. Nityānanda Prabhu is so kind that in spite of being stroken and blood came out from His head, still, He continued to say, "My dear friends, never mind you have injured Me. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." So the preaching is so difficult thing. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścid me priya kṛttamaḥ.// It is not very sitting idly, comfortably, and discuss //Vedānta.// No. It is not like that. Preaching practically. Practically meeting dangerous position because sympathetic. //Saṁsāra dāvānala.// The whole world is in blazing fire. //Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// Vaiṣṇava is //para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.// And that is his qualification. For him there is no difficulty. He's quite all right. He's under the protection of Kṛṣṇa. //Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati// [[books:bg:9:31|[Bg. 9.31]]]. So he has no danger personally. What danger there is? There is Kṛṣṇa. He is confident, and Kṛṣṇa protects him in all danger. But he is unhappy. He meets Jagāi-Mādhāi class and faces all kinds of danger. Therefore he is the powerful, authorized agent of Kṛṣṇa.

Thank you very much.
