====== Evening Darśana ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...there will be proper rainfall. And if there is proper rainfall, then you get sufficient food grains; not only food grains, other things also. //Sarva-dughā mahī, sarva-kāma-dughā mahī// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. From the earth you can get all the necessities of life. Actually you are getting food grains, minerals, trees, fruits, flowers, everything from the earth. //Sarva-dughā, sarva-kāma-dughā mahī.// This //mahī,// when it is soaked with proper rains, it becomes fertile. Therefore we have to depend on the rainfall. There is one verse in //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, kāmaṁ vavarṣa parjanyaḥ// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. //Parjanya// means rainfall. Rainfall means it is supplying all the necessities of life. And this rainfall will be easy when there is //yajña.// And nobody is performing //yajña;// therefore nowadays rainfall is scarcity. In Europe recently I have seen, there is no rainfall, whole Europe. It is on the verge of drying everything. So this punishment will come in this Kali-yuga. There will be no rainfall, and there will be not sufficient food supply, and the government will simply levy taxes on different pleas, and people will be so much embarrassed that they will give up their hearth and home and flee away to the forest. It is stated. So therefore you must perform //yajña.// And that is very easy in this age. //Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. You cannot perform the former //yajñasa// by sacrifice tons of ghee and grains because you have no sufficient food grains even. But still, if you chant this //saṅkīrtana,// that is //yajña.// Therefore you must take to //saṅkīrtana-yajña. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ.// It is very easy.

[break] ...the duty of human being, //prāṇaiḥ,// with life; //arthaiḥ,// with money; //dhiyā,// with intelligence; and //vācā,// by words. If one sacrifices his life for Kṛṣṇa's cause, then it is first-class. If he cannot sacrifice his life for Kṛṣṇa he can contribute his hard-earned money for Kṛṣṇa. If he cannot do so---if he has no money---he can give some intelligence. If he is not intelligent, then he can give some words. Just like we are doing preaching. We are preaching, //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. So without any jugglery of words we present to the people that "Here is Bhagavān," //kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.// So giving some words, sacrificing some words. Not that every one of us is very highly educated or very rich. Still, if we carry the words of Kṛṣṇa... As Kṛṣṇa says, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]], so we have to carry these words, that "The Supreme Personality of Godhead is Kṛṣṇa." Where is the difficulty? It is authorized. Kṛṣṇa says, and we simply carry the words. So where is difficulty? So simply by carrying these words that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. He wants that you surrender unto Him."

So any child can carry these words. Any foolish man can carry these words. And if you do that, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, then you become //guru,// simply by carrying these words. //Āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa// [[books:cc:madhya:7:128|[Cc. Madhya 7.128]]]. Even in your village, in your home, you can say to your wife, to your children. They will accept you, that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead." Then you become //guru// at home. Where is the difficulty? Is there any difficulty? But people will not do that. This truth they will not say. What is the reason? Say what is the reason why they do not carry this message, simply to say everyone, whomever you meet. You are meeting daily with your wife, your children, your friends. If you simply do this missionary work and say that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality," then you become a great devotee. You become a //guru.// Why people do not do so? It is not very difficult task. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. He said that "By My order you become a //guru.//" Indians especially are advised to become //guru// because Indians, however fallen they may be, they still have respect for Kṛṣṇa. Every home, they perform Kṛṣṇa's Janmāṣṭamī.

So therefore Indians are fortunate. They recognize Kṛṣṇa. Now, to become little more advanced, let them act as Kṛṣṇa's servant. Kṛṣṇa came to speak this truth, that "I am the Supreme." //Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]. //Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. He appeared to speak this philosophy. And if you do the same work, that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead," then you are serving the mission of Kṛṣṇa, great service to Kṛṣṇa. The words for which He appeared on this earth, if you simply carry these words door to door, village to village, man to man, then you become a //guru,// a real //guru.// Not to pose yourself a //guru// without any knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. That is cheating. And to accept and understand Kṛṣṇa the Supreme thoroughly and preach these words, that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead," is the supreme success of life. What is the difficulty? Is there any difficulty? Why don't you do that? I have to bring all these young men from Europe and America to speak to you this truth. Why our young men is not coming to speak this truth? Hmm? What is the difficulty? That means willfully they are denying the success of life. Willfully. Then what can be done? If somebody willfully commits suicide, who can save him? This is our position at the present moment. The Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura sings, //jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu:// "I have drunk poison knowingly." So if somebody knowingly drinks poison, then who can save him?

So we are doing that. Without preaching the gospel of Kṛṣṇa consciousness we are drinking poison willfully. This is our position.

> hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu
> manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,
> jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu

Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura regrets, "My Lord, I have lost or I have wasted my valuable life as human being by not accepting Kṛṣṇa consciousness. //Hari hari biphale janama goṅāinu, manuṣya-janama pāiyā:// "I got this opportunity of human life, but I could not worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Therefore voluntarily, willingly, I have drunk poison." //Jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu. Golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana, rati nā janmilo kene tāya:// "This transcendental Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra,// it is not ordinary vibration. This vibration is coming from the spiritual world, but I have no attraction."

Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Indian man:**
I talked to radio[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Oh, you have taken so much trouble. //Prasādam,// some give it to... //Jaya.// A very big block of farms. What is the name of that...? Eh?

**Indian men:**
Bechel[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
Bechel[?]. So we want so many men to live there nicely, to eat sumptuously, and preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I have seen while coming from Vṛndāvana to Delhi, hundreds and thousands of young men, they are going to the factories on cycle, coming from distant place, at least twenty miles, twenty-five miles, and it takes two hours to reach the factory, or more than that. And there he works hard eight hours and then again goes back, two hours, three hours, on cycle. I do not know what kind of rest he takes. This is life. And if we request these young men that "You come here. You live here comfortably. You eat here sumptuously and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," they will not. Just see how unfortunate they are. //Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:10|[SB 1.1.10]]]. This is Kali-yuga. All bad men, unfortunate and disturbed. This is the position. They will work so hard, they'll catch daily passenger trains, Calcutta, Bombay, I have seen. They are actually hanging, and some of them are falling down, lost life, and coming from hundred miles away. But still, if you ask him that "You come here. Live with us. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Even with your family you can come..." We are doing that at Māyāpur. He will not. How strong sense gratification propensity is. This is position of Kali-yuga. They are making propaganda, //roṭi kāpra makān// [food, clothing, shelter]. So we are giving, "Come on, //roṭi, makān, kāpra;// you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." "No. I want wine. I want meat. I want //rundi.//" This is going on. Simply they say, "//Roṭi, kāpra, makān.//" But no, they want wine, woman and sense pleasure, that's all. //Roṭi, kāpra, makān// is not difficult. You can get. But they want something more. You see how many advertisements for selling wine in your Hyderabad. Is that //roṭi, kāpra, makān?//

**Vāsughoṣa:**
Even the poorest of men. Just like before, when this temple wasn't here and we were chopping away at the rocks in the foundation, we were paying twenty rupees a day for those men. And we were told that ten rupees every day would go for wine for those same men. Ten rupees out of the twenty they would immediately spend to drink. Even poor people. So many of them.

**Prabhupāda:**
And because we are trying to stop this thing in Europe and America there is agitation, that "These people are propagating brainwash. How is that, a man who will not eat, drink? This is brainwash." Hmm. They'll spend ten rupees out of twenty rupees. Eh?

**Vāsughoṣa:**
Yes, we were told like that, that they would take their twenty rupees' pay and then they would go and spend ten rupees on alcohol, drinking, toddy. [break] I was in... Last time at the festival in Māyāpur I was riding from Māyāpur to Calcutta. And so one man was saying that "Oh, fish, 80 paisa a kg." "How much are potatoes?" I asked. So even their hard-earned money, so much more they spend just to eat meat, to enjoy their senses. It is not even... It doesn't make sense in any way.

**Prabhupāda:**
And that also, they cannot live on meat. They must have vegetable also. Without vegetable, simple meat-eating will not help them. [greets someone] Hare Kṛṣṇa. [Hindi] //Jaya.//

> piśācī pāile yena mati-cchana haya
> māyā-grasta jīvera se haya bhāva udaya

Just like a man, when he is haunted by a ghost, he speaks nonsense, he does nonsense. Similarly, when one is absorbed, overwhelmed by //māyā,// he speaks like that, he talks like that, he acts like that. [break] ...scientists manufacture? They are very proud of becoming scientists. Such nice flower, can anyone manufacture? And still, the rascal, they say there is no God. Hmm? What do you think? How do they say there is no God, these rascals? What is the reason?

**Vāsughoṣa:**
Actually, I think they are all misers.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Vāsughoṣa:**
They are also misers. They want to enjoy.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, misers, I say rascals, fools and rascals. That's all. That is their real position, //mūḍha. Mūḍha.// This very word is used in the //Bhagavad-gītā, mūḍha. Mūḍha// means rascal, ass. Asses. Anyone who denies the existence of God, he is //mūḍha,// ass. He is not human being. If you are intelligent enough, by seeing this flower you must admit there is God. //Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.// Find out this verse. //Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam:// "//Mūḍha,// rascals, they cannot understand that I am behind everything." [to boy] Come here. Who has manufactured this flower?

**Boy:**
God.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good. [laughter] Thank you. He is intelligent. And the rascal will say, "There is no God." //Mūḍhaḥ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.// [Hindi] That's all right. What is that verse? I am very pleased that he has immediately answered the right thing. This is intelligence.

**Devotee (1):**
Is this the one? //Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]]?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, it is... Which chapter it is?

**Devotee (1):**
Seventh.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Read the verse whole.

**Devotee (1):**
//Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti...// [[books:bg:7:25|[Bg. 7.25]]].

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mām ebhyaḥ.// Yes, read that.

**Tejiyas:**
"I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My..."

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, here is intelligence. This boy has got intelligence; therefore he can see, behind this flower there is God. He immediately answered. That is intelligence. He is not seeing God, but he's seeing God. God is not present face to face, but it doesn't matter. Just like the prime minister of our country, she may not be present here, but that does not mean that she is not there. She is there. So these rascals say, "Can you show me God?" How can you see Him? By intelligence. Just like this fan is running. The powerhouse is not here, but intelligent man will understand that there is electric powerhouse from where the electricity energy is supplied, and therefore the fan is running. By the running of the fan, one can understand that there is a big powerhouse and there is an electric engineer there who is conducting the business. That is sufficient, to see the running of the fan. That is intelligence. And if somebody says, "No, no, the fan is running automatically," that is not possible. You are experiencing every moment: as soon as the electric energy is stopped, the fan is stopped. The room is dark. So there is powerhouse behind this electric energy, and the powerhouse is being managed by one engineer. This is natural conclusion. And Kṛṣṇa says, //mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:// "Under My supervision the material nature is working." Find out this verse.

"This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again."

**Prabhupāda:**
Purport?

**Tejiyas:**
"It is clearly stated here that the Supreme Lord, although aloof from all the activities of the material world, remains the supreme director. The Supreme Lord is the supreme will and the background of this material manifestation."

**Prabhupāda:**
The modern scientists, their first business is to deny that Supreme. That is modern. It is a curse for the scientist if they talk of God. Amongst the scientists this is an etiquette, not to talk of God. Everything science. Means everything nonsense, passing on as scientist. Do you believe this?

**Devotee:**
Pardon me?

**Prabhupāda:**
The scientists' position denying God, do you think?

**Mahāṁśa:**
It's always changing now. They [indistinct].

**Vāsughoṣa:**
They feel great anxiety also to talk about God. Once, about three years ago, I had met one big scientist from University of Chicago. Just a chance there was one... My father had invited me back home for something; the scientist was there. We got in a big discussion with him and his daughter. They were just saying, "We don't see God. We have no... There is no evidence of God." Even logically we could show them. They still didn't want to accept. It was so obvious to them. Ultimately they couldn't say anything.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is their logic to deny God?

**Vāsughoṣa:**
It's not logic. They don't have any logic. And ultimately, if we present our conclusions of //Bhagavad-gītā// to them, they are silenced. They can't say anything. But they still refu... I mean, they don't accept it, but they can't deny it.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is dog's obstinacy. The dog, however you ask the dog to stop barking, it will go on barking. Dog's obstinacy. Hmm. [someone brings something?] What is that? I have taken.

**Tejiyas:**
"But in the management... But the management is being conducted by material nature. Kṛṣṇa also states in //Bhagavad-gītā// that of all the living entities in different forms and species, 'I am the father.' The father gives seeds to the womb of the mother for the child, and similarly the Supreme Lord by His mere glance injects all the living entities into the womb of material nature, and they come out in their different forms and species, according to their last desires and activities. All these living entities, although born under the glance of the Supreme Lord, still take their different bodies according to their past deeds and desires. So the Lord is not directly attached to this material creation. He simply glances over material nature; material nature is thus activated, and everything is created immediately. Because He glances over material nature, there is undoubtedly activity on the part of the Supreme Lord, but He has nothing to do with the manifestation of the material world directly. This example is given in the //smṛti:// when there is a fragrant flower before someone, the fragrance is touched by the smelling power of the person, yet the smelling and the flower are detached from one another. There is a similar connection between the material world and the Supreme Personality of Godhead; actually He has nothing to do with this material world, but He creates by His glance and ordains. In summary, material nature, without the superintendence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, cannot do anything. Yet the Supreme Personality is detached from all material activities." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
//...ārati?//

**Tejiyas:**
Seven.

**Prabhupāda:**
God is one. Others, they are... Just like president is one; others are government servant. Similarly, God is one. There cannot be other God. Then he is not God.

**Indian man (1):**
But Kṛṣṇa says in //Gītā, rudrāṇāṁ śaṅkaro 'smi.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Yes. //Rudrāṇāṁ śaṅkaro 'smi.// That means just like Śaṅkara has got some godly power.

**Indian man (1):**
Suppose if someone worships..., they are worshiper of Śiva.

**Prabhupāda:**
But that is not God worship. That is Śiva worship. Why do you bring God worship?

**Indian man (1):**
God, [indistinct] ...these are going directly to the Śiva.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Indian man (1):**
No, not directly.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can go to Lord Śiva. //Yānti deva-vratā devān// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]].

**Guest:**
//Mad-bhakta yājino...//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. //Mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām.// There is distinction. You purchase ticket for Delhi, you can go to Delhi. How you can go to Bombay?

**Indian man (1):**
But among the people there is a misconception.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then people are rascals. Therefore the //mūḍhas// they are. What value they have got? They have no value.

**Indian man (2):**
[indistinct Sanskrit]

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right. You can have respect for everyone. That is good. But it does not mean that by purchasing ticket for Delhi you go to Bombay. And it does not mean that because you do not go to Bombay you have no respect for Delhi. That is not. But if you want to go to Delhi, you have purchased a ticket for Delhi. If you want to go to Bombay you must purchase a ticket for Bombay. Why do you speak nonsensically that "Whatever ticket I purchase, I go to Bombay"? [laughter] This is nonsense. They'll take to this nonsense theory. That is Vivekananda's theory. "Whatever you do, it is all right." //Yato mata tato patha.// And that is not fact.

**Indian man (1):**
These are all paths lead to the Supreme.

**Prabhupāda:**
How? Kṛṣṇa says, //yānti deva-vratā devān// [[books:bg:9:25|[Bg. 9.25]]]. How, you nonsense, straightly say that everyone goes to God? This is nonsense. You can go to Śiva, you can go to Indra, you can go... There are so many planets, and you'll go there. And that is reasonable. And how do you say that "Whatever ticket I purchase, I go to this, Delhi?"

**Vāsughoṣa:**
They say that all..., they're all the same.

**Prabhupāda:**
"They say." Therefore they are nonsense, //mūḍha,// rascals. They do not know what is God, what is demigod, what is Lord Śiva, what is Lord Viṣṇu or Brahmā. They do not know. If a woman says, "Oh, everyone is my husband," then she is a prostitute. That's all. A chaste woman will say, "No, there is one, my husband. That's all." That is chaste woman. And if she is liberal, if she says, "No, no, everyone is my husband," that means she is prostitute. She does not know what is value of husband. In //Bhagavad-gītā// Kṛṣṇa says, //kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante anya devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]: "Those who have adhered to other demigods, they have lost their intelligence," //hṛta-jñānāḥ,// "rascals." They'll go. //Kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante anya devatāḥ. Antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām// [[books:bg:7:23|[Bg. 7.23]]]. Because they are rascals, they prefer like that. The public opinion will be taken; Kṛṣṇa's opinion will be... Public is rascals. They can say all nonsense. That is not to be taken. You have to take---that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement---what Kṛṣṇa says. What do you think? Kṛṣṇa says, //kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante anya devatāḥ.//

**Indian man (1):**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? But one man in Bangalore was talking. He was saying that everything there goes to Govinda, even [indistinct] in the //Bhagavad-gītā// [indistinct]. Because so many people following, they are also following.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So public opinion dictates that "This property is ours." Will he give by votes? Why he'll protest on that point?

**Indian man (1):**
His point is that because everyone is telling Kṛṣṇa is Supreme, therefore you are also supreme, but what the proof that Kṛṣṇa is Supreme? Everyone is calling as...

**Prabhupāda:**
So we have to meet such rascals and we have to preach. The world is full of rascals, //mūḍha.// What can be done? But we cannot change our preaching because the rascals are many. That is not... We cannot make that...

**Indian man (1):**
There is no medicine for //mūḍhas.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. There is medicine: there is beating with shoes. That is medicine. //Mūrkhasya laktausadhiḥ,//[?] //argumentum baculum.// You cannot mildly speak to the animals, "My dear cow, my dear dog, please do not bark. Do not go this way." No, you require //lāṭhi,// stick, and they will behave. Can you stop dog's barking by simply request? But you take the stick and beat it, and he will stop. //Mūrkhasya laktausadhiḥ.//[?] So there is no king. There is no //kṣatriya.// Therefore these rascals are talking all nonsense. There is no //śāsana.// This is king's duty, to see that they are acting according to //śāstra.// But there is no such king. So everyone is acting whimsically, whatever he likes, and the so-called //svāmīs// are preaching, "No, no, whatever you like, that's all right. You can eat whatever you like. You can do whatever you like. You think yourself that you are God, that's all right." This is going on. By thinking himself that he's God, he becomes God. This is going on, so many meditations: "I am moving the sun, I am moving the moon, I am moving... //mo-mo-mo-mo.//" [laughter] And rascals are following them.

**Indian man (1):**
They do not know the process of God.

**Prabhupāda:**
I know. There is no question of individual. I know these rascals. God is so easy thing that simply by I am thinking that "I am moving the sun, I am moving the..., //mo-mo-mo-mo,//" he'll... Because the whole world is //mūḍha,// we cannot say that "Yes, I am also with you. I am also one of the //mūḍha.//" We cannot say. The votes may be against us, but we cannot agree to that. We simply speak for Kṛṣṇa's sake. That is Kṛṣṇa. We cannot make any compromise. What do they say about this version in the //Bhagavad-gītā, kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante anya devatāḥ// [[books:bg:7:20|[Bg. 7.20]]]? What do they say? What is their opinion? But don't say, "Somebody said..." Everyone is fool, rascal. What is the value of their words?

**Indian man (1):**
Or this one mission says, "You worship..., your is the //devatā.//" [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I know these rascals. Therefore the country's position is the godless India. They lost their culture.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
They had big propaganda that Sai Baba is God also. He was saying in the... These professors challenged him, so he said, "How can an ant try and understand an ocean?" He made that statement, that the Professor at Bangalore University, Vice Chancellor said that, you know, so many... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Does that mean we have to accept him? That does not mean we have to accept. [break] ...one is against this movement because we are presenting Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme. [break]

**Indian man (1):**
...I was talking to him, according to him, he said only [indistinct]. We don't call it anything, but we want to. But all the [indistinct].

**Prabhupāda:**
That means prostitute. "Everyone is my husband." Prostitution. That's all. [break] ...does not know what is duty. Duty is //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is duty. Kṛṣṇa never said that "Everything is all right." He says, //sarva-dharmān parityajya:// "Simply surrender unto Me." That is duty. They do not know what is duty. And he's manufacturing his duty. That is not duty. Duty is that which is ordered by the superior authorities: "You do this." So if he does that, that is discharge of duty. And if he manufactures his duty, that is not duty. That is concoction. So they are manufacturing duty. That is not duty. If the child manufactures a duty that "I shall play all day. This is my duty," will the parents accept it?

**Indian man (1):**
Under... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
No. But if he knows? But he does not know. That is the difficulty. That I was explaining, //mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam. Mūḍho nābhijānāti.// He does not know what is duty because he's a //mūḍha.// If you say, "If he knows," but "If he knows" means it is difficult to know what is duty. The //mūḍhas,// they cannot know what is duty. Therefore Kṛṣṇa personally says, "This is duty: //sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam// [[books:bg:18:66|[Bg. 18.66]]]. This is duty."

**Devotee:**
Also the //paramahaṁsas// never speak, they say.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Paramahaṁsa// may speak all nonsense, but Kṛṣṇa is accepted by all the //ācāryas//---Madhvācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Nimbārka, Caitanya. They are important men. //Evaṁ paramparā prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ// [[books:bg:4:2|[Bg. 4.2]]]. So we have to give up the instruction of //ācārya// and accept some rascal? That we cannot do. //Ācāryopāsanam.// In //Bhagavad-gītā// it is recommended that you should worship the //ācārya,// not these rascals who talks all nonsense. Then we'll make progress. //Ācāryopāsanam.// Is it not? //Ācāryopāsanam// is there. And still in India the //ācārya's paramparā// system existing, //sampradāya.// Rāmānuja-sampradāya, Madhvācārya-sampradāya, Nimbārka, going on. [Hindi] [end]
