They are dangerous road.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
The roads are not very good.

He's collecting to get the bus fixed. [break] Another one, a small one. [break] The day Your Divine Grace... [break] ...so much danger with these machines. Not a... [break] Motorcycle... [break] [indistinct fragments]

It's very old. [break] Many Arabs are here in Hyderabad.

They have so much money, but they only have a desert, so they have to come to India to try and enjoy. There's nothing to enjoy in Arabia, simply sand.

Arabians come here, I know.

In Bombay also, all the big hotels are filled with Arabians.

This Taj and Oberoi, so many are there.

India has good income from Arabian tourist.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
Even in Bahrain I met the brother of the ruler, and he said that he liked India the best of any place he had been. He had been all over the world.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's a fact.

**Vāsughoṣa:**
He said India was the best place. So I told him to stay in our hotel in Juhu next time he came. [break] [end]
