====== Room Conversation on Farm Management ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Make very nice, palatable //prasādam.// We shall spend for that. Why miserly? There is no need of miserly. You are going to earn money by agricultural produce, so how the money will be utilized? It will be utilized for Kṛṣṇa's purpose. By //prasādam,// by chanting, by drama, somehow or other bring them. That is our mission. Congregational chanting. Always festival, and we shall spend for that. Immediately arrange. If there is scarcity of money, I shall pay, but from... Bring them, somehow or other. Tomorrow I want to see at least 500 men. Make arrangement like that. I came here to see that, not to sit down in a room peacefully. So there also we shall inform the meeting that we want to propagate this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement town to town, village to village, by attracting them with musical demonstration of //saṅkīrtana,// dramatic play, movie, //prasādam.// Somehow or other they should come to the temple, to the //paṇḍāl,// and congregationally chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// hear //Bhagavad-gītā, Bhāgavatam.// For this purpose, whatever expenditure is required, that you should collect and spend. This is the scheme of Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. You must come here, question, understand, and vigorous propaganda should be inaugurated town to town, village to village. Those who are educated, to them distribution of literature. The school, college, library, institution, university, by scholarly presentation. That is wanted. What is that?

**Jagadīśa:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Doesn't matter. Understand the idea?

**Jagadīśa:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
To attract them to really nice //prasādam,// palatable food, we shall spend. And we shall earn also by literature, produce, as they're earning. Where is the difficulty? We shall take contribution from rich persons. We shall earn ourself, and spend it to give them very nice //prasādam.// Gradually when they come, when you engage them in producing their own food, own shelter, own cloth... This should be organized. And they'll be glad. As soon as they understand, they will be glad to do. And they will stop all this nonsense: illicit sex and meat-eating. Then their life will be purified, and they'll make more and more advancement in this path. That is perfection. That you want. Is it clear or not?

**Jagadīśa:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes? This is our mission. If you give them very nice, palatable //prasādam...// They go to hotel from miles together to take some palatable foodstuff---restaurant, hotel. And we cannot give nice //kṛṣṇa-prasādam?// Why? Why you cannot give? Arrange like that, first class. Simply for eating they will come. Immediately do it.

**Jagadīśa:**
I have a question, whether we should always give them //khicuṛi// or whether we should...

**Prabhupāda:**
Give them nice //prasādam// by which they are attracted. It doesn't matter //khicuṛi, purī, kachorī, lāḍu.// Whatever they are attracted, we must give.

Jagadīśa: //Halavā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever that will attract them. That I want. //Kṛṣṇa-prasādam.// Don't waste; give them nice, palatable foodstuff. Give them one finest //kachorī,// one nice //samosā,// two //purīs,// they will be very glad. Make very, very nice //prasādam.// What is this rubbish, the dog cannot eat even? They have done a great mistake, all rascals. I am very angry. I say that if you have no money, I'll spend, I will give you money. Why should you make such tenth class, and no food at all. It is to be thrown away. Simply waste of grains and energy. Engage nice professional cook, prepare nice foodstuff. I shall spend for that if you have no money. Gentlemen who are coming immediately should be offered some //prasādam:// "Please come here, take: //purī, kachorī, samosā.//" Arrangement should be like that. The doctors came, he comes out of love, but there is no //prasādam.// Huh? What is this?

**Jagadīśa:**
Sorry?

**Prabhupāda:**
The doctor comes, but we could not supply him //prasādam// at 12 o'clock.

**Jagadīśa:**
Today?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not today, the other day.

**Jagadīśa:**
Oh.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Prasādam// is not yet ready, you also said. After eating I have no..., not yet ready. What is this? At 2 o'clock? As soon as they want. The Vṛndāvana also, the same thing I told that. Now they are doing? //Prasādam,// as soon as they want, they'll must feed some //prasādam// according to the position of the person. We shall spend for that. I am not hesitating to spend money. Why the arrangement is lacking? Immediately arrange for theirs and invite them. Don't make it childish. Where are the leaders? They are now engaged there?

**Jagadīśa:**
Pardon me?

**Prabhupāda:**
Our leaders are engaged there?

**Jagadīśa:**
At the //kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh.

**Jagadīśa:**
Mahāṁśa is there. I don't know where Haṁsadūta is.

**Prabhupāda:**
So anyway, this is my instruction. We have written and discussed and go. And I want to see tomorrow many thousand people. If you cannot make attractive, why they will come? Then it is failure. Make attractive. Whatever money is required, I shall pay. Simply theory will not help. Make such //prasādam// as people will come and be mad after it.

**Jagadīśa:**
Yes, we can...

**Prabhupāda:**
Just explain. You have taken in writing?

**Jagadīśa:**
It's on tape.

**Prabhupāda:**
So go and discuss. They must be attracted.

**Jagadīśa:**
I see.

**Prabhupāda:**
Otherwise it is failure. [break]

**Mahāṁśa:**
...who came, but...

**Prabhupāda:**
You are satisfied today?

**Mahāṁśa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then?

**Mahāṁśa:**
No. The people also, there was no advertisement of today there would be a program.

**Prabhupāda:**
So whatever it is required, you do it.

**Mahāṁśa:**
So on tomorrow, I will do the advertisement and show them...

**Prabhupāda:**
Give them very, very first class //prasādam.//

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They will come for the tongue.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes. Today the //ḍāl// is... They liked it very spicy.

**Prabhupāda:**
That they like, I do not know what they like. But you prepare they should come and eat.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know what they like.

**Mahāṁśa:**
There is a lot of //sabjī// in the //ḍāl// also, today, and it's hot. They like it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Whatever it may be, whatever they like, the villagers, you prepare. If you have no money, I shall pay money.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Okay.

**Prabhupāda:**
But attract them. They will come here to eat: "Oh, very nice thing." That is wanted. I made this movement successful simply by Love Feast. They did not come to hear Hare Kṛṣṇa. They came for Love Feast. From very beginning, when I was in 26 Second Avenue, every Sunday I was giving nice foodstuff, at least 200 men. Daily at least more than fifteen, twenty. I was cooking myself. That is the beginning of my movement. The //cāpāṭis// with Kīrtanānanda, first of all he was taking one and two, then twelve. [laughter] There was another boy...

**Devotees:**
Stryādhīśa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Stryādhīśa. Twenty-two //cāpāṭis.// [laughter] "Stryādhīśa, can I give you?" "Yes." I gave him four. Finished. "Stryādhīśa, can I give you?" "Yes." [laughter] Very nice boy. He was eating twenty-two. One day there was no money, so he immediately went and came after some time with some money. "And where did you go?" The shoe booth. He polished shoes and brought some money. [laughs] [laughter] In this way, this was developed. Give them //prasādam,// nice //prasādam.// Any gentleman comes, immediately there must be some //prasādam.// Engage first-class cook. Spend money; don't be a miserly. If you have no money, I will pay. So long I am living, I shall go on paying. You don't be miserly. Bring devotees for eating and then chanting, then cinema, then lecture. In this way you have to develop. Not that people will come, "Hare Kṛṣṇa //mantra// is there, let us go there." They will not come. What do they know about Hare Kṛṣṇa? They will come, "Oh, there is nice, good //prasādam// distributed."

**Mahāṁśa:**
Some people I know, they said that yesterday the //prasādam// was not nice, and there was...

**Prabhupāda:**
Not nice---it is not eatable even by the dogs! But you are less than the dogs if you prepare such thing. I was surprised. You allowed a sweeper to cook. I was surprised. We have distribution //prasādam,// not dog's food. Such rascals are here. You do not know. I do not wish to discuss anymore on this point. You have murdered the whole thing in two days. Now if possible, bring them, give them first-class //prasādam,// very palatable. Foodstuff means even one has no appetite, he'll eat. That is food. Not that even one has got appetite, he'll forget. That is not food. So do like that, and for money produce, use cane, sugarcane, rice. We shall spend for that. Don't spoil money, but do like businessman. He invests money, he gets a return. Spend it for Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. There is no question of becoming a miser. I never did it. When I have got a farthing, I want to spend it, immediately spend. Oh, what I have made this BBT? Immediately fifty percent for printing and fifty percent for spreading this. Why don't you understand what I want to do? So whatever is done is done; now do it very nicely. I want to see at least 1,000 men coming from the villages. There are 20,000 men here. You cannot attract them?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Can we announce that you will give //darśana// on the stage for five minutes?

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Can we announce...?

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody will come for my //darśana,// but if you want, I'll go.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is not very difficult task.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Because they are all very anxious to see you, because they've all been...

**Prabhupāda:**
All right, I shall go. What is that? The difficulty is I would have gone very gladly, but they do not understand my language, neither Hindi nor English.

**Mahāṁśa:**
It can be translated in Telugu.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then I shall go. I shall go.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
I shall go. I shall speak. Give them very nice food. From tomorrow I will... If there are rascals, you bring. I will pay nice cook. Make varieties, very palatable food. //Kichranna//[?], //puṣpānna,// rice, there are so many preparations. //Paramānna.// You do not make //paramānna, kichranna//[?], //puṣpānna.// There are varieties of rice preparation. They know, the southern people, with curd, yogurt...

**Mahāṁśa:**
Tamarind.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? Tamarind, so many preparations. So make like that. Why dog eating? They are not dogs. You cannot expect, because you are giving some dog-eatable food, they will come. There must be one first-class cook, and all our men should learn. There's no need of simply keeping unduly: "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa," and sleeping. We don't want such men. Make a show. And do not know anything how to preach. Useless. The householder, the women should be engaged in cooking. Their children should be gathered together. One man... I have said many times, all the children should be taken in a room by one woman, and others should be engaged in the cooking department. I have seen it. Your country, America, when they go to church, all the childrens are gathered together in a room. Is it not?

**Devotees:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And one or two men take care. And others, they go. Similarly, children they must have, so... Not that everyone is children busy, "I cannot do." They cannot do if they are busy with children. So what is the use of keeping such householders? Let them live outside, earn their money. Woman business is to cleanse, to cut the vegetables, to cook. What is this? They're simply busy with the children? And they have started their mission for maintaining some children and useless women. You should organize. //Rādhikāra pakka anna vividha byañjana.// All the //gopīs,// they are engaged for cooking for Kṛṣṇa. Mother Yaśodā will call them, "You young girls, you can cook very nicely."

> rādhikāra pakka anna vividha byañjana
> parama ānande kṛṣṇa korena bhojana

Do you understand Bengali?

**Mahāṁśa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rādhikā with Her friends, they are cooking. And they cook so nicely that //parama ānande kṛṣṇa korena bhojana:// with great pleasure Kṛṣṇa is eating. And that we have to distribute. Not dog's food. You do not know what is the purpose of this mission. Don't do it. Here is a good chance; don't spoil it. Produce huge. Make profit. You spend for Kṛṣṇa. Train all devotees how to cook. All women. Don't distribute dog's eatable things. //Kṛṣṇa-prasādam.//

> rādhikāra pakka anna vividha byañjana
> parama ānande kṛṣṇa korena bhojana
> [Gītāvalī]

Kṛṣṇa is taking with great pleasure. That //prasādam// you have to distribute. Not that dog is rejecting and you have to distribute that //prasādam.// Why do you think like that? This //prasādam,// this so-called, rubbish thing which is rejected by dog, and you are offering to the human being. You do it. If you have no money I shall pay. There is no question of scarcity of money. Don't spoil money, but spend for real purpose, that's all. And you arrange for huge agricultural. Whatever is required, water, we shall arrange for that. Labor, everything. And if you perform //yajña,// there will be rain. Anyway, I asked you the other day to fill up the tank. What is the difficulty?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Which tank?

**Prabhupāda:**
That big tank. Well. Big well.

**Devotee (1):**
Just here. The one that's been pumped empty. Anyway, the big empty one that we...

**Prabhupāda:**
But you were surprised. You do not know that we have got a big well here?

**Mahāṁśa:**
The one that we drink water from?

**Hari-śauri:**
The big square one.

**Devotee:**
Behind the house.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why it is empty? Hmm?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Fill it for what, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Why the well is empty? There is no water. He's surprised, as if dropping from the sky. You do not know that well?

**Mahāṁśa:**
It's just a tank.

**Prabhupāda:**
Tank, yes. Why it is empty?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Because I didn't know what purpose it will serve by filling it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Filling it, we shall pump and distribute water. You shall fit pipes, and pump water and distribute to the field, so there will be no scarcity of water, and produce. What it was meant, you do not know?

**Mahāṁśa:**
No, right now, that field does not need water to...

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why you are not growing there something?

**Mahāṁśa:**
The paddy is drying over there, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Mahāṁśa:**
The paddy, the rice, is drying.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no, there are so many other fields. Why they are empty?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Oh, we have to go and do boring wells and...

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore that means water supply.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes, that's what I have to arrange now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hah. So why...? When you will arrange? Arrange it immediately.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes, before...

**Prabhupāda:**
And that is also one of the water pool to solve water problem, the tank. Do you follow what I say?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You fill up the tank, and by pumping through pipe, you distribute water.

**Jagadīśa:**
The viaducts are already there, troughs.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
If we have got water filled up in that tank, we can water so many lands. We shall spend for that. We shall... Pipe line, pumping. If you have so much land we can produce gold[?]. But you have no brain. Produce gold[?], get money and spend it for Kṛṣṇa. This is wanted. Not simply planning and talking. The world is suffering for want of right planning. Otherwise, there is no question of suffering. //Pūrṇam idam,// complete it is, everything complete. That is the Vedic version. Why it is incomplete? Incomplete means these rascals. Supplying the necessities of life. [break] //Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān// [//Kaṭha Upaniṣad// 2.2.13]. Kṛṣṇa does not want to see that we are starving for want of food. That He does not want to see. But because you have come to the material world, you have to work hard. Then you'll get your food. That is the material world. //Śarīra-yātrāpi ca te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ// [[books:bg:3:8|[Bg. 3.8]]], Kṛṣṇa says. Very... If you do not work, then you cannot get food. Simply work together. //Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī// [[books:sb:1:10:4|[SB 1.10.4]]]. And you get from the land. You have got land. You get anything from the land. The land must be moist, then you get everything. That we want to show. Hmm? What do you think? Land is...

**Mahāṁśa:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Eh? You are intelligent, you... Eh?

**Harikeśa:**
You are the intelligent one, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now, what do you think this idea?

**Harikeśa:**
No, it's wonderful.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, do that.

**Harikeśa:**
In Vṛndāvana I saw one bull, just goes around in the circle all day and makes the water come up on these little catchers. And then it goes...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, so many means there are, watering.

**Harikeśa:**
The whole field.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. People have lost the program. These rascals, they draw all these men to manufacture Goodyear tire and eat stone[?]. This is going on. Modern man, they draw all these man, "Come on, I shall pay you 20 rupees daily. Prepare Goodyear tire, and eat stone. Take paper. Purchase stone. That's all. This is going on. What brain they will have? Twenty rupees they get, and they spend ten rupees for wine and five rupees for cigarette, and fooding, say five rupees. No //ghee,// no milk. Soul-killing civilization. And against this soul-killing civilization, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Hmm, what you wanted to say?

**Devotee:**
This..., your Dr. Ghosh, where he is staying...

**Prabhupāda:**
Mm.

**Devotee:**
We were there this afternoon for a program, and all their land is so green, and they are growing vegetables by a patch no bigger than this mattress that you are sitting. They are working one, planting, then growing another. Just a small piece, then planting.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
They have some way for the water to go to...

**Prabhupāda:**
You should do like that here, in our land. Do like that. If they can do here, some few miles away...

**Harikeśa:**
We can do.

**Prabhupāda:**
...you can do it. Do it immediately. See how they are doing. So much land, why it should remain vacant? So combinedly immediately begin. Hmm? So how long you are staying here?

**Harikeśa:**
Till Sunday morning.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So your business is complete or...

**Harikeśa:**
No, almost.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, give him all help.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes, people are...

**Prabhupāda:**
He is doing very nice there, and he'll do very nice.

**Haṁsadūta:**
One thing I thought it would be good if Your Divine Grace would write a letter making him the GBC, so that he can act with full authority.

**Prabhupāda:**
I'll give full authority. Write letter; I shall sign. Yes. You have full authority. Write letter, I'll sign.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes.

**Harikeśa:**
By your talking, I'm also thinking we should have a farm in Germany. I know...

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. Why not? Everywhere. I myself, when I go to the farm, I forget whether it is India or Germany or France. I forget. The land is there. //Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī.// We get everything from that. I have several times said that why they make this distinction, "This is France," "This is India," "This is..."? Everywhere the God's land. Why these rascals make division, I do not understand. Every land belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and you are sons of Kṛṣṇa. Let us live peacefully and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. All rascals, //mūḍha.// There is rain now and then fall in Europe?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes, now it's very much.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Now it's too late.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Now it's too late.

**Harikeśa:**
I mean, it wasn't there, but now it's so much.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. But God is giving hint, that if "Rascal, it is in My hand. I can keep you in starvation to death." The man is dull brain. Anyway, I am anxious to learn why so many people are suffering. They have become all gray. Throughout whole France I saw. From Paris to Valencay I went. Gray. These people are not lazy, but there was no water. They utilize every inch land for agricultural purpose. At least I saw in France. Then maybe everywhere in Europe. They are not lazy fellow. There is organization, government organization, here. People, they... Anyway, let us show some example. Immediately make program. You have seen, yes?

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And you are expert. Do it immediately. If there is requires some money, we shall pay. Fill up. What is the difficulty in filling up this tank?

**Mahāṁśa:**
I'm not still understanding which tank you are... Because there are many tanks...

**Devotees:**
[indistinct---all speak at once]

**Harikeśa:**
...it's empty.

**Mahāṁśa:**
No one ever swim in here. We took out water to water the fields.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why it is empty? Have it filled up.

**Mahāṁśa:**
How to fill? It has to come by itself. The water comes from the recuperation from the soil, so it is not in our hands to fill it. It just comes by itself slowly. It takes six days. If we empty the well it takes takes six days to fill it.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. By the... By digging a well or something you cannot...

**Mahāṁśa:**
If we do a boring, then that's..., the well can be filled. We have a pump and we can fill it. But now, as it is, it's fifty feet deep.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why not make boring?

**Mahāṁśa:**
That is my plan. That is what I was telling...

**Prabhupāda:**
Why plan? Why do it now?

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes. Now...

**Prabhupāda:**
Keep it always filled up.

**Harikeśa:**
He's saying he has the money.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes, I was thinking before you go, we should get the rigs coming here and putting on the whole...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Devotee (3):**
Tomorrow we should go to that place.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Yes.

**Devotee (3):**
It's the first business. We should go to that place and have him come, start the pool.

**Prabhupāda:**
Water required. Fill up with water and distribute water and produce, huge quantity, whatever can be produced. Sugarcane, rice, these are very valuable commodity at the present moment. Produce. And sugarcane means the upper portion will be the food for the cow.

**Mahāṁśa:**
Even rice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Even... Oh, yes. Very, very practic... We want some, same, food. //Annād bhavanti bhūtāni// [[books:bg:3:14|[Bg. 3.14]]]. //Bhūtāni// means both animal and men. Animals should be well fed. Not only human being, but animal also. Otherwise, how he'll work? Don't use tractor. Use this bulls. Otherwise there will be a problem, how to engage the bulls.

**Devotee:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Engage them for transport, for plowing.

**Mahāṁśa:**
We should not get a tractor?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. When you have got bulls, why should you get...?

**Mahāṁśa:**
We have only 8 pairs of bulls.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, and other bulls have been eaten up. Now we stop that eating. No, if you need, you can purchase tractor. But as far as possible try to avoid, and engage the bulls. Otherwise it will be problems. The Europeans have invented tractors, and the bull is a problem. Therefore they must be sent to the slaughterhouse. So we can not create that problem. How the bull should be utilized? They should be used for transport and plowing.

[background noise] What is this turmoil?

**Haṁsadūta:**
I think they are distributing //prasādam.//

**Mahāṁśa:**
Now they have finished the slide-show, and they are sitting down for //prasādam.//

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. Go and see it is done nicely. Announce that "Tomorrow we shall prepare such and such nice preparations. Please, you are especially invited." In this way attract. [end]
