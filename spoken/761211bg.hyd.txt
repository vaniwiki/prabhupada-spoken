====== Bhagavad-gītā 7.6 ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Give me this spectacle.

[chants verse, devotees repeating]

> etad yonīni bhūtāni
> sarvāṇīty upadhāraya
> ahaṁ kṛtsnasya jagataḥ
> prabhavaḥ pralayas tathā
> [[books:bg:7:6|[Bg. 7.6]]]

"Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit..."

**Devotees:**
"Everything that exists is a product of matter and spirit."

**Prabhupāda:**
You do not require to repeat. //Etad yonīni,// the different forms of life... Just like here we are, human being, the cows, the dogs, the ants, the trees, the plants---so many different forms of life. Every one of us, we are living being. But according to our //karma// we have got different bodies. Just like we have got different dresses. We are all human being, but we have got different dresses. Similarly, //sarvāṇi bhūtāni,// all living entities, they are all Kṛṣṇa's part and parcel, but they have refused to cooperate with Kṛṣṇa. They wanted to enjoy material life independently.

Therefore different forms of bodies are there, but Kṛṣṇa is the cause. Kṛṣṇa... Just like father. Father is the cause of the sons, but the sons may be different. Not exactly all the sons are on the equal pattern. Similarly, we are originally all part and parcel or sons of God. Therefore God's qualities are there in us, very minute quantities, because we are very small. So the quality is there. Just like drop of water from the oceans, the taste it is there. The taste of the ocean, salty, is there in the drop of ocean water. There is no difference. Only the difference is quantity. In quality they are one. Quality, that salty taste, quality, that is one. Any drop of the ocean, you can take the salty taste, but the drops may be of different quantity and the ocean is very, very big. This is called //acintya-bhedābheda,// simultaneously one and different. One in quality.

So qualitatively we are one. God is good, so in quality we are good; we are not bad. But why you have become bad? Because we are now differently dressed. //Dehātma-buddhiḥ.// A dog is thinking, "I am dog," and a man is thinking, "I am man." A cat is thinking, "I am cat." He is neither cat, neither dog, neither human being. He is part and parcel of God. //Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.// This is self-realization: "I am not this body." Just like we are differently dressed. So I am not the dress. I am human being; you are human being. //Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ// [[books:bg:5:18|[Bg. 5.18]]]. Therefore those who are learned scholar, they do not find any difference between cat and a //brāhmaṇa,// because the //brāhmaṇa// is also a living entity and the cat is also a living entity, differently dressed.

So we have to rectify this mistake, that "We are not this body. This is our external covering. We are spirit soul, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa." And that is the stage of liberation. //Svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ// [[books:sb:2:10:6|[SB 2.10.6]]]. Now we are acting according to the covering. When we shall not act according to the covering but according to our constitutional position, that is liberated platform. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means when we understand that "We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore our duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa," this is self-realization; this is liberation. When we are fully convinced about this fact that "We are all part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Our only duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa," then you are liberated. So the //bhakti// science means to purify. //Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam// [[books:cc:antya:20:12|[Cc. Antya 20.12]]]. We are differently conscious. Somebody thinking, "I am American," somebody, "I am Indian." This is not our identification. The identification, when I shall think, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu gives us information, //jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa// [[books:cc:madhya:20:108-109|[Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]]], that is self-realization.

So Kṛṣṇa says,

> etad yonīni bhūtāni
> sarvāṇīty upadhāraya
> ahaṁ kṛtsnasya jagataḥ
> prabhavaḥ pralayas tathā
> [[books:bg:7:6|[Bg. 7.6]]]

So "They are caused by Me," Kṛṣṇa says. The body... Body is the material---earth, water, air, fire and ether, mind, intelligence, ego. They are also emanating from Kṛṣṇa. //Prakṛti..., bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā.// The difference is they are not in touch with Kṛṣṇa. But it is Kṛṣṇa's energy. Just like I am speaking and it is being recorded. When it will be replayed, you will find that I am speaking, but that speaking is separated. The speaking has come from me, but in the tape record it appears that it is separated. Or it is separated. In one sense it is not separated, because originally comes from me, and another sense, it is mechanical going on. So similarly, this material world is also Kṛṣṇa. //Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ// [[books:sb:1:5:20|[SB 1.5.20]]]. This material world is emanating from Kṛṣṇa. //Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ// [[books:bg:10:8|[Bg. 10.8]]]: "I am the origin of everything." "Everything" means there are two things: one //jaḍa// and one //cetanā,// matter and spirit. There are two things. Matter is coming from Kṛṣṇa, and the spirit is also coming from Kṛṣṇa. Therefore He is the original cause, //sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam.//

> īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ
> sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ
> anādir ādir govindaḥ
> sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam
> [Bs. 5.1]

He is the cause of matter and He's cause of spirit also. So //sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.// Everything is from Brahman. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Brahman. And //Vedānta-sūtra, janmādy asya yataḥ// [[books:sb:1:1:1|[SB 1.1.1]]]: "Everything is coming from Him." Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, //etad yonīni:// "Although this //yoni,// the different types of living entities, are there, eight million, four hundred...," //etad yonīni bhūtāni sarvāṇīty upadhāraya, ahaṁ kṛtsnasya// [[books:bg:7:6|[Bg. 7.6]]], "they are all caused by Me." //Ahaṁ kṛtsnasya. Kṛtsnasya// means "of everyone." "Their body is also Mine, and they are spirit soul. They are also Mine."

So everything is Kṛṣṇa's. So therefore this body, I am claiming, "It is my body." It is not my body. It is Kṛṣṇa's. Kṛṣṇa is giving you. Just like father gives the dress to the children. Actually the dress belongs to the father. So when we understand this body is also Kṛṣṇa's energy, I am also Kṛṣṇa's energy, my intelligence is Kṛṣṇa's energy, and my identification is also with Kṛṣṇa, in this way when we realize fully, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And when Kṛṣṇa withdraws, then it is finished. This Kṛṣṇa, when He withdraws the spirit soul from the body, then the body remains, and in due course of times the body becomes... "Dust thou art, dust thou beist." This is mixed up, //pañca. Pañca-tattva prāpta.// Again the body is mixed up. Just like from the earth you make so many different types of forms. Again, when it is broken, it falls down on the earth, and in due course it becomes earth again.

So this change is going on of the external body, not of the spirit soul. The spirit soul is individual, Kṛṣṇa is individual, and it continues. Every one of us, we were individual in the past, we are individual at the present moment, and we shall continue to be individual in future. But when we are covered by this material body, this individuality becomes differentiated. Otherwise, even though individual---we are spirit soul---we are one, spirit soul. And without any material contamination, our relationship is permanent. Kṛṣṇa is the origin, master, //prabhu,// and we are emanation from Kṛṣṇa, servants. So..., and this relationship continues. Then there is no impediment on account of this bodily covering. //Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate// [[books:cc:madhya:19:170|[Cc. Madhya 19.170]]]. When we are not contaminated by the body, we remain pure. With that senses, when we serve Kṛṣṇa, that is our liberation. That is called //bhakti.//

Thank you very much.
