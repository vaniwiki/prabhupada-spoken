====== Evening Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
[//prema-dhvani prayers//] All glories to the assembled devotees. All glories to the assembled devotees. Thank you very much.

**Hari-śauri:**
[indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Hari-śauri:**
Spectacles?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I can speak in three languages: English, Bengali and Hindi. But I cannot speak in Oriya. Now our Gaura-Govinda Mahārāja, he has agreed to translate into Oriya from English. So as you desire, I can speak either in English, Hindi or Bengali.

**Indian man:**
English.

**Prabhupāda:**
I shall speak in English. If I speak in English, then these foreigners, they will also understand, and it can be translated into Oriya. So? I shall speak in English? That's all right?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You say yes. [laughter] So of course, English is international language, and because we are speaking in English, publishing in English, it has been possible to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness throughout the whole world. [Bengali] [Gaura-Govinda translates throughout] So we have first of all presented //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// in English. Now it is being translated practically in all the languages of the world. Our //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// has been translated in all the European languages, namely French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, Swedish, in this way, in Europe. Whole America speaks in English. Whole Australia speaks in English. Besides that, in Asia, Chinese language and Japanese language, they have all translated.

So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for saving the whole human society. The present moment... Not in the present; in this material world always the attempt is to defy the supremacy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At the present moment the so-called scientists, their only business is how to defy the supremacy of God. Naturally our this movement has to face many impediments, because at the present moment the whole world is practically godless. Even in our country, in India, where //Bhagavad-gītā// was spoken by the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, even here also the same attempt is going on. Big, big scholars, big, big politicians, they take //Bhagavad-gītā// in their hand as if he is a great authority in //Bhagavad-gītā,// but they are presenting commentation just to defy Kṛṣṇa. So we take them according to //Bhagavad-gītā.// So Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa... //Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam// [[books:sb:1:3:28|[SB 1.3.28]]]. That is the verdict of the //śāstra,// and Kṛṣṇa personally, when He was present before us, He said, //mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya// [[books:bg:7:7|[Bg. 7.7]]]: "Nobody is greater authority than Me." In the //Vedānta-sūtra// it is said, //athāto brahma jijñāsā:// "Now this life, this human form of life, is meant for making inquiry about the Supreme." That Brahman, the Supreme... Brahman means //bṛhatvad bṛhannatvad,// the greatest, which includes everything. That is Brahman. Just like we are, we living entities, we are //brahma.// Because I am the spirit soul, I am within this body; therefore everything is complete. So in the //Bhagavad-gītā// this //brahma-jijñāsā,// "What is Brahman?" if you are inquisitive, the answer is in the very beginning of the //Bhagavad-gītā.//

So Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā,// giving the first instruction to Arjuna, //dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptir// [[books:bg:2:13|[Bg. 2.13]]]. The //brahma,// the spirit soul, the part and parcel of Para-brahman, is //dehi. Asmin dehe.// In this body he is the proprietor of the body. //Dehi// and //deha. Deha// means this body, and //dehi// means the proprietor of the body. So that //dehi,// or the proprietor of the body, is Brahman. //Brahma-jijñāsā.// If we are inquisitive to know about Brahman, first of all we must know that I or you---any spirit soul---is Brahman, and he's within this body. We are not the... Other words, we are not this body; we are within this body. This is //brahma-jñāna.// In another place also, the same thing has been affirmed in //Bhagavad-gītā: kṣetra kṣetrajñaḥ.// Arjuna inquired from Kṛṣṇa, "What is //kṣetra// and what is //kṣetrajña?//" That answer is given in the Thirteenth Chapter: //idaṁ śarīraṁ kṣetram ity abhidhīyate// [[books:bg:13:1-2|[Bg. 13.2]]]. It has been explained that this //kṣetra...// Just like we work in the field, the owner of the field and the field, similarly, this body is the field, and the owner, the //dehi,// I or you, we are working on this field, //kṣetrajña.// And Kṛṣṇa says also, //kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhisarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata// [[books:bg:13:3|[Bg. 13.3]]]. He... Because sometimes foolishly we think that we are also Bhagavān or equal to Bhagavān, //kṣetrajña,// so Kṛṣṇa says, "I am also //kṣetrajña,// but the difference is that //sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.//" [to Gaura-Govinda:] Now explain. Just like I am //kṣetrajña;// you are //kṣetrajña.// You know the pains and pleasure of your body; I know the pains and pleasure of my body. But either you or I do not know what is the pains and pleasure of your body, and you do not know what is the pains and pleasure of my body. So that is the difference between //ātmā// and Paramātmā. Kṛṣṇa is Paramātmā. //Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūteṣu hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati// [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]. That Paramātmā... I am also with Him. I am also living within the heart, and Kṛṣṇa is also living within the heart.

So there are two //ātmās,// namely //ātmā// and Paramātmā. This is explained in the //Upaniṣad,// that "There are two birds on one tree. This tree is this body, and the two birds, one is //ātmā// and the other is Paramātmā." So one bird is simply witnessing what the other bird is doing, and the other bird, //jīvātmā,// he is eating the fruit. So therefore Kṛṣṇa says in the //Bhagavad-gītā// that,

> īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ
> hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati
> bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni
> yantrārūḍhāni māyayā
> [[books:bg:18:61|[Bg. 18.61]]]

That //īśvara,// that Paramātmā, is sitting also within this body, but He's observing what the //jīvātmā// wants to do. According to that, He is supplying a machine. This machine means this body, //yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.// This machine is manufactured by the external energy, //māyā.// So therefore we are //jīvātmā;// we are different from the Paramātmā. Those who are equalizing Paramātmā and //jīvātmā,// they are not in perfect knowledge. Either purposefully they are misleading, or they do not know the perfect knowledge.

At the present moment this danger is there in a very large quantity. People are thinking wrongly that they are also God, as good as God. In the //Bhagavad-gītā// the statement is, Kṛṣṇa says, //mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ// [[books:bg:15:7|[Bg. 15.7]]]. //Jīva-bhūta// is the living entities. "They are My part and parcel." So it is an axiomatic truth: part is never equal to the whole. //Āṁśi.// So just like this finger is the part of my body, but it does not mean the finger is the whole body, therefore there is distinction between Brahman and Para-brahman, //īśvara// and Parameśvara, //ātmā// and Paramātmā. So //īśvara// means controller, one who controls; but Parameśvara means the controller of the controller. That is explained in the //Brahma-saṁhitā, īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ// [Bs. 5.1]. //Īśvara...// All of us may be //īśvara.// I am //īśvara// amongst my disciples. You may be //īśvara// amongst your family members. But none of us is Parameśvara.

So this mistaken knowledge is very much spread at the present moment. So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is specially meant for removing this misconception of understanding God and the //jīvas.// So our first principle is that we have to discard or disregard the persons who are very much anxious to establish that //īśvara// and Parameśvara, or the living entity and the Supreme Person, they are equal. We do not support this theory. It is said in the //śāstra, yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ...,//

> yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ
> brahma-rudrādi
> samatvenaiva vīkṣeta
> sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam
> [[books:cc:madhya:18:116|[Cc. Madhya 18.116]]]

Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, //nārāyaṇaṁ devam,// if we equalize Him even with such demigods, such big personalities like Brahmā and Śiva, then we become a //pāṣaṇḍī.//

> yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devaṁ
> brahma-rudrādi-daivataiḥ
> samatvenaiva vīkṣeta
> sa pāṣaṇḍī bhaved dhruvam

Anyone, what to speak of with ordinary person, even personalities, big, big personalities like Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, if one equalize Nārāyaṇa, then he is called a //pāṣaṇḍī.// Unfortunately, at the present moment a poor man has been equalized with Nārāyaṇa as //daridra-nārāyaṇa.// So why one should say //daridra-nārāyaṇa?// What is the reason? Nārāyaṇa is Lakṣmī-pati, the husband of the goddess of fortune. How He can become //daridra-nārāyaṇa?// And where is this word in the //śāstra, "daridra-nārāyaṇa"?// So in this way, people are being misled.

So we have to save ourself from this misconception of life. Then we can make progress in the matter of understanding what is God. Therefore we are presenting //Bhagavad-gītā// as it is, without any deviation, and people are appreciating. Our this //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is// is being accepted by big, big scholars and professors. We have got innumerable certificates, or their opinions, and it is being well received. And from monetary point of view also, you'll be surprised that we are selling millions of copies of //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.//

So we have come to your city to say something about //Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.// If respectable persons of this city will come and attend this meeting, I shall try to explain more and more so long I am present here. Now, if you have got any question on the subject matter I have spoken, you can make. I shall try to answer. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
So, there is no question I see. Thank you very much.

**Rāmeśvara:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Now //kīrtana.//

**Rāmeśvara:**
Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. [end]
