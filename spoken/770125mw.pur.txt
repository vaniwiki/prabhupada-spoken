====== Morning Walk ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//Sarpaḥ krūraḥ khalaḥ krūraḥ// [Cāṇakya Paṇḍita]. The two envious... [break] But this //sarpaḥ,// snake, can be charmed by herbs and //mantra,// but the man, envious, cannot be. Therefore he's more dangerous than the snake. //Khalaḥ kena nivāryate.//

**Gurukṛpa:**
Like that //Māyāvādī// last night.

**Prabhupāda:**
He was a rascal. [laughs] Neither //māyāvāda; suvidavādī[?],// opportunist.

**Hari-śauri:**
He's just a //mūḍha,// that man last night. [out of car] [break]

**Gargamuni:**
We can walk on the beach. It's a very smooth beach, the sand. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...I was jumping here. [laughter] 1920 or '21, I came. After my appearing in examination, B.A. test, I came here. By that time I was married. I was married in 1918. [break] Because jubilant, I was jumping. When the waves come, I was jumping; the waves passed. There was one guide, he taught me, //Bābuji, ei sakava//[?].

**Gargamuni:**
They wear those hats.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [break] ...'20, and it is 1977. How many years?

**Gurukṛpa:**
Fifty-seven years.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fifty-seven years after. [laughs] So the body has not changed? Where is that body? Now I am with stick. [laughter] Then I was jumping. Is not that? I am there; I remember. The body has changed. What is the difficulty to understand? I am the same person. How I am remembering all these things. But I have no... That body is now lost. //Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.// Why this simple philosophy these rascals cannot understand? I remember; I am not the second man. I am the same person, but I haven't got the same body. The whole world this simple philosophy cannot understand. Where is the difficulty they cannot understand?

> dehino 'smin yathā dehe
> kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā
> tathā dehāntara prāptir

Because they are not //dhīra. Dhīra// means sober. They're rascals. They cannot understand. But //dhīra tatra na muhyati,// those who are sober, they can understand immediately. So there is no education to make people sober and intelligent. All rascals, fools, rogues, thieves, that's all. Animals. What they will understand about spiritual life? Therefore Kṛṣṇa... After all, Kṛṣṇa is speaking. That this very word is used: //dhīras tatra na muhyati. Adhīra.// There are two classes of men, //dhīra// and //adhīra. Dhīra// means sober, and //adhīra// means restless. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He gave us something //dhīrādhīra. Kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau premāmṛtāmbho-nidhī dhīrādhīra.// What is next word?

**Gurukṛpa:**
//Dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ha. //Dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau.// The sober and the restless, both of them will take it. //Krsnotkīrtana-gāna-nartana.//

**Hari-śauri:**
Want to go this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice beach. So acquire this. Yes?

**Gargamuni:**
I'll see the D. M. [District Magistrate] this morning. There's still those other two plots...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gargamuni:**
...on the main road. I will show you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Gargamuni:**
And on the other side of Purī there's a big beach area I will show you.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau priya-karau.// [break]

**Gurukṛpa:**
This is much cleaner than down there where the tourist hotels are.

**Prabhupāda:**
The first plot is very pleasing. It is all right. And you'll have very grand. Make road to sea, down to sea. [break] Now mostly people are //adhīra.// Therefore they cannot understand. Where is that? Flagstaff? There is a house called Flagstaff. One can walk miles.

**Hari-śauri:**
Yes. It's a very big beach.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore tourists come here.

[break] [back in car]

Then gradually you can develop. [break] ...Bajoriya house and that land.

**Gargamuni:**
And that other...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is very nice. [break] If not, we can pay little.

**Hari-śauri:**
A house by the sea would be very healthy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Hari-śauri:**
It'd be a very nice place for you to stay.

**Gargamuni:**
It's already built. We can re-renovate it and make it very beautiful for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Take it.

**Gargamuni:**
And if we construct a temple there, it is just near the temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is very nice. [break] [end]
