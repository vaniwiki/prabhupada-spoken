**Prabhupāda:**
So these European and American Vaiṣṇavas, they're hankering after //jagannātha svāmī nayana pathagāmī bhavatu me.// Now it is through your intervention they may be able to see Jagannātha Swami. [chuckles] They are hankering like that, //jagannātha svāmī nayana pathagāmī bhavatu me.//

**Indian man:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Have some //prasāda.// [end]
