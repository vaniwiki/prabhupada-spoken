====== Room Conversation ======

**Satsvarūpa:**
So the men would not buy their lunch from the meat-eaters.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, that is not our scheme. Our scheme is that //pathyam auṣadha. Auṣadha// means medicine, and //pathya// means diet. So in order to cure him from these material desires we shall give him medicine, //hari-nāma,// and diet, //prasāda.// We have no such program, to make him vegetarian. That is not our program.

**Yugadharma:**
I had one more other scheme with Dhanañjaya dāsa from Vṛndāvana. Dhanañjaya is making with this Spanish devotee from Spain, making... I have just seen last week these beautiful, beautiful Gaura-Nitāi //mūrti,// these Gaura-Nitāi Deities that he is making. They are casting them in Vṛndāvana, and they are very, very beautiful. And Dhanañjaya has told me that you have encouraged him to sell //mūrtis// in the United States.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yugadharma:**
I would like to do also, set a large business up if the //prasādam...//

**Prabhupāda:**
It will be very nice.

**Satsvarūpa:**
Oh.

**Yugadharma:**
That would... Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So you teach them that before Gaura-Nitāi, let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take //prasādam.//

**Yugadharma:**
Yes. I would like to do this in Laguna Beach on the highway.

**Prabhupāda:**
And if you do this, it will be great service, great service. They can take Gaura-Nitāi at home. So let them offer vegetarian food to Gaura-Nitāi and then take it. If you can introduce home to home, it will be great service.

**Yugadharma:**
Because it is a very arty community. They are very interested in art there, and bogus impersonalism. There seems to be a lack of enthusiasm in the //gṛhasthas// in Laguna Beach.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, if they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra...//

**Yugadharma:**
What I would like to do is make you very happy by doing this.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is //yajña. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ// [SB 11.5.32]. This is the way of delivering them: Let them worship Gaura-Nitāi by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// or //śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-prabhu-nityānanda.// If not two, but one, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, and let them take //prasādam.// These two things will make them advance very quickly, the spiritual life.

**Yugadharma:**
Because they are very interested in these little figures.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So if you can do that, it will be very nice.

**Yugadharma:**
How about Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa also?

**Prabhupāda:**
Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa not now.

**Yugadharma:**
Not now.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. When they have actually advanced and initiated and following strictly the Vaiṣṇava principles, then Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. And Gaura-Nitāi, they can worship in any condition.

**Yugadharma:**
I would like also to comprise with Gaura-Nitāi //mūrtis// the very //pakkā// Indian artifacts.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Yugadharma:**
Very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. That will if they keep Gaura-Nitāi...

**Yugadharma:**
Like nice //chāñcas//[?].

**Prabhupāda:**
At least if they see and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, that will make them advance. Chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra// before Gaura-Nitāi will make them very quickly advanced in spiritual consciousness. Very quickly. There is no offense. He does not take any offenses. Whatever little service they do, it is accepted by Gaura-Nitāi. //Pāpī tāpī yata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo.// So if you can do this, it will be very nice. Let them at least keep Gaura-Nitāi there in their room. They'll see. That will be benefit. And if they offer little respect and offer //prasādam// and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, oh, then what to...? It will be very nice. Otherwise, if they simply see the Gaura-Nitāi pair, they will advance.

**Yugadharma:**
Because there is no one actually doing this as I know on the western part of that country.

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore I have encouraged him to prepare Gaura-Nitāi and nicely dress. They can be sold.

**Yugadharma:**
That's good. 'Cause Dhanañjaya and I get along very well. We are very good friends.

**Prabhupāda:**
So they're already sending in foreign countries, Gaura-Nitāi pair?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Are they sending Them yet?

**Yugadharma:**
No. They are making... They have twenty pairs made now, and I have bought Them all. Also one who is also interested is Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa?

**Yugadharma:**
Yes. He has also has given $700 advanced order to Dhanañjaya also for San Francisco area.

**Prabhupāda:**
Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa from...? Who was my secretary?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. He wants to help and come back a little.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Oh, that's nice.

**Yugadharma:**
'Cause there is no one actually doing this in Laguna Beach, and I would like to be a Vaiṣṇava, learn to be a Vaiṣṇava.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, very good. Begin. Yes.

**Yugadharma:**
In this way I will help supply the temple with //lakṣmī.// And this way will be first class. Also, if next time you are in California, if you decide to come to Laguna Beach, we have a present for you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, if I go, I will...

**Yugadharma:**
So this is good. Now I have some service.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. You are seeking for service. That is your advancement. Kṛṣṇa is gracing you. //Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau// [Brs. 1.2.234]. The more we become inclined to render service we become advanced. You have seen our Bombay branch?

**Yugadharma:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Not yet.

**Yugadharma:**
Not yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Vṛndāvana you have been. And Māyāpur?

**Yugadharma:**
Māyāpur, yes. I have family. I have one wife and two children, two daughters there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, where?

**Yugadharma:**
In Māyāpur.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, that's nice.

**Yugadharma:**
They are very nice. They are very excited. In Vṛndāvana I was walking with my daughter on Raman Reti, and she was saying... She is four years old. Her name is Yaśodā. She gave herself the name.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Yugadharma:**
And she said, "Where is Kṛṣṇa?" I said, "If you have the eyes to see Him, you will see Him." So she was walking on the Raman Reti, and she stayed for a minute, and I said, "What is the matter, Yaśodā?" She goes, "I have found Kṛṣṇa's feetprints, footprints." It was very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
When you left Vṛndāvana?

**Yugadharma:**
I left Vṛndāvana one week. It was...

**Prabhupāda:**
So things are going nice?

**Yugadharma:**
Yes, very nice. Everybody is very satisfied.

**Prabhupāda:**
And building?

**Yugadharma:**
Building is going on very well also. They say the front of Gurukula will be finished by the time the devotees come, at least partial. Dhanañjaya will have one store opened, so the devotees can buy..., purchase paraphernalia so they won't go into town and make an array, a display of //lakṣmī// like that. They are setting it up very nicely.

**Prabhupāda:**
The //mūrtis// are made nice?

**Yugadharma:**
Oh, yes. Very nice. This Spanish artist is very, very first class, very first class.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is locally molded?

**Yugadharma:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
And he is giving the finishing touch, polishing.

**Yugadharma:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Yugadharma:**
He is doing what they call "quality control."

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. That's nice.

**Yugadharma:**
He has three sizes. He has four inch, six inch and nine inch.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Yugadharma:**
And they are //mūrtis// that slip off the base. They are very first class. I went to //mūrti-wālā// in Navadvīpa, Gopal.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he's not good.

**Yugadharma:**
No. I went and looked at his prices and his quality...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Don't deal with him. He's a great thief.

**Yugadharma:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
I don't like him. He has made the //karatālas// so third class. He is simply cheating. Don't deal with him.

**Yugadharma:**
Laguna Beach temple... Agnideva dāsa, he's doing very nicely, very first class. Everything is going... Temple life now is very nice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere there should be nicer, because you are getting experience.

**Satsvarūpa:**
I have the mail, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that Jayapatākā Mahārāja brought yesterday from Calcutta.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. Yes. Some book?

**Satsvarūpa:**
Yes. These books were sent by Patita Uddhāraṇa. He's staying at the... [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Devotees, they have dedicated life to this. [break] Where you can get such worshiper by paid man? They are after money. They are not after God. So it will be nice if they hand it over to us. We can take charge. [break] ...eternal propaganda.

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And now we're getting two vans for book distribution.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. And now Gargamuni is asking to purchase this van, and with that money they will purchase Indian van. That will solve the problem. Those who are coming... [break] //Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī// [[books:bg:6:1|[Bg. 6.1]]]. Kṛṣṇa says. //Anāśritaḥ.// Now you are working so hard not for your benefit, personal, and that is //sannyāsī.// That is //sannyāsī. Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryam.// "Oh, it is my duty to serve Kṛṣṇa." And he is //sannyāsī.// Anyone who has got this consciousness, that "It is my duty to serve Kṛṣṇa. I must serve Him with my life and soul and everything," he's a //sannyāsī.// Not the dress. So you are doing that. Now fix up. Go on doing this. Life is successful. That's all. //Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ, sa sannyāsī.// Find out this verse. //Anāśritaḥ karma-phalam.// It is so nice to work for Kṛṣṇa without any personal profit. This is Vṛndāvana. The //gopīs,// they sacrificed everything for Kṛṣṇa---their position, their honor, their prestige. So do like that. I am very glad to see when you work so hard for Kṛṣṇa. That gives me much pleasure.

**Hari-śauri:**

> anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ
> kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ
> sa sannyāsī ca yogī ca
> na niragnir na cākriyaḥ

**Prabhupāda:**
//Cākriyaḥ.// Read?

**Hari-śauri:**
"The blessed Lord said: One who is unattached to the fruits of his work and who works as he is obligated is in the renounced order of life, and he is the true mystic, not he who lights no fire and performs no work."

**Prabhupāda:**
Purport.

**Hari-śauri:**
"In this chapter the Lord explains that the process..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So this is //sannyāsī. Sannyāsī// is not the dress. This mentality, that is //sannyāsa.// So you have taken all //prasādam?// No.

**Jayapatākā:**
Now you'd like to take rest, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

[devotees offer obeisances]

**Prabhupāda:**
So things are going nicely?

**Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you very much. [end]
