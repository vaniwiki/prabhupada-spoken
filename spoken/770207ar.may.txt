====== Arrival Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca// [[books:bg:15:15|[Bg. 15.15]]]. We can submit to Kṛṣṇa. So if Kṛṣṇa’s..., for Kṛṣṇa’s service we submit some plan, He is very glad. You wanted some flower for Kṛṣṇa’s service, Kṛṣṇa is giving us. Everything we wanted for Kṛṣṇa, not for our sense gratification. Then it is... [break] //...Kṛṣṇa til akhila cestha//[?]. For Kṛṣṇa you can endeavor multifariously. That is wanted. That is the contribution of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. Before that, Vaiṣṇavas, they used to live retired life in Vṛndāvana or some other place---no preaching activities. It is the first attempt. Of course, Caitanya Mahāprabhu did it, but the practical sense how we can serve Kṛṣṇa even sitting on big, big buildings and on motorcars we can serve Kṛṣṇa, that is introduced by Bhaktisiddhānta. Otherwise, people were afraid of becoming Vaiṣṇava: "Oh, I’ll have to live underneath a tree like Rūpa Gosvāmī". Some of them will imitate like that. Imitation is no good. Rūpa Gosvāmī never said imitation.

> īhā yasya harer dāsye
> karmaṇā manasā vāchā
> nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu
> jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate
> [Brs. 1.2.187]

Simply that one desire, that "I shall serve Kṛṣṇa," then in any position he is liberated. Any position. And that is confirmed in the //Bhagavad-gītā://

> māṁ ca avyabhicāreṇa
> bhakti-yogena ya sevate
> sa guṇān samatītyaitān
> brahma-bhūyāya kalpate
> [[books:bg:14:26|[Bg. 14.26]]]

So if we are actually sincerely serving Kṛṣṇa, people may be envious, that "These people, living in palatial buildings." Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura said only the devotees shall live in palatial buildings. Only the devotees. Just like the government servants. [Hindi] Government servant, they are given the best place to live in. Similarly, those who are devotees, they should be given all facilities. Not extravagancy, not luxury, but nice food, nice place, nice facilities, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is our Vaiṣṇava... This is not dry. Our mission, we invite everyone, "Come here, live comfortably, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." Don’t become sensuous, but live very nicely and serve Kṛṣṇa.

This is our mission. Especially you coming from European, American countries, you are not accustomed to the hardships of Indian [unclear]. You must have the bare necessities of comfort and serve Kṛṣṇa. That is I am trying to do, and utilize, and you are doing that. I thank you very much for your kind cooperation. And you are the future hope for world preaching. American brain, American money and Indian culture---the ISKCON. Then the whole world will be [indistinct]. This Indian culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and American brain and American money. Everything is successful. Big [indistinct]. Talk very, very nicely. Kṛṣṇa will give you all facilities. He is giving us. When we first purchased this land, we never expected this building of Sridharnatha-tirtha[?]. [chuckling] [indistinct] suggested one Jagannātha temple. Did you not? And then they suggested on Mādhava Mahārāja. You suggested plan one Jagannātha temple here. [laughter] Now our temple is not yet come; it is simply residence of the temple worship. Hmm?

So if you want, we can go. [end]
