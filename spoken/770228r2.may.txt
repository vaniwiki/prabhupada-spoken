====== Conversation with Italian Woman with Translator ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...otherwise we are all part and parcel of God. [translated into Italian throughout for woman guest] When we realize this, then our life is perfect.

**Italian woman:**
[Italian---translated into English by translator throughout]

**Translator:**
She's saying that after rediscovering of last past life...

**Prabhupāda:**
Past life means... As we are not this body, past life means there was another body; we have forgotten it. Just like at night we dream, "I have gone to some foreign place and talking with some foreigners and so on, so on." But in the morning that situation is changed, and we forget everything. Again, at night we forget this body and we dream in another body. Every night we have experience that we forget this body. This is going on.

**Translator:**
She says she's conscious of the relation, karmic relation, with a person that for last life she's having, and right now that person is also present with her in this life.

**Prabhupāda:**
Past life?

**Translator:**
Yes. She's says that four past lives she's having some relations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, that is forgotten or...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
She says that she's remembered it.

**Translator:**
Yeah. She said she remembers it.

**Prabhupāda:**
If she remembers, that's a special qualification; but generally people forget. It is not astonishing. You can remember, but that is rare, very rare.

**Translator:**
So she would like to know from you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if you can give her help to solve the situation she's in.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Translator:**
If you can give her help to solve the situation she has with this person that she lived for four lives now together.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How can Prabhupāda help?

**Translator:**
I know.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
She wants some sort of a... Śrīla Prabhupāda's help is his books, his instructions. She wants some kind of a...

**Prabhupāda:**
Mystic?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, mystical.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not possible.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Crystal ball.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not possible.

**Translator:**
Another thing is that she has a husband, but they don't live together in the same ideas, spiritual ideas. So she wants to know what to do now. Should she go apart from the husband?

**Prabhupāda:**
It has nothing to do with spiritual advancement. It is body. So that is animal conception. Tell her.

**Translator:**
She's still insisting, should she stay with her husband, should she stay alone so she can...?

**Prabhupāda:**
The same thing. Because it is body, bodily connection, either you live alone or with somebody, it has nothing to do with spiritual life.

**Translator:**
She lives in Milano, and she would like, somehow or other, to help people through //yoga.// So she wants to know if she is able to do it or not.

**Prabhupāda:**
What help she can do?

**Translator:**
She says she would like to help spiritually other people.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So first of all you realize yourself.

**Translator:**
She says sometimes she calls you, and she can feel your presence, and she wants to know if you can feel her presence.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I'm ready to help---but spiritually.

**Translator:**
So she said that probably would be the third and last time she will see you, so she wants to know if she can continue to contact you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. //Jaya.// Let her read our Italian //Bhagavad-gītā,// and wherever there is difficulty, she can ask me. Yes. You show her our Italian... She has seen? Italian? That will help her.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Pāñcajanya is the president of our Italian temple.

**Prabhupāda:**
That will help her.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So she has any question, she can write to Prabhupāda. You tell her.

**Translator:**
I told her she must read and study //Bhagavad-gītā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Study. And so long she is here, she can meet me and ask all question.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh.

**Translator:**
She wants a special advice of... Because she's going back to Milano, and she would like to spread the sun that's here present, and she wants to know if you have any advice to her how she should do it, because she would like to go spread it.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is the way. You read regularly //Bhagavad-gītā,// and if there is any difficulty, ask me. I shall explain.

**Translator:**
So she is very happy. She says she was feeling before that you're her spiritual master.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. So where she is living now? In a room?

**Translator:**
She is living with the mother of Jayapatākā.

**Prabhupāda:**
Mother, that's nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayapatākā's mother.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. So she may also become a daughter of Jayapatākā's mother. And live together and read. She understands Italian? No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't know if Jayapatākā's mother...

**Translator:**
She speaks very little. I think she learned a few new words since she came.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, she speaks a little Italian.

**Translator:**
But like an Italian lady, she speaks a lot and very quick, but for the mother of Jayapatākā it's a little difficult to understand.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Anyway, they're associating.

**Prabhupāda:**
Anyway, you read //Bhagavad-gītā,// Italian, and study nicely, and whenever there is any doubt, you can ask me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
