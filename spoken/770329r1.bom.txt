====== Room Conversation with Kuwaiti Guests ======

**Prabhupāda:**
... our whole original consciousness. So any system of religion which revives this consciousness is first-class religion. It doesn't matter whether it is Christian religion or Hindu religion or Muhammadan religion. The system which revives original consciousness---that "I am eternally related with God as part and parcel. My aim of life is go back to home, back to Godhead and to act accordingly"---this is God consciousness.

**Guest:**
Let me ask you one question. Now your God is Hare Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa ...

**Prabhupāda:**
God is one.

**Guest:**
God is one, that's right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Your God, my God---there is no difference.

**Guest:**
God is one.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no such thing.

**Guest:**
Exists and..., //xeris// [Greek: "I know"] Is there any prohibitions in your...

**Prabhupāda:**
God means the supreme controller. So everyone has to accept the supreme controller. So there is no question of "your God," "my God" or "his God."

**Guest (2):**
God is one.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Guest:**
So that means... My religion is...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no "my religion" also. If God is one, then to know God or to abide by the orders of God is religion. According to //Bhāgavata// definition: //dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam// [[books:sb:6:3:19|[SB 6.3.19]]]. //Dharma// means the orders or the law given by God. Just like law means the order given by the state. Nobody can manufacture law at home. The state has ordered, "Keep to the left," that is law. You cannot make "Keep to the right." That is not law. Therefore religion means the order of God. So we must know what is God and what is His order---then you are religious. Otherwise there is no religion. If there is no government, then were is the law? There is no question of law. Law means there must be government, and the order given by the government that is. Similarly...

**Guest (2):**
Do you have a book?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Guest:**
About your religion like this?

**Guest (2):**
Teaching the rules.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Do we have a book which teaches the rules of our religion?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes.

**Guest:**
You have a book.

**Prabhupāda:**
The //Bhagavad-gītā.// We have got many books---this is the beginning, A-B-C-D.

**Guest (2):**
A-B-C-D?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. First of all let us learn A-B-C-D, then you go to higher standards.

**Bhavānanda:**
It's available all over the world. I don't think it's..., is it available...?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can get him a copy. We have extra copies.

**Guest:**
It is not available in my country.

**Bhavānanda:**
It's not available in Kuwait.

**Indian devotee:**
He is saying, "It is not available in my country."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In Kuwait this book is not yet...

**Indian devotee:**
It is available here at the //paṇḍāl.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here we have a copy.

**Bhavānanda:**
We can have one sent to him in Tehran.

**Prabhupāda:**
We have got our center in Tehran, city.

**Guest:**
Actually I saw a picture, sing Hare Kṛṣṇa, movie.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where?

**Guest (2):**
It was last year, about your religion. I saw a picture---Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rama.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, we have got many followers in Tehran. In-charge man, formerly his name was Actal.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Ferosh Attar.

**Prabhupāda:**
Now he is---I have changed his name--- Ātreya Ṛṣi. I have got many Muhammadan disciples. One Dr. Ramzan...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
From where?

**Prabhupāda:**
He is my disciple. In Portland University. I have given him the name Rāmānanda.

**Guest:**
Well, actually sir, I respect your religion, but I would like just to read some books.

**Prabhupāda:**
You will benefit.

**Guest:**
I will take some books with me. I just came from Bombay Hospital after treatment, and the doctor allowed me. I've been walking like this, and then I came here. This gentlemen see me and offered the opportunity to meet you.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you very much.

**Guest:**
Thank you very much.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Can you stay for our program this evening? It'll only be for about an hour, hour and a half.

**Guest:**
Yes. Of course I will.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You can stay?

**Guest:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, thank you.

**Guest:**
Thank you very much.

**Prabhupāda:**
We have got also chanting beads.

**Guest:**
Like ours. Yes. This is, you know, in our religion actually before I pray I have to put this in, what do you call it, //seyara,// we call it //seyara.// So I have...

**Prabhupāda:**
We keep these beads in a bag so that I may not touch here the dust of the floor.

**Guest:**
Oh, I see. No, I don't keep it on the floor, I keep it on the //seyara// because I pray...

**Prabhupāda:**
Just to protect it, because we chant God's name, so it is not different from God.

**Guest:**
That’s right.

**Prabhupāda:**
God's name and God, the same, absolute.

**Guest:**
Absolute.

**Prabhupāda:**

There is no difference of quality between God and His name. When you say Allah and //Allah-u-akbar// ---as you say---there is no difference.

**Guest:**
//Allah-u-akbar.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Allah means "the great." I think so. "God is great." So in connection with His name, whatever is there, it is great.

**Guest:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
So I am very glad that you have come. Please try to study the philosophy.

**Guest:**
Thank you very much, sir.

**Prabhupāda:**
Keep his name and address.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You can hold this up? I have pen. [guest writing his name and address] Thank you. Maybe sometime we can visit you there?

**Guest:**
Oh, yes. Why not?

**Guest (2):**
Can I give you my address?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, please. [guest writing the address] Which is the address?

**Gues (2):**
This is the address, this is my telephone number.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is your address?

**Guest (2):**
Kuwait... state of police.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What does this mean, "state of police."

**Guest:**
Police department.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Are you a member of the police department there?

**Guest:**
Yes, municipal police.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Municipal?

**Guest:**

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
