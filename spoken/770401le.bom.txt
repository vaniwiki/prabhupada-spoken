====== Lecture ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...and shall remain up to eight. So our //darśana// and talks, if there is any, generally, every day it will be done. And on Sunday you can fix up some time. I will speak in the evening. And then Kṛṣṇa's desire, as He likes. For the time being, this arrangement.

So what is that verse? //Divya-jñāna hṛde prakāśito.// Just recite that. [Indians repeat] Before that.

**Indian guests:**
//Prema-bhakti yāhā hoite, avidyā vināśa yāte.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So the necessity is //prema-bhakti. Prema-bhakti yāhā hoite, avidyā vināśa yāte, divya-jñāna.// So what is that //divya-jñāna? Divya// means transcendental, not material. //Tapo divyam// [[books:sb:5:5:1|[SB 5.5.1]]]. //Divyam// means we are combination of matter and spirit. That spirit is //divya,// transcendental. //Apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parā// [[books:bg:7:5|[Bg. 7.5]]]. That is //parā prakṛti,// superior. If there is the superior identity... And for understanding that superior identity we require superior knowledge, not ordinary knowledge. //Divya-jñāna hṛde prakāśito.// So this is the duty of the //guru,// to awaken that //divya-jñāna. Divya-jñāna.// And because //guru// enlightens that //divya-jñāna,// he is worshiped. That is required. The modern... Modern or always; this is //māyā.// That //divya-jñāna// is never, I mean to say, manifested. They are kept in the darkness of //adivya-jñāna. Adivya-jñāna// means "I am this body." "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," this is //adivya-jñāna. Dehātma-buddhiḥ. Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri// [SB 10.84.13]. I am not this body.

So the beginning of //divya-jñāna// is there when we try to understand that "I am not this body. I am superior element, I am spirit soul. This is inferior. So why should I remain in this inferior knowledge?" We should not remain in the inferior... Inferior knowledge means darkness. //Tamasi mā.// The Vedic injunction is, "Don't remain in the inferior knowledge." //Jyotir gamaḥ:// "Come to the superior knowledge." So to worship //guru// means because he gives us superior knowledge. Not this knowledge---how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex life and defend. Generally, the political leaders, social leaders, they give this knowledge---how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex, how to defend. A //guru// has no business with these things. He is //divya-jñāna,// superior knowledge. That is required. This human form of life is an opportunity to awaken that //divya-jñāna hṛde prakāśito.// And if he's kept in darkness about that //divya-jñāna,// simply if he is trained up how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex and to defend, then life will be lost. That is a great loss. //Mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani. Aprāpya māṁ nivartante mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]. Very risky life if we do not awaken our //divya-jñāna.// We should always remember this. Very risky life---once again thrown into the waves of birth and death, we do not know where I am going. Very serious. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness is //divya-jñāna.// It is not ordinary knowledge. Everyone should try to understand this //divya-jñāna. Daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritam.// Therefore one who is interested in this //divya-jñāna,// he is called //daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritam.// From //daivī, divya// comes, the Sanskrit word. Sanskrit word, from //daivī, divya,// adjective.

So //mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ// [[books:bg:9:13|[Bg. 9.13]]]. One who has taken to this //divya-jñāna// process, he is //mahātmā. Mahātmā// is not made by stamping for receiving knowledge how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex. That is not the definition in the //śāstra. Sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ.//

> bahūnāṁ janmanām ante
> jñānavān māṁ prapadyante
> vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti
> sa mahātmā...
> [[books:bg:7:19|[Bg. 7.19]]]

One who has got this //divya-jñāna, vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā,// that is //mahātmā.// But that is very, very rare. Otherwise, //mahātmā// like me, they are loitering in the street. That is their business. So you should always remember this word, //divya-jñāna hṛde prakāśito.// And because the spiritual master enlightens the //divya-jñāna,// one feels obliged to him. //Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādo yasya prasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.// So this //guru-pūjā// essential. As the Deity worship essential... It is not cheap adoration. It is the process of enlightening the //divya-jñāna.//

Thank you very much.
