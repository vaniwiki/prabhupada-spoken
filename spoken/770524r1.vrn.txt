====== Short Discussions ======

**Prabhupāda:**
But the disease is not ordinary. It is always fatal. But by His especial mercy anything can be done. That is another thing. Lost appetite means life finished. [pause] //Tāvad tanu-bhṛtāṁ tvad upekṣitānām// [[books:sb:7:9:19|[SB 7.9.19]]]. If Kṛṣṇa neglects, then nobody can live, but if He likes that "He must live," anything can happen. That is possible. //Anityam asukhaṁ lokam imaṁ prāpya bhajasva mām// [[books:bg:9:33|[Bg. 9.33]]]. //Anityam asukhaṁ lokaṁ bhajasva mām.// Otherwise failure. Everything is there in the //Bhagavad-gītā.// [pause] [break] [Hindi] [break] [end]
