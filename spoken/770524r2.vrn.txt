====== Short Discussions ======

**Prabhupāda:**
...London. Guru Mahārāja sending him regularly seven hundred rupees per month. In those days seven hundred means at least...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Twenty times?

**Prabhupāda:**
That was in 1936. Rice has increased after 1940.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
At least it was twenty thousand rupees' value now.

**Prabhupāda:**
All of a sudden rice has increased in 1942 by Churchill's artificial increasing his bribe to recruit soldiers. I have seen. Within two hours the price of rice, from six rupees it came to fifty rupees.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Phew. Completely artificial.

**Prabhupāda:**
I was in the grocer's shop purchasing, and all of a sudden the grocer says, "No, no, I am not going to sell any more." He got some information. So that time, six rupees per //mound,// first class...

**Bhavānanda:**
Per //mound.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Per //mound.// Very first class rice. So he was not going to sell. A few hours after, I went to purchase---fifty rupees. From six rupees. Government appointed agents to purchase it and stock it. So people, being harassed, they'll come to military. This was Churchill's...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Those British were very clever.

**Prabhupāda:**
Artificially created a famine in India. I have seen.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So Bon Mahārāja was getting seven hundred rupees monthly. That's amazing. Your Guru Mahārāja had to send the money from India to the West. We... You're bringing the money, but for Bon Mahārāja he had to send the money the other way.

**Prabhupāda:**
Every month, regularly. He was playing harmonium. And the report: "Swāmījī is playing on harmonium." Therefore Guru Mahārāja became very much disgusted: "Call him back."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He said they had to serve meat.

**Prabhupāda:**
I do not know that. But he was a waste of money, that's all. He's still wasting money. What he has done? Has he published any books like that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, he has a big degree now.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Nonsense degree. Who cares for his degree?

**Bhavānanda:**
You've got many nice young, staunch Bengali //brahmacārīs,// eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two years old.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They joined?

**Prabhupāda:**
Where?

**Bhavānanda:**
At different times. Now all, they have become very strong. Finally it's happened. We have a //brahmacārī// core. And they're all anxious... This week they're all going out preaching, everyone.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Gītār Gān// selling nice?

**Bhavānanda:**
//Gītār Gān// is selling nice. //Bhagavāner Kathā// is selling nice. //Bhāgavata Darśana.// We sell two //Bhāgavata Darśana, Gītār Gān// and //Bhagavāner Kathā.// The people take it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All. They take the whole set.

**Bhavānanda:**
They like the set, you know. One rupee for one book, they stop and think, but if they pay four rupees, 4.50, for four books, they think they're getting a lot for their money. But one rupee for one book is more difficult.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Bangladesh?

**Bhavānanda:**
Now Jayapatākā Mahārāja is here. He's filled with glowing reports, glowing. "The new frontier, new preaching frontier."

**Prabhupāda:**
Muhammadans also.

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, he said Muhammadans invited him to speak, and they're very... They don't even know, he said, who is Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It's been so long since Partition, and they've been cut off. They don't even... One Muhammadan lawyer bought a //Caitanya-caritāmṛta.// Wanted to read about Him, he said.

**Prabhupāda:**
Full set? Full set?

**Bhavānanda:**
I think one book.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I was just inquiring whether you were drinking fruit juice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fruit juice is very good.

**Bhavānanda:**
I noticed, Śrīla Prabhupāda, your complexion is yellowish. Liver is...

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no hope of life. Therefore we have called you. This condition is hopeless. We have given our will. Now we can... If I die in Vṛndāvana, there is no harm. But Kṛṣṇa can play anything wonderful. But from physical condition there is no hope.

**Bhavānanda:**
But Kṛṣṇa is Parameśvara.

**Prabhupāda:**
[laughs] Yes. That is another thing.

**Bhavānanda:**
That is all of our prayer.

**Prabhupāda:**
I have become very, very weak. No appetite. The brain is not working. Brain is working, but body is not allowing... Don't worry. Everyone will die, today or tomorrow. I am also old man. There is nothing to be regrettable. So as far as possible in my body, I am complete... Now it is up to Kṛṣṇa to judge. I have no objection.

**Bhavānanda:**
What can we do, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
You can pray Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Kṛṣṇa is all-powerful. My only request is that whatever I have done, you don't spoil it. That's all. Think this. I am getting report, very hopeful, as you gave report from Māyāpur, very good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Want to take a little rest now, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break] [end]
