====== Short Discussions ======

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi]

**Indian man (2):**
[Hindi] [Hindi conversation]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] Then why we have to make another tank?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They said that the... If we want water in that bathroom, then we have to have our own water hookup there.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who said?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The electric man who came there, the man from the electricity department. Their point was that there's more parties using the water than just ourselves. So if we do not... There has to be some way of determining who's using what water supply.

**Prabhupāda:**
Talk with the same man.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The man came today from electric department.

**Indian man (1):**
Vadepal[?] contractor.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hah. He said that this one Kalachand Goswami, he is living there, and he is using water. And we are living there, and we're using water. So how to determine who should pay for what water? There must be two meters.

**Indian man (1):**
Extra meter wanted.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hah, one meter for the water he uses and electricity he uses, and one meter for the water and electricity we use.

**Indian man (1):**
Electricity to your restaurant? Direct to [indistinct]? [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But who pays Kalachand's electricity?

**Indian man (1):**
Kalachanjī's //śiṣya,// Madana Mohana Goswami.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Śiṣya.// So how to judge how much electricity is used by us and how much electricity is being used or taken by the Kalachand Goswami? How to know how much he is using, how much we are using? If there is only one meter...

**Indian man (2):**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now there's no meter. There's only one meter for whole thing. For whole site there's only one meter, water meter. But there are two parties. One is the Kalachand, and one we are.

**Indian man (1):**
So you install meter in your room?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Ha, ha. Yes. They want to put extra meter in the room.

**Indian man (2):**
We have to have extra meter.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
To determine that we should only...

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi]

**Jayapatākā:**
[Hindi or Bengali] [Hindi conversation with scattered English about water and electricity meters]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So he's saying that 'cause...

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayapatākā's saying... He's translating what they were talking, that there's already a meter for electricity. This new meter is proposed simply for water. But the cost of water is so cheap, what is the need of a meter?

**Jayapatākā:**
They're not making any claim for water. They say, "How much water you can use? It's a matter of a few paisa."

**Prabhupāda:**
Last time the [indistinct] Goswami and Gurudāsa, the arrangement was to live without paying anything.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Right.

**Prabhupāda:**
To pay the electric charge. So he was paying about sixty-four rupees' electric charges. They were using hugely.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Including water.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Electric.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Electric.

**Jayapatākā:**
Per year.

**Prabhupāda:**
Per month.

**Jayapatākā:**
Sixty-four rupees!

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sixty-four rupees a month!

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So now we have a separate meter for electricity. There's already a separate meter for electricity, is it?

**Indian man (3):**
Yes, you have got your own.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Besides Madana Mohana, there's another one.

**Indian man (3):**
He has. That's all right. Why it is not working?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Because there was a wire that was not connected. Then the man came today, and he has connected, and he said, "Now you will have electricity."

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] [Hindi conversation]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So then we said, "All right, we also need water." He said, "For that, you will need a separate meter because they, Madana Mohana Goswami, does not want to pay your water costs." Then the man said, "Yes, we can put separate meter. It will take ten days to two weeks."

**Indian man (3):**
Oh, yes, you will do it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But it will take some time, they say.

**Prabhupāda:**
So better to arrange.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Better to avoid?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Tap...

**Indian man (3):**
For the time being you have water from Kalachand. Give the man his time. He will give.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He will give.

**Indian man (3):**
He will give you, and he'll ask Gurudāsa[?] also. Then he will do all, what is needful. Kalachand is a man of...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Where you are getting your drinking water from?

**Indian man (3):**
I? From my own pipe.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
From pipe. Pipe water is good for drinking.

**Indian man (3):**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Ācchā.// Not from well.

**Indian man (3):**
No, no.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well water is not good for drinking?

**Indian man (3):**
At Lotan Kunj, just a hundred yards from our temple, that well is very nice well.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is the name?

**Indian man (3):**
Lotan Kunj.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Lotan Kunj.

**Indian man (3):**
First-class water.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Any time.

**Indian man (3):**
Yes, oh, yes. People take from that well water to their houses.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Anyone can come? Anyone can take, public?

**Indian man (2):**
Yes, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Lotan Kunj.

**Indian man (3):**
It is just near our temple. We use the Damodar Gela[?]. Damodar Gela is there. We use that water. Our, these boys and these, they drink it.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And for washing and cooking we can get some water from Kalachand.

**Indian man (3):**
Oh, yes. Kalachand has well also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And well also. //Ācchā.// Then there's no problem, Prabhupāda. We'll apply for our separate meter, and in the meantime, we'll take the water...

**Indian man (3):**
Oh, yes. For the time being you will be...

**Indian man (1):**
[Hindi]

**Indian man (3):**
[Hindi] For the time being he will be helpful to give you water, but that's all. [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's good. Prabhupāda, should I bring up the point that these rooms should be... [Hindi conversation between guests]

**Indian man (3):**
On 28th May, he is expected to attend the civil judge, Mathura, you see. So on that day, if he comes here, have a discussion from him.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Madana Mohana Goswami?

**Indian man (3):**
Yes. What he says?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There actually, there's no... What about latrine?

**Indian man (3):**
Latrine is behind there. You put one inside, Swāmījī's latrine.

**Indian man (2):**
[Hindi]

**Indian man (3):**
That was closed by Madana Mohana Goswami.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He closed off that latrine.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is back side.

**Indian man (3):**
[Hindi conversation between guests about tape recorder] I don't want to talk with the tape recorder. I come to honor my Swāmījī and my elder brother...

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We tape everything Prabhupāda says. Everything he says, we tape, whether you're here or not here.

**Indian man (3):**
No, I don't want to talk on the machine. I don't want you to make.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We're not taping for any other purpose, but our Guru Mahārāja's words are very sacred to us, so we tape all the time, whether you're here or not here.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, he has objection to the tape...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'm just explaining that it's not any, er,... [break] [end]
