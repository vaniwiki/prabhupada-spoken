====== Conversations with Kīrtana Groups and Sannyāsa Initiation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
//Janme janme prabhu sei.// Spiritual master who has opened the eyes, he is, spiritual master, the life of the disciple. Do not... He cannot be [indistinct]. //Janme janme prabhu sei.// Life of the disciple. //Cakhu-dān dilo jei, janme janme prabhu sei.// Nobody can repay the indebtedness of spiritual master, even by getting a duration of life like Brahmā. There is a verse in //Śrīmad... Brahma... Brahma-saṁ... Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Ādi-līlā,// there is a verse. //Sei... Sei guru.// All right.

**Yaśodānandana:**
"The Lord has suggested, therefore, that by the influence..." [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...meat-eating, gambling and intoxication. Find out throughout the whole world if they can give up these bad habits by adopting any other means. But one who has taken to the //bhakti-yoga,// they have given up very easily. Is it not?

**Hari-śauri:**
Yeah, immediately.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Anartha upaśamaṁ sākṣāt// [[books:sb:1:7:6|[SB 1.7.6]]]. Nobody dies without illicit sex or intoxication. //Anartha,// unnecessarily they are habituated. There is no need, but by bad association you have practiced this, habituated, cannot be given up. LSD... Government spends so much, millions of dollars, that "These hippies may give up." Not successful. See practically. And as soon as they come to our camp, they give up. Is it not?

**Jayapatākā:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Anartha upaśamaṁ sākṣāt.// In every step //anartha.// This material life means //anartha.// There is no need, but //anādi karama phale.// Due to our //karma// we are put into this unfavorable condition, and it is very difficult to come out of it. But if you take to //bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje,// immediately. Who is taking, without any force... How practical it is. //Anartha upaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.//

**Hari-śauri:**

> vāsudeve bhagavati
> bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ
> janayaty āśu vairāgyaṁ
> jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam
> [[books:sb:1:2:7|[SB 1.2.7]]]

**Prabhupāda:**
The same //bhakti-yoga.// This is practical.

**Jayapatākā:**
Now there's another group.

**Yaśodānandana:**
//Jaya oṁ viṣṇupāda paramahaṁsa parivrājakācārya aṣṭottara-śata śrī-śrīmad...// [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
They do not know. They'll not pay. All dry flowers they'll supply you and take American money. He'll not pay. Anyway, satisfy yourself. So it is raining?

**Hari-śauri:**
It's beginning to.

**Devotee:**
Starts now?

**Devotee (2):**
A little bit. A little bit it was raining. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Bhavānanda?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He is at the fire sacrifice.

**Prabhupāda:**
Fire sacrifice not yet finished?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then when it will be finished?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Usually after they put on their //dhoti,// then the fire sacrifice begins.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no. Fire sacrifice... Let it be finished. Who told them before fire sacrifice begins they should put on...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't know who.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody has got...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Bhavānanda said that they should come here.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they should attend the fire sacrifice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He hasn't begun the sacrifice yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
You go and begin and then come. Fire sacrifice finished. Our...

**Indian devotee (1):**
Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
He said that fire sacrifice not yet... They'll do...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, I know when I got //sannyāsa,// first...

**Indian devotee (1):**
I was also thinking it should be...

**Prabhupāda:**
All right. All right, you shall go. So one by one, they should change their cloth. Can you help them?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
In the meantime let me go to the latrine. [break] ...I think. [Bengali]

**Bhakti-caru:**
//Etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām...//

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Indian devotee (2):**
//Etāṁ sa āsthāya...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām.//

**Indian devotee (2):**
//Etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Adhyāsitāṁ pūrva...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Adhyāsitāṁ pūrvatamair maharṣibhiḥ.//

**Indian devotee (2):**
//Adhyāsitāṁ pūrvatamair maharṣibhiḥ.//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Ahaṁ tariṣyāmi...//

**Devotees:**
//Ahaṁ tariṣyāmi...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Duranta-pāram...//

**Devotees:**
//Duranta-pāram...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Tamo mukundāṅghri...//

**Devotees:**
//Tamo mukundāṅghri...//

**Prabhupāda:**
//Niṣevayaiva.//

**Devotees:**
//Niṣevayaiva.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Now chant properly.

**Devotees:**

> etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām
> adhyāsitāṁ pūrvatamair maharṣibhiḥ
> ahaṁ tariṣyāmi duranta-pāraṁ
> tamo mukundāṅghri-niṣevayaiva
> [SB 11.23.57]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Devotees:**
[repeat same verse]

**Prabhupāda:**
The meaning, that "I am taking this //sannyāsa// for the purpose of crossing over the ocean of nescience." //Etāṁ sa āsthāya parātma-niṣṭhām. Parātma-niṣṭha,// Bhagavān, Paramātmā. Simply to serve Kṛṣṇa. So here are three //daṇḍas.// One //daṇḍa,// person. There are four //daṇḍas.// He is person, "I am." And the other three //daṇḍa,// my mind---//kāya manaḥ vākya//---my body and my words. "So I dedicate my mind, my body and my activities, //parātma-niṣṭha,// only for the service of the Supreme. So being situated in that position, following..." //Pūrvatamair maharṣibhiḥ.// It is not that I have introduced something new. All big, big //ācāryas,// they took //sannyāsa// for this preaching work---Rāmānuja, Madhvācārya, Śaṅkarācārya even. And that is //pūrvatamair maharṣibhiḥ. Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ// [[books:cc:madhya:17:186|[Cc. Madhya 17.186]]]. We have to follow //maharṣibhiḥ.// So "All //ācāryas// of India, they have taken //sannyāsa,// so I am also taking //sannyāsa.// The business is //parātma-niṣṭha.//" So what will be the benefit? //Ahaṁ tariṣyāmi duranta-pāram:// "This ocean of nescience is //duranta-pāram.// It is very, very difficult to cross over. But I'll cross over." How? //Tamaḥ.// This is darkness, //tamaḥ. Mukundāṅghri-niṣevayaiva:// "Simply by serving the lotus feet of Mukunda." Mukunda means "one who can give liberation, //mukti.//" Mukunda. So chant again this.

**Devotees:**
[repeat same verse]

**Prabhupāda:**
Again.

**Devotees:**
[repeat same verse]

**Prabhupāda:**
Again.

**Devotees:**
[repeat same verse]

**Prabhupāda:**
So now... Whose //daṇḍa// it is?

**Indian devotee:**
Mine.

**Prabhupāda:**
Take this //daṇḍa.// Then... Hmm. Come on. [Bengali] ...Prema-bhakti Swami... [Bengali] ...Bhakti-prema Swami. [Bengali] Bhakti-caitanya Swami. //Thik hai?// [Bengali] //Tomāra nāma habe...// [Bengali] Bhakti-caru Swami... So what is your name?

**Bhakti-caitanya:**
Bhakti-caitanya Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
Your?

**Prema-bhakti:**
Prema-bhakti Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
And your?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Bhakti-caru Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
So now you can go attend the, yes, sacrifice. Then, conveniently, you have to take the //gāyatrī-mantra,// and he has to take the //gāyatrī-mantra.// Then it will be all right.

**Bhakti-caitanya:**
So come again to take that...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, after initiation. And here is...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He already got //gāyatrī.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, he has got?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. [Bengali] Hare Kṛṣṇa. Help them, all senior //sannyāsīs.// If there is some mistake, correct them. Cooperation and... [Bengali] Everyone. That's all. There is //mālā?// Give them //mālā// each. Yes. That's all. Give them.

**Indian devotee (3):**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] He has already gone?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, he... Śrīla Prabhupāda, Bhakti-prema Swami wants to know if he can get the //gāyatrī// now, if you want to give him //gāyatrī...//

**Prabhupāda:**
No, first of all attend.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All right. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is the //gāyatrī-mantra// sheet?

**Indian devotee (3):**
Where is //gāyatrī-mantra?// Thread?

**Prabhupāda:**
//Gāyatrī-mantra// sheet. Let the [indistinct]. All right, finish this business. Finish up. [Bengali] All together, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. [//kīrtana// begins] Loudly. [break] [//prema-dhvani// prayers]

**Devotees:**
//Raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.//

**Prabhupāda:**
That's it.

**Devotees:**
//Jaya.// Śrīla Prabhupāda //ki jaya!// [offer obeisances] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
So now you can disperse. I'll give him.

**Hari-śauri:**
//Gāyatrī-mantra.//

**Devotees:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda //ki jaya!//

**Prabhupāda:**
What is time now?

**Brahmānanda:**
Quarter of ten.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's all right.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhavānanda:**
You said you wanted to shave and have your head shaved today?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, I'll do it after. [break]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So why don't you develop?

**Prabhupāda:**
That's a fact. //Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham// [Bs. 5.35]. Even within the atom there is living entity. Just like within the seed there is living entity, and when the seed gets favorable circumstances, the life is there. It fructifies. Different seeds, different life.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
This is true only, though, in the earth planet. In the earth.

**Prabhupāda:**
Earth?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
In this planet.

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere. //Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi// [Padma Purāṇa]. Everywhere there is water and there is... That's all.

**Brahmānanda:**
But there is not water on every planet.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is rascals' theory, all rascals. Wherever there is planet, there is water, there is everything. If there is no water, wherefrom the sand comes? Scientifically? What is the sand? Hmm?

**Brahmānanda:**
The composition of sand?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Composition is silica.

**Prabhupāda:**
Silica. What is silica?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Silica contains one atom of silicon and two atoms of oxygen, but in the case of an acid, it contains two atoms of hydrogen.

**Prabhupāda:**
Acid is liquid.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Silicic acid.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Silicic acid, it forms with water and silicon.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. So... And without water, where silica comes? They are all rascals. Wherever there is silica, there must be water, dried up or existing.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It's true, though, that there is water, but not as much as we find...

**Prabhupāda:**
But that is another. Water must be there. Without water, there is no question of silica.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I was thinking that... Just like in the sun planet, you said the body has to be fiery, like the sun, so in that sense the...

**Prabhupāda:**
That does not mean there is no water.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
There is water, but it's very small amount.

**Prabhupāda:**
Small or big, that is another thing. There must be water. Even within the fire there is water.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
So life has to develop through that water.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Through that water, that small amount of water, the life has to develop.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no question of... That small amount is sufficient, according to the circumstance. Just like in the desert they don't require much water, the camels. Once drunk, they can go on the desert for three days. You cannot do that. There is water. Otherwise how watermelon is coming?

**Brahmānanda:**
Even the cactus plants, they're able to grow, and they store the water...

**Prabhupāda:**
Everywhere there are these... These rascals, they do not know. Everything is there, every planet.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The five gross elements is present in all the...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kṣitir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ// [[books:bg:7:4|[Bg. 7.4]]]. Must... [aside:] Give me. Give me that.

**Indian devotee (4):**
Still down?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [break] Everywhere there is life, there is everything, varieties. Here you see in the water there is life, in the land there is life, in the air there is life, within the silicate there is life. So many, many millions. These crabs... What is called? Crab?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Crab.

**Prabhupāda:**
How they are living? As soon as you walk, they go within the sand.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Recently they also found out that there are some..., called bacteria. They live in a very unusual circumstances. They can survive to 150 degrees. And sometimes they live inside ammonia, ammonia solution, without water. They can survive.

**Prabhupāda:**
Not without water. There is water, but not as much. Just like on the land there is water, but in the sea there are so much water. So there is life; there is life. We don't say that in the land there is no water. Everywhere is there are different. So this evolution, //jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi,// it has developed the same way. The first life comes out. Then everywhere there is life. The transportation from higher planet to lower planet---water.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Water?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. The rainfall. With the rainfall, those who are fallen souls, they are coming down. Then takes shelter within the atom. Then again grows.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It's interesting that science says also that in the beginning there was only hydrogen. So actually water is... Its main composition is two parts of hydrogen...

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
...one part of oxygen. So if the soul is coming through this water, through rain from higher planetary system...

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kṣīṇe puṇye punar martya-lokaṁ viśanti// [[books:bg:9:21|[Bg. 9.21]]]. They elevate, again fall down. This is going on. //Mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani// [[books:bg:9:3|[Bg. 9.3]]]. //Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama// [[books:bg:15:6|[Bg. 15.6]]]. But when they go to Kṛṣṇaloka, then they are... [break]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
That also corresponds with another theory, a scientific theory, is that the origin of life comes from other planets. That is one theory. Not Darwin. This is not Darwin.

**Prabhupāda:**
Darwin... Grand rascal. All speculation. Transportation I told.

> kabhu svarge uṭhāya kabhu narake ḍubāya
> daṇḍya-jane rājā yena nadīte cubāya
> [[books:cc:madhya:20:118|[Cc. Madhya 20.118]]]

Just try to explain to them. [break] ...interesting. I can give you the ideas; you put in the scientific way. But whatever idea I give, that's a fact. They have stopped making propaganda about going to Mars?

**Brahmānanda:**
Going to Mars? They've stopped propaganda?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yeah, they are a little silent.

**Prabhupāda:**
[chuckles] Hoax. First hoax was little successful. Now they say it will not be very successful.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
One aspect in science that they're worried more nowadays is called biomedical ethics. That means they are worried about so-called this genetic engineering. They say by this engineering they can develop some small insects or microbes that will be great harmful. It will be very harmful to the society. So these big, big schools like MIT and Harvard, they are... Some of the leading scientists in this field, they're very much concerned about this new development. [end]
