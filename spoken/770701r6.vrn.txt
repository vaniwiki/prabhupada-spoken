====== Conversation ======

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
But you've given us... Even if you didn't give us...

**Prabhupāda:**
Nobody. All these //sannyāsīs,// they leave. They do not give. They cannot give. They have no knowledge. Here the blind man, //kānā,// they keep them in darkness by some hobby and beggar, this, that, that... Actually they cannot do anything.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I was just appreciating how in every way you have provided for your disciples, in every aspect. You've created this movement, so we have beautiful temples. You've given us this wonderful philosophy in books. In every way you've provided. You've given us these places, Vṛndāvana temple and Māyāpur temple. It's actually a fact that we can... You know, it's like a very loving father who provides everything for his children. I mean, I was just comparing that to this boy who had nothing. His //guru// expired, and he had nothing. He was bereft. But we'll always be very much provided for and cared for.

**Prabhupāda:**
So with that feeling I want to produce them also, my followers. Everyone should be like that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Like the rain cloud pours water everywhere. Did you speak with Akṣayānanda Swami last night or something? No. So...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, no... They were... There will be no disturbance from his side.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I have seen. Mr. Myer cannot do anything as long as... Mr. Myer, he... At this point Akṣayānanda Mahārāja is running everything. Mr. Myer cannot do anything more than just...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, I shall do. Both of them can be told.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's the best. Okay. 'Cause Mr. Myer was wondering if Akṣayānanda Mahārāja had been told, because Akṣayānanda Mahārāja didn't mention anything to him. The best thing is to call them both. Okay. Let's see if the others have come, Śrīla Prabhupāda, for showing. [end]
