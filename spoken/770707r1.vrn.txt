====== Room Conversations ======

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Everything was "probably" in their books.

**Prabhupāda:**
"Probably," "maybe."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Those are their favorite words. Śrīla Prabhupāda? We're receiving a number of letters now, and these are people who want to get initiated. So up until now, since your becoming ill, we asked them to wait. Huh.

**Prabhupāda:**
The local, mean, senior //sannyāsīs// can do that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's what we were doing... I mean, formerly we were..., the local GBC, //sannyāsīs,// were chanting on their beads, and they were writing to Your Divine Grace, and you were giving a spiritual name. So should that process be resumed, or should we...? I mean, one thing is that it's said that the spiritual master takes on the... You know, he takes on the... He has to cleanse the disciple by... So we don't want that you should have to... Your health is not so good, so that should not be... That's why we've been asking everybody to wait. I just want to know if we should continue to wait some more time.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, the senior //sannyāsīs...//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So they should continue to...

**Prabhupāda:**
You can give me a list of //sannyāsīs.// I will mark who will...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can do. Kīrtanānanda can do. And our Satsvarūpa can do. So these three, you can give, begin.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So supposing someone is in America, should they simply write directly to Kīrtanānanda or Satsvarūpa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Nearby. Jayatīrtha can give.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayatīrtha.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bhavānan..., er, Bhagavān. And he can do also. Harikeśa.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Harikeśa Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
And... Five, six men, you divide who is nearest.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who is nearest. So persons wouldn't have to write to Your Divine Grace. They could write directly to that person?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Actually they are initiating the person on Your Divine Grace's behalf. Those persons who are initiated are still your...

**Prabhupāda:**
Second initiation we shall think over, second initiation.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is for first initiation. Okay. And for second initiation, for the time being they should...

**Prabhupāda:**
No, they have to wait. Second initiation, that should be given...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Should... Some devotees are writing you now for second initiation, and I'm writing them to wait a while because you're not well. So can I continue to tell them that?

**Prabhupāda:**
They can do second initiation.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
By writing you.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. These men.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These men, they can also do second initiation. So there's no need for devotees to write to you for first and second initiation. They can write to the man nearest them. But all these persons are still your disciples. Anybody who gives initiation is doing so on your behalf.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You know that book I'm maintaining of all of your disciples' names? Should I continue that?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So if someone gives initiation, like Harikeśa Mahārāja, he should send the person's name to us here, and I'll enter it in the book. Okay. Is there someone else in India that you want to do this?

**Prabhupāda:**
India, I am here. We shall see. In India, Jayapatākā.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Jayapatākā Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
You are also in India.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can note down these names.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, I have them.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who are they?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja, Satsvarūpa Mahārāja, Jayatīrtha Prabhu, Bhagavān Prabhu, Harikeśa Mahārāja, Jayapatākā Mahārāja and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice. Now you distribute.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Seven. There's seven names.

**Prabhupāda:**
For the time being, seven names, sufficient. You can make Rāmeśvara.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Rāmeśvara Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Hṛdayānanda.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yeah. South America.

**Prabhupāda:**
So without waiting for me, wherever you consider it is right... That will depend on discretion.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
On discretion.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's for first and second initiations.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. Shall I send a //kīrtana// party, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [end]
