====== Room Conversations ======

**Prabhupāda:**
And his wife takes four bottles of Nux Vomica. If he said that "Dr. Bannerji prescribes Nux Vomica in different doses to every person, therefore we finished the Nux Vomica bottle very quickly." He was the biggest customer for Nux Vomica, Tincture Nux Vomica. So he... And he was very famous doctor. And Abhinas Chandra Bannerji, he went to Allahabad very poor condition. Then, by medical practice, he became very rich man. I think simply by the mercy of Nux Vomica. So one must know the right way. [coughs]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How's your cold, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
There is nothing.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is it changing the condition at all? We should think how to get rid of it.

**Prabhupāda:**
How to rid it?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I remember one thing you were taking to loosen the phlegm in Māyāpur when you had a cough. You were taking a little hot lemon juice in the mornings.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can give me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I remember that. It seemed to have good effects. It also helped for digestion.

**Prabhupāda:**
So any other?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No. Actually, I'm right in the middle of doing these accounts, so I probably should...

**Prabhupāda:**
[coughing] So this bank manager came. It means they are little serious.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, this is a real good sign. The last request of the head office is a very good sign. The head office is requesting, "Now please take the letter for him to sign..." It means that they're planning how to get the branch open. And I told this man that "If you get this opened, then surely we will open your branch in our Māyāpur center as well in all other centers."

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They are a good bank. There's no doubt.

**Prabhupāda:**
That Mr. Neta came?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
His name is Mr. Pattak, isn't it?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, Pattak, Pattak. Yes. That's all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
After massage I can come and see you and give some... [break] [end]
