====== Room Conversation Astrologer’s Report ======

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...reading of your chart for free, Śrīla Prabhupāda. The man is a devotee. I thought it would be good to read to you. His name is Gopesh Kumar Ojaḥ, and his son's name is Asutosh Ojaḥ.

**Brahmānanda:**
He asked for Prabhupāda's blessings.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. He wanted your blessings. He says... This is a very detailed chart he did. All the calculations are given. He said //Śukra// as //Munteśa,[?] Varṣa-lagneśa,[?]// has no directional strength. Therefore the solar return is not good. The lord of the sixth house is conjunct, //maṅgala,// not good. The following days are not auspicious: the 27th to the 28th of September, the 24th to the 25th of October, the 20th, 21st, and 22nd of November, and 3rd and 4th of December. He says, "Śrīla Prabhupādajī is at present undergoing the fag end of //Ketu Mahādaśa,// and it will last until the 13th of January, 1978. //Ketu// is in the eight house."

**Brahmānanda:**
Means death.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's the house of death, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This eight house is called the house of death. He says, "//Ketu// is in the eighth house with the sun, which is the lord of the eighth house, and //Krusu,// the lord of the twelfth and third houses." They are all in the eighth house. "Mercury in //Ketu// started from 16th January." He says, " //Budha// is the //satesa// also, disease. //Śani// has gone to the eighth house, which is the house of death, from the 7th September." That's the day you had your operation. "//Śani// as //lagneśa// in the eighth house and the transit over Jupiter and //Ketu.// The negative effect continues throughout October 1977, November 1977, and from the first of December, 1977, Saturn becomes almost stationary and becomes more malefic." Says Saturn becomes even worse. "In January 1978 until April 1978 it again traverses the same degrees and becomes stagnant on Jupiter and //Ketu// in the last week of February. The native has..."

**Prabhupāda:**
January '77 we have passed.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
January '78, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It says that you're supposed to have lived for seventy-five years, but everything beyond that was the extension by Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Juice? They're just making it, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It says here that "The moon is in the eighth house, which is very bad. The patient may not recover." Then he gives various planets which are also not well aligned. He says hospitals... He says the conjunction of another two planets is very bad. "Hospitalization and ill health are intensified in the present year. The days which are not good is when the moon passes in the 22nd to the 23rd of //nakṣatra,// which are 27th to the 28th of September," that's already passed, "the 24th to the 25th of October, then some days in November and December." He says, "//Sūrya// will apply for //Rahu// on Saturday, the 8th of October." That's today. This is very bad, this day. Today is Ekādaśī. "//Sūrya// will apply for //Rahu. Brashna, Lagnesh, Mangal,// in the eighth house. The medicine will not cure..., will not give any relief. The native will make a fight for life as //Sūrya-Mangal// are good friends, and Saturn, or //Śani,// and //Śukra// are enemies. There is no benefics in the nine, six, eleven and three. //Mangal// indicates the effects of //Śakini.// There is difficulty in recovery. The seventh //daśa// starts on the 13th of January, 1978." It says, "We have noticed that the periods are all negative until March-April 1978, and main trouble was due to //Śani.// We suggested that blue sapphire be tried, and he should keep it on. Hospitalization and travels are indicated." [background discussion while Brahmānanda checks calendar] Then he says the worst days of all for you are today and tomorrow. He says it is very negative, as well as the 11th, which is mixed. But these are all very inauspicious days. The 4th of October, the 5th of October, the 8th and 9th of October, and 11th of October. He says, "The only remedy in this case is to do //mahā-mṛtyum-jaya japa// and //havana.// Previously also, now also, we have recommended Śiva. Lord Śiva is the presiding Deity of //Śani,// and with this, the native will be able to overcome disease and life span increases."

**Hari-śauri:**
That's the //mantra// that he gave to me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Astrologically it is up to the eighty-one years, four months, approximately. Says, "//Japa// and //havana.//"

**Prabhupāda:**
Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is finished. So where is juice? You're asking him for juice.

**Hari-śauri:**
Where's Bhakti-caru, the juice?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Grape juice.

**Prabhupāda:**
You sit down and chant.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. I think that's why you're having difficulty this morning now also. These days now are very difficult. The only reason I felt to read this is that this man is not trying to make money. He did not charge anything. I didn't feel that he was simply doing it as a business.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is not prepared? And you were asking me if you can...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
When I asked you was... You took rest again, Śrīla Prabhupāda, so I couldn't make it at that time. We started it at the bathing time.

**Prabhupāda:**
How long it takes?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It shouldn't take this long. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
More. [pause]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[aside:] I'll arrange it in a minute with Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. I want to lie down.

**Hari-śauri:**
Come around this side of Śrīla Prabhupāda. I'm going to take these clothes away.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Do you want a little more juice? Sit you up for a minute just to drink this juice? You want some more now, or a little later?

**Prabhupāda:**
Later.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. [soft //kīrtana// starts] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
No luxuries. Live very simple life and you save time for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is my desire. Don't waste time for bodily comforts. You have got this body. You have to eat something. You have to cover yourself. So produce your own food and produce your own cloth. Don't waste time for luxury, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is success of life. In this way organize as far as possible, either in Ceylon or in Czechoslovakia, wherever. Save time. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Don't be allured by the machine civilization.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
This is soul-killing civilization, this kind of way of life, especially European countries. Anywhere you can inhabit it. It is not very difficult. A cottage; you can produce your own food anywhere. Am I right?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes, Prabhupāda. We will do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
And money, spend for Kṛṣṇa---for Kṛṣṇa's palace, for Kṛṣṇa's temple, for Kṛṣṇa's worship, gorgeous, as gorgeously as... Not for false... This is the human civilization. And to organize this, //varṇāśrama// will help you to divide the society---//brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya//---as there is division in the body. That will help. Don't waste human form of body for sense gratification. I wanted to introduce this. Now I have given you ideas. You can do it. You are all intelligent. For Caitanya Mahāprabhu's //para-upakāra.// So you do good to others, not exploit others. Any human being who has been bestowed by this body has the capacity to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Give them chance and make situation favorable. Is that clear?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes, it's clear, Prabhupāda. You have made everything very clear. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Passed stool.

**Haṁsadūta:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] [//kīrtana//]

**Prabhupāda:**
Nava-yogendra, organize Africa and South Africa. They are also gradually taking. So who is going there?

**Brahmānanda:**
Jayatīrtha.

**Prabhupāda:**
And Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa?

**Brahmānanda:**
No, not Toṣaṇa. In South Africa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Who took me to South Africa?

**Brahmānanda:**
Tulasī dāsa.

**Prabhupāda:**
No, before that, when I went.

**Brahmānanda:**
Oh, Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Try to bring him back. He is very competent. So jointly organize South Africa, both Europeans, Americans, Africans. Tulasī dāsa is very competent also.

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
United Nations under Caitanya Mahāprabhu's flag, do everywhere. It is possible. Always that is simply a false attempt. This is the real.

**Brahmānanda:**
You said that when you first came to New York. You went to the United Nations. The very first day I came to the //kīrtana// there in New York, the next day you went for that peace vigil outside the United Nations, and you were chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and saying that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only method for making United Nations.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is fact. //Āśraya lañā pāile, kṛṣṇa nāhi tāre tyaje, āra saba mare akāraṇa// [//Vaiṣṇava-mahimā//]. If we try under the protection of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, things will be successful. Others, they'll simply waste time and be disappointed and change his body and suffer. Today is Ekādaśī?

**Haṁsadūta:**
Today is Ekādaśī.

**Prabhupāda:**
Two songs especially, //Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu,// and Hare Kṛṣṇa //mahā-mantra,// should be continued as well as any song, especially, I mean to say, here in this room.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You want to drink something now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
When I shall want, you will give me //caraṇāmṛta.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We can give you some now. Would you like it now?

**Prabhupāda:**
I am not thirsty now. But //caraṇāmṛta,// little can be given also in the..., no harm. But don't take me to the hospital.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, Prabhupāda. Under no circumstance. Even if you are unconscious, we will simply chant.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I am quite all right here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That we can see.

**Prabhupāda:**
I came back from London on account of here in this hospital I... [microphone moves] Oh... Be very careful. [break] [//kīrtana//]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
So how many critical days he has...?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many what, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Critical days.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many critical days. Today, tomorrow, and then on the eleventh, three days from today. Today, tomorrow, then one day is not so bad, and then the next day after that becomes bad again.

**Prabhupāda:**
In this way how long prolong?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, those three days are the worst. Then the whole month is not very good. In fact, for another two or three months it's not very good. But these two or three days mentioned, they are very bad.

**Prabhupāda:**
And then again...?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Then there are some critical days in the following month. At the end of this month there's a couple of critical days, and then in the next month there's two or three, and in the following month there are some. The whole period is not very bright-looking.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think this program of //kīrtana// and just taking very little drink whenever you are thirsty, this is the right program, because I am seeing how peacefully you are resting, more than in many days. And now you should not struggle so hard. If Kṛṣṇa wishes, then He will do. We are prepared to stay here and sing for you for one year in a row.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's nice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It is our greatest pleasure to be with you and sing for you. Actually, I was thinking how your whole life is so perfect, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You have so many nice disciples, nice sons, and they are all gathered here to be with you, and everything is perfect by our chanting.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. More chanting.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Shall we chant some more?

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. [//kīrtana// starts---//Govindam// prayers]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't think you're feeling any pain. No. Are you thirsty at all? So today, tomorrow, those are critical days. And then one day lapse, and then another critical day. Generally the whole month is not very good. This month, next month, and one after, not very good. Of course, the best place to be is Vṛndāvana, and the best association is Kṛṣṇa's devotees, and you're under the protection of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. So there can't really be anything inauspicious in such a situation.

**Hari-śauri:**
...change the direction of Prabhupāda's bed.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? We were noticing that your bed is facing... [aside: Which way is it facing?] Your bed is facing more or less north. So we were wondering whether we should turn it to face east, which would be in the direction of the Deities, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. We could turn your bed just like this, as if we were turning you. We would keep you in the bed. We can pick up the bed and make it to face with your head towards Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma, which would be east. You have any objection? [aside:] This is north.

**Prabhupāda:**
There is no objection, but which is north?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
North is... You are now facing north, Śrīla Prabhupāda. No, your head is north. This way is south, and this way is north. So this way will be east, and this is the way of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. So if you like, we can face you east. I think you usually like to lie eastwards. See, 'cause we moved your bed in here it was like this. Otherwise, normally you sleep with your head that direction. Should we do that? We can move you right now. Then we'll chant some more? Okay. [break] Śrīla Prabhupāda, you want to see that Kṛṣṇa dāsa from Rādhā-kuṇḍa? The //pāṇḍā.// The man who takes people around. Not Kṛṣṇa dāsa..., not Niṣkiñcana Bābājī from Māyāpur.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That one, the one who always laughs a lot?

**Prabhupāda:**
Who comes to me.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Your Godbrother. Oh, you want to see him. Okay. I'll make sure that he comes. Śrīla Prabhupāda? You know how you were asking me about what those dates were? So I told you that today and tomorrow is difficult days. Then the day after that is not a difficult day, and it's also Govardhana-pūjā. Then the day after that becomes difficult again for one day. But the day in between, Govardhana-pūjā, is not considered to be a difficult day. [some discussion with Hari-śauri about dates] It's the wrong date, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's not Govardhana-pūjā. Our information was wrong. So we'll get Kṛṣṇa dāsa? Okay. [//kīrtana// starts] Śrīla Prabhupāda, have you been thinking about //parikrama?//

**Hari-śauri:**
[to //kīrtana//] Sshh.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[aside:] Let him chant.

**Hari-śauri:**
No, softly.

**Prabhupāda:**
Do you think in this stage is it possible?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I think it would be difficult. Better that we go //parikram-//ing around our temple, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma Mandira. That's a little easier. Don't you think that's better? If you get a little stronger, then it may be possible. That will depend on Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa dāsa, we should bring him here. Anyone else you want to see? Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja? Yes. We went to see him just to inquire about the necessary ceremony, and he gave us instruction. I sent Bhakti-caru Mahārāja and Bhakti-prema Mahārāja, and they wrote down everything. But Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja was very concerned. He said he's going to try and come to see you tomorrow. That's all right, isn't it? So Kṛṣṇa dāsa can be called for? Anytime? Okay. He stays at Rādhā-kuṇḍa? We'll inquire from the Gauḍīya... Does he stay at the Gauḍīya Maṭha here?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He does. In Vṛndāvana. Okay.

**Prabhupāda:**
Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja comes, then everything is all right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So if I call Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja, is there any need for Kṛṣṇa dāsa to come?

**Prabhupāda:**
He can arrange.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja. Yes, actually he wanted to do that. He gave us instructions, but he also wanted to take part. So better I call Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja than Kṛṣṇa dāsa? Okay. I'll send a car for him tomorrow morning. He was saying he was thinking to come tomorrow, so I'll send a car and say, "Prabhupāda requests if it's convenient that you can come this morning." That'll be all right? //Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]

**Bhāgavat:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
When you have come back?

**Bhāgavat:**
I just came just now, a half hour before, from America.

**Upendra:**
And he's real skinny, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He's skinny.

**Prabhupāda:**
Why?

**Bhāgavat:**
Because I am following //cāturmāsya.// I have reduced to 160 pounds. Before I was 260. Now I am 160.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very nice.

**Bhāgavata:**
Shall I chant?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [//kīrtana// begins] [Bengali conversation] Who is here?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Have //kīrtana.// So after my passing away, these, all the temples, they should receive some money for holding //utsava.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In your honor.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes, in the temple.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Prabhupāda.

**Gurukṛpā:**
//Jaya// Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is he?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Gurukṛpā Swami.

**Prabhupāda:**
Go on //kīrtana.// [//kīrtana// begins] [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Closed? Open? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali] [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
Bhavānanda? Prabhupāda said that somebody was saying that Bhavānanda was coming.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Bhakti-caru telegrammed to Bhavānanda and Jayapatākā and Śatadhanya Swami to come immediately. That all right? [break]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali conversation about wanting to see a //paṇḍit// from Caitanya Gauḍīya Maṭha and Kṛṣṇa dāsa bābājī]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He wants to see a //paṇḍitjī// from there. So can you get that //paṇḍitjī?// You want to see him tonight, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with Bhakti-caru] And Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja, he'll come tomorrow?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He'll come when we... Tonight could he come? You think that's too late?

**Bhakti-caru:**
I think he'll come, if we go and pick him up.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If we would pick him up, he might come tonight.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
If we go just now with the car, Bhakti-caru goes just now with the car, he may come tonight, Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Go on, //kīrtana.// [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Shall we put a little fan on? Little bit? [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] [Bengali conversation with Godbrothers, followed by //kīrtana, Śrī Rūpa Mañjarī Pada//] Where is Tamāla?

**Hari-śauri:**
Get Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. He's just coming, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He's in the other room.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali conversation]

**Hari-śauri:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. Tamāla Kṛṣṇa.

**Prabhupāda:**
You have consulted with Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. This morning Bhakti-caru Swami, Bhakti-prema Swami and Śrīdhara Swami went to see him, and Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja described the ceremony for the departure of a Vaiṣṇava, great Vaiṣṇava soul.

**Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali] ...entrance right side?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The entrance on the left side entering... Looking towards the Deity, it's the left side. In other words, when you come into the temple it's on left side. There's a big open area.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali conversation]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's on the same side as the //vyāsāsana.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Faces east.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Puṣpa, Māyāpure,// flower.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
To Māyāpur.

**Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja:**
[Bengali] You should call me, and I will come.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. He described the entire ceremony in detail, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So he knows. When we are ready[?], do it. [Bengali]

**Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja:**
[Bengali with Prabhupāda] You have fulfilled all, everything. [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Don't fight amongst yourselves. I have given the explanation, my will. Execute like that.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
And then everything will be... Kṛṣṇa will guide. Then what there is. [Bengali] Ekādaśī?

**Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja:**
Ekādaśī.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Mahāprabhu-sevā// [Bengali with Nārāyaṇa Mahārāja]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You'd like //kīrtana// now, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Haṁsadūta? [Haṁsadūta leads //Śrī-guru-caraṇa-padma//]

**Hari-śauri:**
Do you want your beads, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [end]
