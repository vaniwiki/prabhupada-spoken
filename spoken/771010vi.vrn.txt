====== Visit From Allopathic Doctor ======

**Doctor:**
[Hindi] That shows there is deficiency of vitamin B-complex. [Hindi]

**Bali-mardana:**
We have some.

**Doctor:**
[Bengali] So the vitamin deficiency is clear cut there. So unless something is done, only by watching and observation, that medically is not going to help.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is that something? What has to be done?

**Doctor:**
That I'll prescribe. Mahārājajī will be prepared to take some medicine... You like to take some medicine?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That's a good question.

**Doctor:**
If he agrees, I will suggest. I'll put it in a prescription form and explain to you how.

**Prabhupāda:**
Take it.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Give some paper and pen.

**Doctor:**
I think he would not like to receive any injection.

**Devotees:**
No.

**Doctor:**
And I won't advise further. Rather, it will be very cruel if I suggest.

**Prabhupāda:**
Without injection...

**Doctor:**
No. There will be, sir, no injection.

**Prabhupāda:**
It will be very nice. [laughter]

**Kīrtanānanda:**
You're just like a little boy, Prabhupāda.

**Doctor:**
Blood pressure should be checked up. Urine should be sent to the laboratory for examination.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Do you have these facilities available?

**Dr. Kapoor:**
He's in Agra, you see. He came here by chance for //darśana.// Only this morning Prabhupāda and I were talking that he should be called from Agra. Accidentally, when I went to bring the //vaidya,// I saw his car on the way. I stopped then.

**Doctor:**
I had my desire in my life to see him once, and that God has fulfilled.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Now you should see him a hundred times.

**Doctor:**
Hundred times, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with doctor] Bring Deity //prasādam.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We're bringing, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Doctor:**
Tablets... He likes syrup or tablets? Tablets will be difficult for swallowing?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What, Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Tablet I can take. [Bengali]

**Doctor:**
The tablets, [Bengali] they should be pure? [Bengali] enzymes?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Enzymes means animals.

**Doctor:**
[Bengali] without I will [Bengali].

**Bali-mardana:**
Syrup is better if the tablets are all made with animal... [Prabhupāda coughs] He's been having mucus.

**Doctor:**
For this cough, this will be a rather irritable thing to control. For that, Mahārājajī should have breathing exercise. Somebody must have suggested before also for breathing exercise?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, I don't think so.

**Doctor:**
It is necessary, because when he is bedridden there will be congestion in the base of the lungs. For that, for ten minutes morning, ten minutes afternoon, ten minutes evening, in this way exercise must be there. [Bengali]

**Hari-śauri:**
You want the spittoon, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Doctor:**
In old age it's very common for a patient to remain lying down in this posture.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Breathing exercises.

**Doctor:**
Breathing exercises as permanently done by. That will help. Then massage and change of postures after every two hours.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Change of?

**Doctor:**
Posture. Just as he is lying this way, he should lie on the latter side for some time just to have the circulation all over the body. And massage.

**Abhirāma:**
You were saying that there's a vitamin deficiency?

**Doctor:**
[Bengali] vitamin deficiency.

**Abhirāma:**
We have some, from America. We have some vitamin supplements.

**Doctor:**
Yes, you can give it.

**Abhirāma:**
In syrup form. Liquid form.

**Upendra:**
On the sides it tells the ingredients. Both sides.

**Doctor:**
Whether it is being given?

**Abhirāma:**
Not yet.

**Doctor:**
But it will only be effective if it is given. [laughter] So the problem is this.

**Abhirāma:**
But do you think it's a good idea? Do you recommend it?

**Doctor:**
Yes, it is a replacement, therapy. Whatever is not being assimilated and digested by the not taking any food, so this will be supplementary therapy, with this and other things. So this can be given, one teaspoonful three times a day.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
It is a harmless thing. Only vitamins. Nothing else.

**Doctor:**
It will supplementary therapy. Just to have... The body requires. That should be given in the form of food or in the form of medicine. [Bengali with Dr. Kapoor] [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Doctor:**
[writing] Neurovion syrup. Three times a day.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with Dr. Kapoor and doctor]

**Doctor:**
[Bengali] A tablespoonful two times a day after meals. A tablespoonful [Bengali]. Neurovion syrup, a teaspoonful two times a day, three---two combined. [Bengali] Now the tablet remains of [Bengali]. It is positively due to deficiency of proteins in the blood. [Hindi] But it should be given.

**Bali-mardana:**
He will have to agree to take it. You will have to agree to take it, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
He has agreed.

**Doctor:**
Unless the body requirements are met with it, the body cannot fight.

**Prabhupāda:**
What is that?

**Bali-mardana:**
This is what the devotees have brought from America.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
It's mostly soybean powder.

**Bali-mardana:**
It's similar to Complan except it has more protein.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
It's not made from milk, so there's less chance of mucus.

**Bali-mardana:**
Made of soybeans. It's a powder.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
[Bengali]

**Doctor:**
They are partially digested.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Oh, I see. //Ācchā.//

**Doctor:**
How much is the urine output?

**Upendra:**
More than he takes in, last few days.

**Doctor:**
It is measured? Urine is measured?

**Abhirāma:**
There's a record here.

**Upendra:**
Well these last few days have been very critical. He's been putting out more than he's taken in.

**Doctor:**
No, the quantity.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Tell him how much.

**Upendra:**
So far today, he's taken in 225 milliliters, and he's taken out..., take..., passing urine 200, 150.

**Abhirāma:**
Yesterday?

**Upendra:**
And yesterday he took in 350 and he passed 200. And the day before he took in 300 and passed out 290. The day before, took in 220 and passed out 250.

**Doctor:**
[Bengali] Instant protein.

**Upendra:**
You can't get it in India.

**Abhirāma:**
It's partially digested. Very good.

**Doctor:**
I want Prabhupāda to do nothing for edema. Edema will disappear he gains again strength. When he gains strength this swelling will disappear gradually.

**Upendra:**
Same thing the doctor said in London.

**Doctor:**
[Bengali] It is mainly a question of improving the appetite. And appetite will improve by appetizers. By appetizers I mean that whatever he has been liking before. The fruits or things should be as he likens. [Bengali] Salt is also necessary for body. Sugar is necessary for body. So even a complete salt-free diet for a very long period will produce this sort of weakness, because there is always perspiration in summer, and salt, there's loss of salt also from the body.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
He should take salt in some form.

**Doctor:**
In very small quantity that will improve appetite.

**Upendra:**
In the //mung// water there can be salt.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Anywhere.

**Abhirāma:**
Salt tablets?

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Vegetable juice.

**Doctor:**
That much is sufficient. There are three medicines.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Three syrups. One tablespoonful of each. Mix them. Mix it up.

**Doctor:**
No, it will bother. Better to take just one medicine and then after five minutes another medicine. So if all the three are taken together it will not be harm in mixing them. To mix them whole process once in morning, once in evening, after some food.

**Upendra:**
After some intake, yes.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Something, some juice or whatever he takes.

**Upendra:**
So that means these three medicines three times a day?

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Two times a day, after meals. After meals. Mix them up, the three syrups, mix them up, one tablespoonful each. And give three tablespoonfuls after meals, twice.

**Upendra:**
How soon after meal?

**Doctor:**
Just along with meal. While making up with it. Unless he feels tired, then of course, you can give it as a separate, separately. Otherwise just along with it, fruit juice.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
And does he take vegetable juice?

**Upendra:**
No.

**Doctor:**
Something must be given of his liking.

**Upendra:**
But Prabhupāda hasn't got any taste.

**Prabhupāda:**
Liking... [Bengali]

**Doctor:**
Does he like lemon?

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Lemon, can you take lemon?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [Hindi between Dr. Kapoor and doctor]

**Doctor:**
That you add one lemon with it.

**Upendra:**
In the fruit juice.

**Doctor:**
In the fruit juice. Lemon will improve appetite.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Fruit juice, put some glucose in it, thirty grams glucose, and one lemon.

**Upendra:**
And how much fruit juice should Prabhupāda take at one time?

**Doctor:**
That is according... Ad lib. As much as he likes. Because fluid intake is very necessary, whether it is water or fruit juice or in any way he likes. And regarding the treatment of the swelling, we can approach it scientifically only after the urine report. If there is nothing wrong with that, then some diet can be increased. And if there is something in urine or some other thing is present, then even then this much diet is a necessity; it must be continued.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
So what are the reports which must be kept regularly? Urine?

**Doctor:**
Blood pressure record once a week.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Once a week.

**Doctor:**
Urine output daily. [Bengali] Nothing else. [Bengali] What about motions?

**Upendra:**
Well, last few days nothing, because there was no intake. But otherwise...

**Abhirāma:**
The last motion we gave an enema, and he had a motion. About five days ago he took an enema.

**Doctor:**
Yes, that is right. If the motion is normal, normal motion is there, of course, nothing to be done. Otherwise after every four or five days or after a week, soap part enema or glycerin enema?

**Abhirāma:**
Glycerin.

**Doctor:**
Glycerin?

**Upendra:**
No, no. He's asking. Water.

**Doctor:**
Simple water, warm water. And that produces the effect? This is best, warm water.

**Upendra:**
Prabhupāda should be moved from side to side and sit up too.

**Doctor:**
That is... He must be... Posture must be changed after every two hours. Some massage of the body is necessity.

Dr. Kapoor: [Bengali] Water with milk or fruit juice.

**Doctor:**
Water with milk or fruit juice. Prabhupāda likes //mattha?// Whey?

**Abhirāma:**
Whey is good?

**Dr. Kapoor:**
But does Prabhupāda like it?

**Abhirāma:**
It can be used to mix these. We can use it instead of water?

**Doctor:**
Rather, it is a protein food,

**Abhirāma:**
It's protein?

**Doctor:**
Protein without fat. [Bengali] //Mattha// means when you serve the milk, milk or curd, you get whey. And that whey will be rather very easily digested. It will prevent the gases also and will be a supplement of protein.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Give in a small quantity first.

**Doctor:**
Small. See what is the response, how does he like it. [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Deity //prasādam.//

**Bali-mardana:**
Yes, it's right here, Prabhupāda.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
[Bengali]

**Upendra:**
Your wife has come? Your wife is here?

**Dr. Kapoor:**
[Bengali with doctor] You follow that now?

**Upendra:**
I can't... It's the doctor's handwriting.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Three syrups on the first page. One tablespoon...

**Doctor:**
[Bengali] Santivini. S-a-n-t-i-v-i-n-i. Santivini syrup. A tablespoonful two times after drink.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Each of these syrups is after meals twice a day.

**Upendra:**
And the other one is?

**Doctor:**
Digiplex. D-i-g-i-p-l-e-x. Digiplex. That is also one tablespoon.

**Prabhupāda:**
They have got it?

**Doctor:**
[Bengali]

**Upendra:**
What was the other syrup?

**Doctor:**
Neurovion syrup. N-e-u-r-o-v-i-o-n.

**Upendra:**
Neurovion syrup. Same. These can be had at any chemist?

**Doctor:**
Yes. I think it is available here.

Dr. Kapoor: Get at shop. Rama Medical Store.

**Doctor:**
If something is not available here, it can be got from Mathurā.

**Upendra:**
[trying to read prescription] "Fried...?" "Fried" something?

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Let me see it.

**Upendra:**
This one.

**Doctor:**
Proteins, high protein. Spoonful two times, with fruit juice or barley water.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
You will give glucose in fruit juice, and this also you'll give in fruit juice, so you can alternate.

**Abhirāma:**
He said how much glucose?

**Dr. Kapoor:**
In plain water also you can give glucose.

**Doctor:**
No, no. That will be a hurt. That will produce..., be producing hurt. Plain water... You are giving as plain water?

**Abhirāma:**
No, we're not giving plain water.

**Doctor:**
There's always a desire when a person feels thirsty he wants water. When he feels thirsty and you give him a drink, he will rather dislike it, and the appetite will disappear.

**Upendra:**
But Prabhupāda doesn't feel thirsty either.

**Doctor:**
[Hindi] That is all due to deficiency of the..., and ulcers of the mouth. They are there. They are in intestines...

**Dr. Kapoor:**
They are in the mouth and the intestines. That prevents...

**Abhirāma:**
Are you saying that juice is better than water?

**Doctor:**
Juice is juice, water is water.

**Abhirāma:**
But what about water? He should take water?

**Doctor:**
He has a liking for water, so the water should be given separately.

**Abhirāma:**
But not with glucose.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Not with glucose.

**Doctor:**
If he likes, with glucose it is all right. But if he has got a feeling of thirsty, thirsty feeling...

**Prabhupāda:**
But I have no.

**Doctor:**
No thirsty feeling?

**Prabhupāda:**
No desire for water.

**Doctor:**
Then it must not be given. Why? The water is a waste.

**Abhirāma:**
So then for nutrition, you said how much glucose per day?

**Doctor:**
Hundred grams at least, 100 to 150. And this you should give at least two tablespoonfuls in morning and two, three tablespoonful in the evening.

**Abhirāma:**
The vitamin supplement.

**Doctor:**
Yes, vitamin supplement.

**Abhirāma:**
And if he has some... If he is able to take some protein...

**Doctor:**
He does not like it or..., then you can stop it and you can give him whey.

**Abhirāma:**
Whey. That has a good amount of protein?

**Doctor:**
Small amount of protein. About... Protein percentage is about four percent or five percent. But this is a concentrated powder.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
//Ācchā.// [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Dr. Kapoor:**
You followed everything?

**Upendra:**
Yes. There should be some salt.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Yes.

**Upendra:**
And you can put...

**Prabhupāda:**
Direction.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
[Bengali] [break] [//kīrtana//]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. Did you call for me?

**Prabhupāda:**
What did you do with [indistinct] [break] [soft //kīrtana//]

**Śatadhanya:**
//...prasādam.// And they have //kīrtana.// They are so-called communists. Actually Bengalis are devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Simply that they know your name is enough to purify all of Bengal, what to speak of if you remain present, the whole world will become completely flooded by //kṛṣṇa-prema.// That is why we are begging you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you remain with us for some time longer, because we are very weak and are still attached to material sense gratification. But if you are present, it is like a transcendental ocean. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
There is some strain here. Yes. Why not make big or...?

**Upendra:**
You have some pain?

**Prabhupāda:**
Not pain, but veins straining.

**Upendra:**
Veins. Just here, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Bhakti-caru?

**Devotees:**
Just here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali about typesetting and printing]

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Bhavānanda?

**Devotee:**
Bhāgavat dāsa?

**Prabhupāda:**
Where is Bhavānanda?

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali] [break]

**Bhavānanda:**
It's just going... The Bengali //Gītā// is going out now for printing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Bengali //Gītā// with explanation.

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali with Bhakti-caru] Śatadhanya says that Bengalis, they like my book.

**Bhavānanda:**
Very much. We get huge amounts of mail.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Bhavānanda:**
We get huge amounts of mail from all over Bengal every day asking about different literatures that have been printed in Bengali by Your Divine Grace.

**Śrīdhara:**
[aside whispering] Turn over? On your back or on your side, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Upendra:**
Back.

**Śrīdhara:**
On your back?

**Upendra:**
Lift Prabhupāda up. You can push the pillow under his shoulders too. Is that all right? [break]

**Bhavānanda:**
...exactly where he stands. He told us that he's living in the middle of all of this. The villagers [indistinct]. He's completely surrounded by them. He is opportunist. But the Hṛṣīkeśa Mahārāja from Caitanya Maṭha, they are giving us support. But Saranga Babu is saying that...

**Indian man:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali conversation]

**Bhavānanda:**
President, Caitanya Maṭha.

**Indian man:**
Oh, I see. [Bengali] [break]

**Harikeśa:**
...praised //Īśopaniṣad.// This Yugoslavian professor is very famous.

**Prabhupāda:**
Famous?

**Harikeśa:**
We made it very scholarly, because I remember last time you said it should be very scholarly. We printed ten thousand copies of this.

**Prabhupāda:**
Selling?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes, we can sell these like anything, because in Yugoslavia we can pretend we're going to Greece, and we can bring as many as we like and then we can sell these.

**Prabhupāda:**
So why not print ten million?

**Harikeśa:**
I only had time to print ten thousand, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We did it in one day, from the flats to this book in one day, just so I could bring it to you. This is the //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Second Canto, First Volume, with Śrī-Śrī-Rādhā-London-īśvara. This we printed twenty thousand copies.

**Prabhupāda:**
Selling?

**Harikeśa:**
Oh, yes.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Which language?

**Harikeśa:**
This is German.

**Prabhupāda:**
Finely printed, everything first class.

**Harikeśa:**
This is //Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// Second Canto, Second Part.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Who is on the cover?

**Harikeśa:**
This is on the cover...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Rādhā-Govindadeva.

**Harikeśa:**
Rādhā-Govindajī from Jaipur. Very nice picture. On the back is this universal form.

**Prabhupāda:**
By seeing the picture they sell.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
People will buy just from seeing. [Prabhupāda laughs]

**Harikeśa:**
In Germany pictures like on the back, they're very popular.

**Prabhupāda:**
What price you are selling?

**Harikeśa:**
We sell these for about eight or nine marks or ten marks. That's somewhere between $3.50 and $4.00. Sometimes a little more.

**Prabhupāda:**
They pay that.

**Harikeśa:**
We've made on the covers the same gold stamp as in the American books, on this cover, and on the side also, for the libraries, because we are selling standing orders in German also. And here's Second Canto, Third Part, with Śrī-Śrī-Rādhā-Madana-mohana from Germany, from the Schloss.

**Jayatīrtha:**
These Deities are superexcellent Deities.

**Harikeśa:**
The //pūjārī,// he will not leave the temple under any circumstances, Aṣṭaratha dāsa. No matter what, he will not leave the temple. I tried to force him to come to London to see you. He said he cannot do it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Very good.

**Harikeśa:**
Then each of these is twenty thousand copies. Then we are making these //Kṛṣṇa// books. Of this book we printed sixty thousand copies.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How many?

**Harikeśa:**
Sixty thousand for mass distribution. There's very nice cover.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Wow. Look at Rāmeśvara. He jumped at that.

**Prabhupāda:**
He's defeated. [laughter]

**Harikeśa:**
I am just taking everything they do and do it. That's all. And then there is these other ones, volume two and three. We have printed 35,000 of each. This one has a very nice picture of you on the back.

**Rāmeśvara:**
Oh, yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Rāmeśvara Mahārāja, how do you like?

**Rāmeśvara:**
These books are very good. The most incredible thing, the printer can print them faster than anywhere else in the world. From the day he gives the book to the printer and the day the printer ships it, it is faster than anywhere else in the world.

**Harikeśa:**
The printer has invited all the BBT trustees from all over the world, and he will pay their fare, and he will say he will beat everybody's price in the whole world for printing.

**Prabhupāda:**
Then why not print there?

**Rāmeśvara:**
He wants us to go to do the research next month, in November.

**Prabhupāda:**
So go. If you get cheaper and nicer, why not?

**Rāmeśvara:**
We're planning to go and research it very carefully.

**Harikeśa:**
This is another part. This is also 35,000.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is the total number of volumes? Of these volumes, how much is the total printing of these seven books?

**Jayatīrtha:**
Two hundred thousand.

**Harikeśa:**
Er, I can't... Sixty thousand and 35, 35, 35, and 25. So that's...

**Yaśomatī-nandana:**
That's 190,000.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Plus 10,000 //Īśopaniṣads.//

**Rāmeśvara:**
In America just one book is 1,500,000 copies printed.

**Jayatīrtha:**
//Jaya// Rāmeśvara.

**Harikeśa:**
[laughs] We can't compete with...

**Rāmeśvara:**
But that was last year's. Next year we are planning to double it.

**Jayatīrtha:**
In America you are planning to double it. In Europe we are doubling it.

**Harikeśa:**
Right now we are laying out the Arabic //Bhagavad-gītā.// We're laying out the work. It's all composed.

**Rāmeśvara:**
//Haribol.//

**Harikeśa:**
And the Polish //Easy Journey...//

**Prabhupāda:**
He was rotting here, typewriting. I said, "You go." I had ten servants. You feel they are heavy.[?] He thought that I am degrading him. No. Now you understand?

**Harikeśa:**
Yes, I understand, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So here is a intelligent boy. Why he should rot here, typewriting? [break] Whatever deficiency are there, that is excused by Guru Mahārāja. Go on printing, go on printing. Deficiency will be corrected, next, next, next. I printed //Bhāgavata// in that way, so many defects. "All right. Whatever is printed, that's all." But these are first class. There is no defect. German printing is very pure. They have got the first-class machine. So we have got so many centers. Wherever cheaper and better printing can be gotten, we may take from there. That's all right. Thank you.

**Harikeśa:**
[choked voice] Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Jayatīrtha:**
Bhaktivedanta Book Trust //ki jaya.//

**Devotees:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda //ki jaya.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Harikeśa:**
Now you just have to become better, more healthy.

**Prabhupāda:**
Healthy... I have nothing to do with this body. Have to do with your work. Hmm. All right. [devotees offer obeisances] [break]

**Bhagavān:**
All the devotees want to give you a nice offering. So in three days, so far they have done almost eleven thousand big books. Marathon will end on Wednesday night, and they hope to do over twenty thousand big books in one week. We have about seventy-five devotees out distributing fourteen hours every day. They were thinking this was suitable offering for Your Divine Grace. Also in Italy they are doing almost 3,500 big books every week now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Rome.

**Bhagavān:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which book?

**Bhagavān:**
//Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,// First Volume. The devotees are thinking if they can do over twenty thousand big books in one week, you'll be encouraged to stay. And then they will do even more.

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī will give them blessing. He'll delay.[?] He wanted this.

**Bhagavān:**
When the book distribution is going on so strongly, everything is remaining very pure. It is taking away all inauspicious elements.

**Prabhupāda:**
Thank you. [//kīrtana//] [break] You can note down from him the crisis day.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You want me to get those dates? Tomorrow is one of them.

**Prabhupāda:**
There are so many.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Others come at the end of this month. I'll give him the dates. Tomorrow is the first one.

**Prabhupāda:**
I think every day is crisis. [laughs] Things becoming bad.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
You're not under the control of material nature, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Things becoming bad to worse. [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
Here's Bhavānanda.

**Prabhupāda:**
What arrangement is being made for the conference?

**Bhavānanda:**
Śatadhanya Mahārāja and I have formed the welcoming committee, and we're going to greet all of the guests when they come. We're having... The guesthouse will be empty tonight and cleaned up and all arrangements made for their stay there. That's as much as I've been able to do to date, because I don't know what Svarūpa Dāmodara has done. That's all I'm able to find out. There was nothing done as far as that goes---greeting the people and seeing that their living arrangements are made. They've made a temporary kitchen over in the //gurukula// building for cooking, and we're seeing that the //prasādam// is... We're going to go over the menu, that that is all nice and nicely served. I'm waiting for...

**Prabhupāda:**
And what about the conference place?

**Bhavānanda:**
The conference place is being cleaned up now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Which room?

**Bhavānanda:**
On the ground floor in the front, the conference room? They had a big conference room there?

**Hari-śauri:**
That was going to be the bank.

**Bhavānanda:**
Right. That's being cleaned now, and that will be all ready. So everything is going on.

**Prabhupāda:**
When the conference begins?

**Bali-mardana:**
The invitation says nine, but Mādhava dāsa said about ten. Friday at 10:30.

**Hari-śauri:**
In the morning begins. Today is Wednesday.

**Bali-mardana:**
Wednesday. So I'm waiting for Svarūpa Dāmodara to come to see what other details have to be taken care of, and then we'll immediately see that it's... The greeting committee will be Śatadhanya Mahārāja, myself, Subhaga, and some other boys to see that they're..., if the //prasādam...// As far as the conference and lecture, that's all in Svarūpa Dāmodara's hands. I have nothing... But as far as the arrangements for the guests and their living facilities and //prasādam,// that I'll take care of. [break]

**Brahmānanda:**
...some Swahili books Cyavana Swami has produced. This is the //Topmost Yoga.// We had printed this a couple of years ago. This is a reprint. //Ufahamawa[?] Kṛṣṇa.// The money for this printing was donated to us by Harikeśa Swami, his German //yātrā.//

**Hari-śauri:**
You printed in Africa?

**Brahmānanda:**
Yes. And this is a magazine, //Rudiwawumungu//[?] It means "Go back to God." //Mungu// is "God." That says "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa."

**Upendra:**
They have letters explaining what each of the..., beads means, //tilaka,// clothes---explanation down here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Brahmānanda:**
To distribute these books Cyavana Swami is having African devotees distribute them. He is organizing them. Cyavana Swami is good at organizing the Africans. But we are not able to distribute them for the cost, for what it cost to print.

**Prabhupāda:**
It doesn't matter.

**Brahmānanda:**
What is that?

**Hari-śauri:**
Doesn't matter.

**Brahmānanda:**
Doesn't matter. Yes. Therefore we have to get... I've asked at the BBT that some fund, if we could set up some fund... We have published in the books that "This is donated to the people of Kenya by ISKCON Frankfurt, West Germany." So he is getting a good advertisement also, that he is sending money out of the country for welfare purposes. [break]

**Hari-śauri:**
Prabhupāda's having a lot of mucus this morning.

**Dr. Ghosh [of Kodaikanal]:**
Not eating anything.

**Hari-śauri:**
Only liquid. Some fruit juice and little glucose and grape juice, a little bit. Previously he was taking Complan as well.

**Upendra:**
He had milk last night. The //vaidya// recommended milk. He had some milk last night, and this morning he had some orange juice. Then the mucus came, after orange juice.

**Dr. Ghosh:**
When he went to London he was better?

**Upendra:**
No.

**Jayatīrtha:**
No. First few days I think he was better.

**Dr. Ghosh:**
When did he come back from London?

**Hari-śauri:**
Thirteenth of September, it was about a month ago.

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali]

**Dr. Ghosh:**
No improvement. You went with him, no?

**Bhakti-caru:**
No, I didn't go.

**Dr. Ghosh:**
Bombay, you took. No improvement. But he was better here.

**Bhakti-caru:**
What do you think?

**Upendra:**
He was better when he was last here.

**Dr. Ghosh:**
Eating something.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Little bit then.

**Dr. Ghosh:**
Does he ask for food?

**Upendra:**
No

**Dr. Ghosh:**
Never. You are giving nothing except coconut water and these Horlicks.

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali]

**Dr. Ghosh:**
[Bengali]

**Hari-śauri:**
This is a record of what Prabhupāda's been taking the last few days.

**Jayatīrtha:**
The cc's, the urine and the intake, what he was taking. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Did you send telegram to this doctor?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dr. Ghosh?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dr. Ghosh.

**Hari-śauri:**
Is he... He's in the back? Prabhupāda's saying did you send a telegram.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I sent him a letter, I think.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is in Allahabad. He [the Dr. Ghosh present] is coming from Kodaikanal.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, we never sent him a telegram. Maybe someone else sent him a telegram, like, what's that boy? Ikṣvāku? I wouldn't be surprised if he might have done it.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
One of Haṁsadūta's men has been living... Well, I have to speculate, because he's the only one who's..., he's been living there. One of Haṁsadūta's men has been living in Kodaikanal with this Dr. Ghosh. Perhaps he... I'm saying perhaps. I don't know. I had no contact with the man.

**Prabhupāda:**
I said you don't ask him about anything.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, this Ikṣvāku is crazy. He's crazy. I can find out if that's how he found out, but I suspect that's what it is. He's very difficult, that devotee. 

**Hari-śauri:**
You'd better ask him how he came.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'll be able to find out. I can't... There's no other way he could have possibly come, except through Ikṣvāku.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who is he?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This Ikṣvāku? He's a German devotee who has been living in Kodaikanal with Dr. Ghosh. He's a little crazy.

**Abhirāma:**
Independent.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Very independent. I'm speculating. I'm going to have to investigate, but perhaps after coming here he sent Dr. Ghosh a telegram saying that your condition is very critical and that he should come. Because otherwise there's no possible way I could think of that Dr. Ghosh would have come here. No way. We have no communica... I would never communicate. We already had our business with him four or five months ago. Oh, yeah. We already rejected him.

**Kīrtanānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? It's Kīrtanānanda. It seems that someone has to be in charge of your care. One day it's this allopath, one day this quack, that quack. That's not good. I'd like to see you ask one of us--- I'll be glad to do it; anyone---take charge of your care, and we can do the best we can. But just one thing, one thing...

**Prabhupāda:**
But we have already asked Dr. Ghosh of Allahabad, but he has not come.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, he hasn't. We received a letter from him. I think he may have missed our letter, but he said that any correspondence should be sent to Allahabad and would be forwarded to him.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He said that any correspondence that we sent to him would be forwarded. But he hasn't come yet.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can see that letter. He is qualified man.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He suggests immediately that Prabhupāda go into a hospital.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dr. Ghosh's letter, you remember, he suggests that we immediately take you to that Bombay hospital.

**Hari-śauri:**
He wanted to do that last March when he saw you there at Māyāpur.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That was his opinion.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can show him bile. Show him the bile. [end]
