====== Room Conversation ======

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, Acyutānanda Mahārāja has come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Here?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Acyutānanda Mahārāja.

**Prabhupāda:**
Here. Where you are preaching now?

**Acyutānanda:**
I was in Calcutta during the Māyāpur affairs. Then I went to South India. Now I'm going to America. My stay in India may be terminated. And I received American passport. I'm able to travel now. Rāmeśvara Prabhu is sending me a ticket.

**Prabhupāda:**
Huh? Rāmeśvara?

**Bhavānanda:**
Rāmeśvara Mahārāja is sending a ticket for him to go.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh. So you can go now, America, eh?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes.

Acyutānanda: Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
That's good. You attended the conference?

**Acyutānanda:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
You liked?

**Hari-śauri:**
You liked it?

**Acyutānanda:**
Oh, yes. It was very successful. One scientist has actually been touched. His heart is changed, Dr. Ramaya. He, in fact, defended our one point with one other scientist.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[indistinct aside with Hari-śauri] You are ready for bathing, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. [end]
