**Pañca-draviḍa:**
Just like these //gurukula// kids. You have also taught us even how to dress ourself.

**Jayādvaita:**
And you brought us to Vṛndāvana, richest place.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda and Bhakti-caru]

**Prabhupāda:**
If he likes, he can come.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. We don't have to invite him to come. He knows you're here. So he should come of his own accord if he wants. Okay.
