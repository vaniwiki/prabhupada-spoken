====== Room Conversation With Shri Narayan and Ramkrishna Bajaj ======

**Shri Narayan:**
But are you feeling better, Swāmījī?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Little, little.

**Shri Narayan:**
Little better.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi]

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Therefore always two attendants, and they are taking care. Otherwise personally I would not...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, please sit down. It's all right. It's here for you to sit, so you can...

**Shri Narayan:**
I don't want you to talk loudly.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So you sit down.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You can sit here.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
I'm very glad to see you here. [Hindi with guests] So, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who has got these films, you can...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. I'm going to arrange it with Akṣayānanda Mahārāja. The temple has everything here.

**Prabhupāda:**
Call Akṣayānanda Mahārāja.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All right.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Just see our activities all over the world.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi]

**Ramkrishna Bajaj:**
[Hindi]

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi with Prabhupāda]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] South Africa. Is it not South Africa?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] Why don't you show them the South African report?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] ...slaughterhouse... [Hindi conversation]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is a temple that was built there. We have a big farm there as well as two temples. This is one of the temples.

**Shri Narayan:**
Where in South Africa? Natal?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Near Durban.

**Shri Narayan:**
Near Durban. //Ācchā.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And they had fifteen thousand people attending at the Janmāṣṭamī celebration. Here you see some //go-pūjā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] Without culture they're suffering. If you want to mitigate their sufferings, give this //Gītā// culture.

**Shri Narayan:**
//Gītā// culture.

**Prabhupāda:**
Oh, yes. That is my experience. [Hindi] We have sold this //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// even in Russian countries.

**Shri Narayan:**
Russian countries.

**Bhakti-caru:**
This is //Caitanya-caritāmṛta// in seventeen volumes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here are some of our African publications, Śrīla Prabhupāda, published in Swahili.

**Prabhupāda:**
African, Chinese, Japanese.

**Shri Narayan:**
Russian... [Hindi] ...Communist country...

**Prabhupāda:**
This is really humanitarian.

**Ramkrishna Bajaj:**
[Hindi conversation about temple and //darśana//]

**Prabhupāda:**
When I go for //parikramā?//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Eight-thirty in the morning, generally. Then all of the participants can have //darśana// of Śrīla Prabhupāda, and we also have the //darśana// of the Deities at that time.

**Shri Narayan:**
Deity also. [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] ...so we can influence whole world.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? We got report that the recent printing of the //Bhagavad-gītā// will be sold out by June. One million five hundred thousand copies will have been sold in about ten months' time. Fifteen //lakhs// were sold in ten months just in the United States.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Bhakti-caru:**
Seventeen volumes, //he, Caitanya-caritāmṛta,// English translation.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi] How many? Fifty...

**Bhakti-caru:**
How many sets?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Standing orders was..., I think it was three thousand standing orders.

**Prabhupāda:**
Three thousand or five thousand... [Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:**
Twenty-four //lakhs.//

**Prabhupāda:**
Three thousand eight hundred.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi conversation]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Three thousand at fifty rupees each.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Eight hundred rupees a set times three thousand.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Eight hundred rupees a set times three thousand.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi conversation] //...Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...// [Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:**
//Daśama skanda// [Hindi conversation with guests]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi conversation] I increased my duration of life according to horoscope [Hindi conversation] ...this feeble condition.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi conversation)

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here is Akṣayānanda Mahārāja, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ah, Akṣayānanda Mahārāja...

**Akṣayānanda:**
Yes, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
The film and... What happened to...?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yeah, they would like to have a...

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi] //...kīrtana...// [Hindi]

**Akṣayānanda:**
We would be very happy. [Hindi with guests]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with guests and Indian lady guest] I do not know. What..., what happened to the Hindu...?

**Shri Narayan:**
What is the latest about the Bombay temple [Hindi]?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We haven't heard anything in the last two or three months, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This telegram came from the former mayor---Ganatra? Rajiv Ganatra? He wrote, "Pray God to give you long life to spread Indian culture in every nook and corner of the universe."

**Ramkrishna Bajaj:**
[Hindi] That is the feeling of all, everybody.

**Shri Narayan:**
[Hindi with Prabhupada and lady guest]

**Prabhupāda:**
That is Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa. //Ye yathā māṁ prapadyate// [[books:bg:4:11|[Bg. 4.11]]]. [Hindi conversation] //Para-upakāra.// This is the mission of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, //para-upakāra.// Especially those who have taken birth in India...

> bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra
> janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra
> [[books:cc:adi:9:41|[Cc. Ādi 9.41]]]

[Hindi] This is Indian culture, //para-upakāra.// Indian culture is not meant for exploiting others. //Para-upakāra.// That is human life, //para-upakāra.// And that is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. Bhārata, especially... [Hindi; Indian guests leave for //darśana//] //Jaya.//

[//kavirāja// enters]

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-caru and Prabhupāda, as Bhakti-caru explains about Prabhupāda's symptoms]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It's going down.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-caru and Prabhupāda]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The main thing we saw today, Prabhupāda passed more urine than ever before, and very clear-colored.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-caru]

**Bhakti-caru:**
The telephone is out of order. He was wondering...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Whether we got the reservations or not.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-caru]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is that?

**Bhakti-caru:**
Said Prabhupāda shouldn't speak so much.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Phew. Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja//]

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja// explaining who guests were]

[whispering in background]

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi about progress]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Slowly but surely.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja//] Impossible.

**Bhakti-caru:**
[chuckling] He's saying it's impossible, that he had cough today, and tomorrow there is no sign of it. So these are all Śrīla Prabhupāda's pastimes, his own doings.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi with Bhakti-caru]

[whispering in background]

**Bhakti-caru:**
In the morning you have to save the urine. [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Which time? The latest possible one.

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja//]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
'Cause he passes urine sometimes two times in the morning, or three.

**Bhakti-caru:**
For last few days, at times he's passing at four o'clock and then again at about six o'clock.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So which one of those two?

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja//] //Gītā// conference... [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Gītā Pratiṣṭhāna. Big conference. Two days. Two-day conference.

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Hindi] Where is the conference?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
It will be in the //gurukula// building at two o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

**Bhakti-caru:**
[explains in Hindi]

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi---talks about medicine] Doctor as well [referring to Svarūpa Dāmodara].

Bhakti-caru: Ha, he's a doctor. Physics.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Chemistry.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Oh, chemistry. [Hindi] Śrīla Prabhupāda? [Hindi]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi] //...bhavauṣadhi...// [Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, you also ate a little bit of vegetable, and you said there was a little taste today, I think. [to Svarūpa Dāmodara] You can tell him. Some vegetable.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes, he said. [Hindi] 500 cc, urine.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The Āyurvedic science is very perfect. But the difficulty is that until now we could not find a doctor who understood the science.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What did he say?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
He said that the difficulty is to make the medicine. It takes time and...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes, that's...

**Kavirāja:**
Kidney, it is special.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
It is for kidney, special.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[looking at medicine] Phew. What is it made from? What is that made from? Śrīla Prabhupāda, Shastrijī has made very nice medicine for you---very, very nice. What is that from?

Kavirāja: [Hindi] Twenty-two.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Twenty-two ingredients.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Distilled.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi] Distilled water.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No one will take the time anymore these days. How is it given? How is this given?

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Drink. One dose. One, once.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Phew. This is the science. This is real medicine. It took him seven, eight hours, twenty-two ingredients distilled. He has to distill the water first. Twenty-two ingredients. It's very nice, isn't it.

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? [Prabhupāda drinks medicine]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Hindi with //kavirāja//]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is for the kidneys?

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi] //Vṛkka-sañjīvanī.// [Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:**
//Vṛkka. V-r-i-k-k-a.//

**Kavirāja:**
Urdu. [Hindi]

**Bhakti-caru:**
The Sanskrit name for kidney is //vṛkka.//

**Kavirāja:**
//Vṛkka-sañjīvanayarak.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Vṛkka-sañjīvanī-aya//

**Bhakti-caru:**
No, //sañjīvanī-araka. Araka// means extract, and //sañjīvanī// means...

**Kavirāja:**
[Hindi]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What does that mean? Extractive.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Yes. Extract, to revitalize the kidney. No, our medicine for revitalizing the kidney. [Hindi with Prabhupāda]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like a little soft //kīrtana?//

**Prabhupāda:**
No. Now let me take rest.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Take rest. Okay, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [end]
