====== Room Conversation ======

**Prabhupāda:**
Resting. [Bengali with Dr. Kapoor]

**Dr. Kapoor:**
[whispered aside] Still too weak, huh? Can hardly speak.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. He can't speak, actually. Resting is good in this case. Best thing. Maybe I can read some nice news, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Would you like that? This is a very nice report, Śrīla Prabhupāda, from Peru. Dr. Kapoor said anyone would fall in love with it at first sight. [laughter] Pañca ought to see the Tenth Canto. This is a new edition of Tenth Canto that has just come out.

**Bhakti-caru:**
Fifteen pictures.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You'll find some illustrations at the very beginning. Starting here.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
I think you have excelled all other publishers in this art. [laughs]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
These are Spanish publications. We were just reading. These are the books that they were distributing, that they were talking about---//Kṛṣṇa// book in Spanish, three parts. There's also some Spanish nectar that came. Do we have any?

**Upendra:**
It's in the other room, I think.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Which other languages have you translated Prabhupāda's books in? French?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Well, there's I think twenty-seven languages. French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, Swedish...

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Oh. All the books are translated?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No. Gradually, one by one. This is Dvārakeśa. He's in charge of the translating department for East Europe. Which languages do you translate?

**Dvārakeśa:**
Russian and Hungarian. And others translate into Yugoslavian and Polish, Czechoslovakian.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He has preached in some of those countries already.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
Now //Bhagavad-gītā// in Arabic also, isn't it?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Arabic, Chinese, Japanese. Twenty-seven languages altogether. One by one, they're being translated. Some are doing... Of course, the German, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, these are the main languages. And Hindi. These books are going quicker in translation.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
[Bengali]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Shall I finish reading this report, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break]

**Dr. Kapoor:**
It's a miracle that is happening, Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
There's another report, from Africa. Should I read it? It says, "The //saṅkīrtana// movement in the dark continent."

**Devotee:**
Who wrote that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This was written by Jalakāra and Śyāmalāl. Śyāmalāl is a Bengali devotee, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You may remember him from Calcutta? He's gone to Africa to preach, and he and this other boy, Jalakāra, travel together all over Africa.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yesterday... No, yesterday some prominent men, Dalmia. Who came?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dalmia was here, Ramkrishna Bajaj, Shriman Narayan, and some gentleman from Auroville Society was here to see you. I think they were participating in that conference, Gītā-pratiṣṭhāna.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
I was also invited. I'm sorry I couldn't come, because my wife was very ill.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Dr. Kapoor could not attend. His wife was very ill, he said. He couldn't attend the conference. Śrīla Prabhupāda, maybe you should rest now a little bit.

**Dr. Kapoor:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay.

**Bhakti-caru:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
I'm tired.

**Bhakti-caru:**
//Ācchā.//

Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: [whispering] Tell him it will be good for him.

**Bhavānanda:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? Would you like to take some nice pomegranate juice? Very good for you. [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Any difficulties?

**Prabhupāda:**
Everything difficult.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is a gradual recovery, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We can't expect suddenly that overnight there will be recovery. I feel finally that we've understood a little bit what has been the difficulty. I really think this //kavirāja// has had a little understanding like that. And you know, I think that this Āyurvedic medicine can effect a gradual change for the better. Let us try. We're trying now. We're patient, and if you'll be patient also, then I think we'll see a good change. Is that all right?

**Prabhupāda:**
What can be done?

**Jagadīśa:**
Do you feel better, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, not yet.

**Jagadīśa:**
Any more strength?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
No, the strength is not supposed to come yet. You shouldn't expect strength yet, because strength can't come unless you eat. There's no reason for him to feel strong, because he isn't eating yet. The //kavirāja// explained that in order for Prabhupāda to eat, first of all the liver and the kidneys have to be properly healed. Then automatically there will be appetite. And if there's appetite, then Prabhupāda will eat. [pause] [end]
