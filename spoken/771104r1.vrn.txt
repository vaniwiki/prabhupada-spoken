====== Room Conversation ======

[Hindi or Bengali conversations]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
So, that legal business?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Girirāja has gone into Mathurā to meet with Mr. Garg to just see that all of the drafts are in order, if everything is in order. Then hopefully tomorrow we can finish it all.

**Prabhupāda:**
So it was argument, not that we have rejected. //Upāyān cintayet prajñāḥ.//

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You mean the treatment? Yes, I have learned to take everything very philosophically, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I mean I took it that you were presenting the..., you know, presenting the whole picture to be considered.

**Prabhupāda:**
I am now puzzled. Still, I am thinking.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I thought it was very good what you said, in the sense that it... It actually makes everything... It presents a more real picture. We should not be overly optimistic, neither should we be completely fatalistic.

**Prabhupāda:**
No.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
And above all, our whole program here is completely transcendental. I mean, it's just like Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī said. Your consciousness is so sublime that it's just wonderful at every moment to be with you. I mean, although I wish that you were... We all wish that you were completely healthy, yet at the same time we have never experienced so much nice exchanges with you. I mean, we all... Every moment is so relishable to be with you. So I mean, even this puzzlement is very transcendental. None of us see any of this in any kind of a mundane view. It's all due to your consciousness being so Kṛṣṇa conscious, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I mean to me this puzzlement is simply another proof of the existence of Kṛṣṇa, 'cause Kṛṣṇa certainly is not puzzled. It seems like everything is happening according to His plan.

**Prabhupāda:**
//Kīrtana// may be stopped now.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Stop for a while now. I think for the rest of the night it's good if there's... [//kīrtana// stops] The //kavirājī// assistant came this evening. We hadn't called him. I think he came on his own. He wanted to see how you were. I didn't think there was so much need for him to see you. He's not so senior a man. And the medicine is already prescribed, so what would be the benefit of his coming? We're not going to allow him to change the medicine, so I felt there was no real need. We can... Bhakti-caru Mahārāja spoke with him, gave him report of how you are.

**Prabhupāda:**
He is also educated?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I don't really know, Śrīla Prabhupāda, how far he's educated.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Seems too young also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Young and... We're pretty lucky, as far as I can see, with that Damodar Prasad Shastri. I mean he seems to be in his own category from all the //kavirājas// I've ever seen. He really seems different than that.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
He's also Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He really is a little Kṛṣṇa conscious.

**Prabhupāda:**
Who?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
That... The //kavirāja// that we brought from Calcutta. He's... The thing I liked about him also is I felt that he was the kind of person who I... Somehow I felt that in your childhood or something, that your family would have engaged some such a Marwari... You always said how the Mulliks' house was located amongst many Marwari community people. I was thinking somehow it seemed suitable that this is... Of course, we don't designate like that, but somehow it seems suitable that..., you know. The Marwaris are... They occupy a high place in the community. Everything they do, they do very first class. Their food is first class. They do first-class business. Most of our members are from the Marwari community. Anyway, it just seemed like it was nice that this man...

**Prabhupāda:**
Their food is first class, there is no doubt.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The Marwari food.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. It is certified by Sir P. C. Raya.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
By who, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
A big chemist.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What was his name?

**Prabhupāda:**
Sir P. C. Raya.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
P. C. Raya.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
P. C. Raya.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
A chemist, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yes. He's the first chemist who started this Bengal Chemical.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. He said first-class food is Marwari, and last class, Madrasi.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Madras.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Last class?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
The Madrasi.

**Pañca-draviḍa:**
They cook very bad. I like this doctor too, Śrīla Prabhupāda, because he was respectful to you.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Not only to Prabhupāda---they're always respectful to Prabhupāda---But that he was respectful to the devotees. That was the sign that actually he was respectful to Prabhupāda, because many of them, they show respect to Śrīla Prabhupāda, but they don't respect the devotees, which means they don't really respect what Śrīla Prabhupāda has done. He had a very good appreciation. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
I had some stool.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Earlier today. That also, I see by the writing, was good color. Actually, that's a good sign, that it's being passed naturally, without any artificial means. You may be feeling relief from that.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. The stool which I was proposing came out by juice.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Came out naturally.

**Prabhupāda:**
That is good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. Did Prabhupāda have barley and milk tonight?

**Bhakti-caru:**
No, I got it ready. I just came to ask. Śrīla Prabhupāda? [Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Now you can go.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. I'm always nearby. I'm in the house all the time. //Jaya// Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] [end]
