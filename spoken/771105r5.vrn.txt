====== Room Conversation ======

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...notarized copies of everything. This registrar was not the real registrar. He's only a clerk. The registrar is on leave. So because this man is not so experienced, it takes a little extra time to do everything with him. So Girirāja and I have had a little bit of experience, so we had to teach him some things. Now everybody understands clearly. Everything is now completed. Your signatures were quite good, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Your signatures were not bad.

**Prabhupāda:**
This thing? What is that?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Your signatures were fairly good. Some of them were very good. They remarked that the signature was strong... [break] I tried to make it as quick as possible. Now I have the receipts, and I will keep them locked in the almirah just like we did last time. And after about one week we'll be able to get the original documents after they've been registered. In the meantime, on Monday we're going to open up a bank account in the name of Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust in Punjab National Bank, New Delhi. Girirāja, who is the secretary of the Trust, and Bhavānanda Mahārāja, who are the treasurers, will open the account. So the interest from the fixed deposits will go directly into that account. Is that nice? That was your idea. And the bank will be happy that we're keeping the money in their bank. All of your plans are perfect, Śrīla Prabhupāda. And our perfection is simply to carry them out without changing in any way. You have such complete plans that we don't have to do anything new. We have to work our whole lifetime simply to carry out what you've planned. Even then we won't be able to complete everything. We'll have to trust to those who come after us to finish everything. So I'll just finish everything now with them, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and lock everything away, and then I'll come back. I don't want to leave Girirāja alone. It's nice to do everything together, two. I'll come right back afterwards. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
The Trust deed somebody may read.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, yes. I can bring it just now.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I can read it to you personally.

**Prabhupāda:**
All right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. [break]
