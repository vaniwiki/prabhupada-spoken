**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Prabhupāda's requesting here. He said it's better if we do it here. So he said, "Make all the arrangements necessary."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He wants to bring the //brāhmaṇas// to inaugurate the Bombay temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
That we shall consider later.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
'Cause we already told these South Indian //brāhmaṇas// to come.

**Prabhupāda:**
Some of them may go also.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Do you know this man from a long time ago?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He wants some money for some temple?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. Now stop talking. [long pause] [break] You have given him ten rupees?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Ah, Prabhupāda. To that //brāhmaṇa?//

**Girirāja:**
Yes. He gave ten rupees.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Tamāla gave ten rupees?

**Girirāja:**
Yes. Śrīla Prabhupāda? Would you like soft //kīrtana// now, or quiet?

**Prabhupāda:**
You were reading something?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
No.

**Upendra:**
He's talking to Tamāla.

**Girirāja:**
Oh, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. He's... [break] Yesterday I spent the day in Delhi, and I opened an account with the Punjab Bank in the name of Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust. And we also gave them a letter that the interest from the ten //lakhs// sixty thousand should go into that Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity account. And I took the original trust of the new trust, the original deed, and I made some photocopies and got them notarized by notary.

**Prabhupāda:**
Photocopy of?

**Girirāja:**
Of the trust deed forming the Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust. And then I bought a copy of the income tax act, because there's some provision that if funds are used to restore some ancient place of worship or some place of worship which is famous in a particular state, then that is exempt from income tax. So I think that this fits in with the aims and objects of this new trust. So we should be able to get tax exemption for that. Then I spoke to Bombay to see how things were doing, and Gopāla Kṛṣṇa said that everything is going nice, and he's coming here on Friday, after two days. So I told him that your condition was very serious and that I wanted to stay here for a little longer. So he said that was okay. I confirmed with Yaśodānandana Swami's assistant that he sent the letter to the South Indian //brāhmaṇas// to confirm that they can come on the dates which we have fixed. So we're waiting to hear that reply.

**Prabhupāda:**
You can take some //brāhmaṇa// from here. Balaram...

**Girirāja:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
They'll chant //Veda-mantra// very nice.

**Girirāja:**
Uh-huh. We can have these //brāhmaṇas// and also the South Indian //brāhmaṇas.// [break] [end]
