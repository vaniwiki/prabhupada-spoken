====== Room Conversation ======

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...three days till you get a little more strength. I mean this is a very good sign, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You've taken a half a kilo of milk. No mucus, no stool. If you get a few days of strength... I mean, I have no objection even tomorrow to take you. I just would like to hear what the //kavirāja...// I really have a little faith on him. I mean I have all faith on you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I have only a little faith on him, but I don't want to reject his advice as a doctor. This //kavirāja// is giving sound advice so far.

**Prabhupāda:**
Where he is?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We're just trying to get him here. He went out again to get some more medicine for you. He says now that he's seen that you took this half kilo of milk he's going to start to give a medicine that will make this milk make muscles on your body, because all the muscles have become finished, slackened. So he wants to do that so that you'll then have strength. Parikramming the temple is not so bad. Let's just see what he says. It's certainly not that difficult. The main thing is, you have to be able to sit up for some time. [aside:] Prabhupāda wants to become enlivened spiritually, you know, by some spiritual activity. [to Prabhupāda:] We'll ask the //kavirāja// if he thinks we can take you tomorrow for a short //parikramā// around the temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Hmm? That would be good.

**Anudeśa[?]:**
I was asking him for medicine. He just got on the phone. I talked to him.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He's coming back?

**Anudeśa[?]:**
Yes. He asked if the //kavirāja// has come, [indistinct] medicine. I said he's coming right back. He's very happy.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I told him... I couldn't believe that... I felt so bad, seeing him tonight. He was sitting, Śrīla Prabhupāda, on the fountain steps, completely dejected. Couldn't understand why. He just was so, so disappointed and unhappy. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[Bengali; mentions milk, //miṣṭi//]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda, the way you deal with us simply deepens our attachment every moment.

**Prabhupāda:**
It is my duty. [laughter] There was a professor in Scottish Churches' College. So when you would say something, he would reply, "That's my juti," "juti," j-u-t-i. [chuckles] So there was a student, he said... So he said, "Is that Scottish pronunciation?" [laughter] [pause] [break]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What would you like, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Pass urine.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay. [break]

**Prabhupāda:**
...properly fixed up?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is it properly fixed up, Prabhupāda wants to know?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. All right. [pause]

**Bhavānanda:**
Finished, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
About 40 cc's, Śrīla Prabhupāda.

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm. [Bengali with Bhakti-caru]

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[Bengali] [Bengali conversation continues for some time] [temple bell sounds 9 times]

**Jayapatākā:**
[Bengali with Prabhupāda and Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Are you comfortable, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. I want little...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Little?

**Prabhupāda:**
My...

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What is that "my," Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Jayapatākā:**
"My" must mean massage.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Massage? Where, Śrīla Prabhupāda? On your legs?

**Prabhupāda:**
On the corner of the waist.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Corner of the waist. Both sides?

**Prabhupāda:**
No, left side.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Hmm?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
I'll put a little oil on? It's against aching. This is all right.

**Prabhupāda:**
Brisk.

**Upendra:**
[indistinct about oil]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This is that oil you liked for pains...

**Upendra:**
On the back. You had it on the back.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
...Upendra said. Should I put a little?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay.

**Jayapatākā:**
Is this mattress hard for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
No. It becomes harder, gradually. Hmm. Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that all right?

**Prabhupāda:**
Um-hmm.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This whole waist area?

**Prabhupāda:**
Hmm?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
This whole area?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Okay.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[Bengali with Prabhupāda, mentioning Bon Mahārāja]

**Prabhupāda:**
Bon Mahārāja came actually, but he did not come here.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh. Where he came to?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
He was waiting in his college.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh. Because he did not come here.

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
He said that "Go there and whether I will see Mahārāja at this time."

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
How we can give a fixed time? Actually, it's better you get a little bit stronger before receiving guests, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If you see him, you will be doing a lot of preaching and talking. He's still here in Vṛndāvana, Bon Mahārāja?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Yes.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[Bengali]

**Prabhupāda:**
Time?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What time is good, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Ten o'clock?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Tomorrow there is function.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Oh, tomorrow's function. Day after tomorrow?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
//Ha,// day after tomorrow.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Tomorrow is no good?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Day after tomorrow.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
What time is convenient?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Every day.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
For you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, any time is convenient.

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Day or night is the same for you now.

Jayapatākā: [indistinct]

**Prabhupāda:**
So day after tomorrow.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We'll send our car?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
We'll send a car, say about half past eleven?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Half past eleven, yes.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Eleven-thirty.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Good time?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Good, good.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that all right with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Half past eleven.

**Prabhupāda:**
Ask Bābājī Mahārāja.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
You also come. Where will you be?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
I am at Imlitala.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
So first we will pick you up.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[Bengali]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Yes. They will take //prasādam// here, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[Bengali]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Śrīla Prabhupāda? They will take //prasādam// here? Bhakti-caru Mahārāja cooks very, very first class Bengali //prasādam.//

**Bhavānanda:**
Very best.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
They should take here.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[Bengali with Prabhupāda]

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
The evening.

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
The evening on Saturday, er, Sunday.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
On Sunday in the evening.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Sunday evening. That means tomorrow.

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
No. Day after tomorrow.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Tomorrow is Saturday.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Tomorrow is Saturday. Day after tomorrow. Tomorrow is Saturday? //Ācchā.//

**Prabhupāda:**
So you'll stay there...

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Yeah, tomorrow is Saturday.

**Prabhupāda:**
...and they will send car.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
All right. So day after tomorrow, evening. What time?

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Evening, any time is right.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Six o'clock. You tell Bon Mahārāja, say, at... We will pick you up earlier.

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
No, I'll come to Bon Mahārāja.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Ācchā.// Then five-thirty.

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
At five-thirty.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Is that all right? Yes? And they will take //prasādam// here, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
//Ācchā.// So make it even a little later, say six-thirty.

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
Six-thirty. Not six-thirty; five-thirty.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hmm? Five-thirty's better. Okay. //Ṭhike.// Five-thirty.

**Prabhupāda:**
[Bengali]

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[laughing] Hare Kṛṣṇa.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Hare Kṛṣṇa. Bhakti-caru Mahārāja, you have to make nice //prasādam// Sunday evening.

**Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:**
[Bengali with Bhakti-caru]

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
[aside:] He's going now? So we will take him back. You arrange. Okay.

**Jayapatākā:**
[indistinct] come also?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
He'll come. Anudeśa, you arrange for the car also. Help Bhakti-caru. Is this giving you a little relief, Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
Yes. Yes.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Massaging your legs are Bhavānanda Mahārāja and Girirāja.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
I was just praying to Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma. [pause]

**Prabhupāda:**
Soda water?

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
//Bol,// Śrīla Prabhupāda?

**Prabhupāda:**
The soda water sound.

**Bhavānanda:**
Soda water?

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Soda water?

**Prabhupāda:**
You don't hear the sound of soda water?

**Bhavānanda:**
Yes, I do. Oh, that's the water bucket. [whispers: ] Someone was boiling water.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
Some water was boiling, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That was the sound of boiling water.

**Bhavānanda:**
There's water boiling in this room too.

**Svarūpa Dāmodara:**
Upendra must be boiling some water.

**Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:**
In America people always keep the teapot boiling. So similarly, here, Upendra, he always keeps a pot of water boiling, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He is always ready to serve you with warm water. Whenever you need warm water... So that's one of the things. Always there is some water boiling here. You must be very tired today, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You've done a great deal of talking. [pause] [break] [end]
